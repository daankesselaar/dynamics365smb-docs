# Norwegian VAT reporting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ID-porten in Norway has changed. Microsoft updated the Norwegian Electronic VAT submission solution to the new ID-porten system from the 23.5 release.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides features that allow you to calculate and report VAT returns to the Norwegian tax authorities.  

This article shows the typical steps that you should follow when reporting Norwegian VAT.  

This article assumes that VAT reporting is set up. For more information, see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](../../finance-setup-vat.md) and [Report VAT to Tax Authorities](../../finance-how-report-vat.md).

## Set up Business Central to generate and submit electronic VAT returns

To submit VAT returns to Norwegian tax authorities, an administrator must create a connection to ID-Porten at Digitaliseringsdirektoratet.  

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you always use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser to set up the connection to ID-Porten.

### Register your company with ID-Porten

To register your company with ID-Porten, follow the steps provided by [Samarbeidsportalen](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/id-porten/ta-i-bruk-id-porten/94). After you register, note the following information. You'll need later it when you use the assisted setup guide to authorize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to access ID-Porten.

* Valid redirection URIs
* Client ID
* Client secret

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's important to safely store the client ID and client secret of the integration point.

### Set up the integration point

After you register your company in ID-Porten, the next step is to create an integration point in your company's account in ID-Porten. For more information, see [integration point](https://docs.digdir.no/).

1. Sign in to [Skatteetaten](https://skatteetaten.github.io/mva-meldingen/english/idportenauthentication/).
2. On the navigation pane, choose **Integrasjoner**, and under **Produksjon**, choose **Ver 2**.
3. Choose **New Integration** to add a new integration point: https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no/ 
4. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

| Parameter name (Norwegian) |  Parameter description | Parameter value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Difi-tjeneste | Select the service to be assigned correct scopes. | Select **API-klient**. |
| Scopes | The application programming interfaces (APIs)/resources that the integration can access. | <p>Select the following scopes:</p><ul><li>**openid**</li><li>**skatteetaten:mvameldinginnsending**</li><li>**skatteetaten:mvameldingvalidering**</li></ul> |
| Kundens org.nr. | The organization number of the service owner. | You don't have to specify a value in this field. The required value is automatically set when the setup of the integration point is saved. |
| Integrasjonens identifikator | The unique identifier of the service. | You don't have to specify a value in this field. The required value is automatically set when the setup of the integration point is saved. |
| Navn på integrasjonen | The name of the integration as it appears in the sign-in window. | Specify **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (New)**. |
| Beskrivelse | A brief description of the service (for example, "Meeting portal for NN municipality"). | Specify **Integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**. |
| Tillatte grant types | A grant represents the user's consent to retrieve an access token. By selecting specific grants, you consent to the corresponding methods of retrieving an access token. | <p>Select the following grant types:</p><ul><li>**authorization_code**</li><li>**refresh_token**</li></ul> |
| Klientautentiseringsmetode | The method of authentication of your client. | Specify **client_secret_post**. |
| Applikasjonstype | The application (or client) type is the type of runtime environment that the client is running under. OAuth2 chapter 2.1 lists the available options. The choice of client type is a security assessment that the customer performs. | Select **web**. |
| Gyldig(e) redirect uri-er | This parameter applies only to personal sign-in integrations. It specifies the URIs that the client is allowed to go to after sign-in. | The URI is a combination of your base URI and OAuthLanding.htm. This value differs depending on whether you use Business Central online or on-premises. For online, use the following URI, `https://www.businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`. Here's an example of a URI for on-premises: `https://<hostname>/OAuthLanding.htm`. |
| Gyldig(e) post logout redirect uri-er | This parameter applies only to personal sign-in integrations. It specifies the URIs that the client is allowed to go to after sign-out. | Specify `https://skatteetaten.no`. |
| Frontchannel logout uri | The URI that the provider sends a request to upon sign-out that another client triggers in the same session. If you don't set this parameter, you risk that users remain signed in to your service when they sign out of ID-porten. | The value should be blank. |
| Frontchannel logout krever sesjons-id | This parameter applies only to personal sign-in integrations. It's a flag that determines whether the issuer and session ID parameters are passed together with **frontchannel_logout_uri**. | Leave this checkbox cleared. |
| Tilbake-uri | This parameter applies only to personal sign-in integrations. It specifies the URI that a user is sent back to when they cancel sign-in. | Specify `https://skatteetaten.no`. |
| PKCE | This parameter specifies code challenge method. | Specify **S256** |
| Authorization levetid (sekunder) | The lifetime of the registered authorization. In an OpenID Connect context, this authorization gives access to the "userinfo" endpoint. The value must be specified in seconds. | Specify **31536000** (= one year). |
| Access token levetid (sekunder) | The lifetime of the issued **access_token** in seconds. | Specify **7200** (= two hours). |
| Refresh token levetid (sekunder) | The lifetime of the issued **refresh_token** in seconds. | Specify **0** (zero). |
| Refresh token type | <ul><li>**One-time** – You get a new **refresh_token** at each refresh of **access_token**.</li><li>**Reusable** – A refresh of **access_token** doesn't change **refresh_token**.</li></ul> | Specify **Engangs**. |

### Set up electronic VAT reporting

To make it easier to set up VAT reporting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides the **Set up an electronic VAT submission** assisted setup guide. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Set up an electronic VAT submission** to start the assisted setup guide. The guide helps you complete the following steps:

* Authorize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to ID-Porten.

    On the **Electronic VAT Setup** page, enter the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Redirect URI** from your company's registration for ID-Porten. Then, choose **Open OAuth 2.0 setup page** action. On the **OAuth 2.0 Setup** page, choose the **Request Authorization Code** action to receive the token you need to connect. You need the identification number, password, and pin for a user who is allowed to submit VAT returns. After you provide those credentials, choose **MinID** as the electronic ID.
* Verify that you're using the correct VAT registration number for your company.

    A message prompts you to open the Company Information page, where you can double-check the VAT registration number for your setup.
* Update the rates for the VAT codes that require reporting.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides 32 VAT codes, however, some VAT codes don't require that you report VAT. You can automatically update the rates for VAT codes. Also, VAT codes can vary, for example, for different industries or types of business. On the **VAT Codes** page, you can use the **Edit List** action and then assign or remove the codes and rates that are relevant for your business.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The update assigns the rates that were valid in December, 2021. You are responsible for ensuring that those rates are still valid.

* Define your VAT posting setup to ensure that VAT amounts are posted to the correct accounts. For more information, see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](../../finance-setup-vat.md).
* Create a VAT statement to map the VAT business posting group with the VAT product posting group. 

    The mapping determines how you post and track VAT in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. You assign the VAT codes to use for sales and purchasing.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the settings described earlier, we automatically create a VAT report configuration for submitting returns and getting responses. You can view the configuration on the **VAT Reports Configuration** page.

#### Electronic VAT setup for existing users  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're an existing user, you need to manually change some information on the **Electronic VAT Setup** page.  

To update the electronic VAT setup for the use of the new ID-porten system, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Electronic VAT Setup** page, select the **General** FastTab, and then update the following values:

   1. In the **Authentication URL** field, specify 'https://idporten.no' 
   2. In the **Login URL** field, specify 'https://login.idporten.no'

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't open the sign in page from a bookmark or a link.

3. Close the page.

### VAT report setup

1. To set up a VAT report, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, to let users modify VAT reports that were submitted to the tax authorities, select the **Allow Modification** field.  

  If the field isn't selected, users must create a corrective or supplementary VAT report instead.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Report VAT Base** field if the VAT base must be calculated and shown to the user in the VAT reports.  
4. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Report VAT Note** field to make the **VAT Note** field available for reporting from the **VAT Return** page.  
5. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to use for standard VAT reports.  

  This is the default number series that all VAT report use.  
6. On the **Return Period** and **VAT Group Management** FastTabs, specify the relevant information.  
7. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create and submit a VAT return

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Version** field, choose **Elec VAT**.
4. Optionally, in the **KID** field, specify a payment identification number.
5. Choose **Suggest Lines** to open the **VAT Report Request Page** page, where you specify criteria for generating lines for the report.
6. After you specify the criteria, choose **OK**.  
7. On the **VAT Settlement** page, choose **Release**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] now validates that the information can be submitted to the Norwegian tax authorities.
8. To submit the VAT return, choose **Submit**. The status of the VAT return changes to **Submitted**.
9. To view whether the tax authorities accepted your submission, choose **Receive Response**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The response from the tax authority will not be immediately available.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have selected the **Report VAT Note** option in the **VAT Report Setup** page, then the **Note** field is visible and editable in the **VAT Return** page. Users can specify any free text there. The value of the **Note** field will be included in the submission message.  

## Troubleshoot your connection to ID-Porten

If you don't receive a response after you submit your return, such as within 24 hours, contact ID-Porten and ask them to verify that they received your return. To help them identify your return, you can send the value from the Message ID field. By default, the field is hidden, but you can use page inspection to get the value. For more information, see [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](../../across-inspect-page.md).  

You can also send a copy of the XML files for your submission and the response you received. To get the files, on the **VAT Return** page, choose the **Download Submission Message** and **Download Response Message** actions.  

## <a name="vat-periods"></a>Close VAT periods

To align with legal requirements, VAT periods are to be closed after settling. Normally, a fiscal year consists of six VAT periods, numbered 1 to 6. When the VAT is settled, the period is closed for further posting.  

> [!TIP]
> Not all organizations use the standard six VAT periods. Which periods the current organization uses is defined in the **VAT Period** page.

You can view information about settled periods in the **Settled VAT Period** page. The closed periods are created by the report **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** when you post VAT. If you want to post in the closed VAT period, you can open the period again by clearing the **Closed** field.  

## Tradesettlement report

Before January 2022, you used the **Tradesettlement** report to report VAT. This report is no longer described in this article, but you can read about it in the [Dynamics NAV 2016 documentation archive](/previous-versions/dynamicsnav-2016/dn283106(v=nav.90)).

# Use One VAT Code in Journals in Norway

In Norway, you can use the feature one VAT code in a journal, so that you can post VAT by using a single field, **VAT Code**. After it is set up, the one VAT code is a quick way to fill in the commonly used VAT fields.  

To set up the VAT code for purchase orders and sales orders, the corresponding VAT business posting groups and the VAT product posting groups have to be defined.  

The VAT rate is calculated from the combination of VAT business posting groups, buyer information, and VAT product posting groups.  

## To create a VAT code  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Enter information in the **Code**, **General Posting Type**, and **Description** fields for each VAT code.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to close the **VAT Codes** page.  

The following procedure explains the VAT posting setup.  

## To set up VAT posting  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **VAT Posting Setup** card, fill in the following fields:  

- **VAT Business Posting Group**  
- **VAT Product Posting Group**  
- **VAT Identifier**  
- **VAT Percentage**  
- **Sales VAT Account**  
- **Purchase VAT Account**  

4.  In the **VAT Code** field, select a code from the list.  

Now, when you post a document in the general journal and close it, the information specified in the **VAT Posting Setup** card is applied.  

For example, the VAT rate posted in the journal is defined by the setup that you have specified on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **VAT Code** and the **Bal. VAT Code**  fields have been added to the journal. The **Bal. VAT Code** is the VAT code that is used to calculate the balancing account.  
>   
>  No changes are made to the posting.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with HMRC through Making Tax Digital and supports the requirement to submit data that can help prevent fraud.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have the latest version of the Making Tax Digital app. You can read about Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom, [here](making-tax-digital-submit-vat-return.md).

The admin of the company that transmits VAT data together with fraud prevention parameters must consent one time for each web application that is used for interoperation with the HMRC VAT APIs. Otherwise, data that is collected from the user devices that are used to submit the VAT requests can't be transmitted.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that it's always the same person who submits data to HMRC from the same device. This way, the fraud prevention headers contain consistent information about the device.

## Fraud prevention headers

Fraud prevention headers are sent to HMRC whenever there's communication with the APIs at HMRC. In other words, this information is sent when one of the following actions is chosen in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]:

* Get VAT return periods
* Submit VAT return
* Get status of submitted VAT return

When you start one of these processes, you're presented with the current header content and asked for consent before any data is sent. If you choose to cancel, no information is sent to HMRC.

### Headers

In this section, we provide a list of fraud prevention headers. The content is intended to help you identify any issues with fraud prevention headers for your company.  

The set of HTTP headers that must be transmitted for fraud prevention varies, depending on the architecture of the environment that is used by the company that is interoperating with MTD for VAT. The **Gov-Client-Connection-Method** header must represent the connection method that is used for the request that the company makes. The assumption is that most companies that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online use the **WEB\_APP\_VIA\_SERVER** connection method.  

The **WEB\_APP\_VIA\_SERVER** connection method assumes transmission of headers as outlined in the following table.

| HTTP header | Description |
|--|--|
| `Gov-Client-Public-IP` | The public IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that the originating device makes the request from. |
| `Gov-Client-Public-Port` | The public TCP port that the originating device uses when it initiates the request. |
| `Gov-Client-Device-ID` | An identifier that is unique to an originating device. |
| `Gov-Client-User-IDs` | A key-value data structure that contains the user identifiers. |
| `Gov-Client-Timezone` | The local time zone of the originating device. |
| `Gov-Client-Local-IPs` | A list of all local IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) that are available to the originating device. |
| `Gov-Client-Screens` | Information that is related to the originating device's screens. The following fields are included:<ul><li> <strong>width</strong> – The reported width of the screen, in pixels</li><li><strong>height</strong> – The reported height of the screen, in pixels</li><li><strong>scaling-factor</strong> – The reported scaling factor of the screen. For example, a high-pixel density screen could have a scaling factor of 2, while a standard definition screen could have a scaling factor of 1.</li><li><strong>color-depth</strong> – The color depth of the screen, in bits.</li></ul> |
| `Gov-Client-Window-Size` | The number of pixels of the window on the originating device where the user initiated (directly or indirectly) the API call to HMRC. |
| `Gov-Client-Browser-Plugins` | A list of browser plug-ins on the originating device. |
| `Gov-Client-Browser-JS-User-Agent` | The JavaScript-reported user agent string from the originating device. |
| `Gov-Client-Browser-Do-Not-Track` | A value that indicates whether the **Do Not Track** option is turned on in the browser. |
| `Gov-Client-Multi-Factor` | A list of key-value data structures that contains details of the multifactor authentication (MFA) statuses that are related to the API call. |
| `Gov-Vendor-Version` | A key-value data structure of the software versions that are involved in handling a request. |
| `Gov-Vendor-License-IDs` | A key-value data structure of hashed license keys that are related to the vendor software that initiated the API request on the originating device. |
| `Gov-Vendor-Public-IP` | The public IP address of the servers that the originating device sent its requests to. |
| `Gov-Vendor-Forwarded` | A list that details the hops over the internet between services that terminate Transport Layer Security (TLS). |

## Populating headers

The following table explains how to identify all automatically populated headers. The guidance is based on an example from one of our reselling partners in the UK. The content is intended to help you set up fraud prevention headers for your company.  

|Header|Description  |Example  |Notes  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|`Gov-Client-Browser-Do-Not-Track` |`true` or `false`, depending on your browser's setting for tracking.         | `Gov-Client-Browser-Do-Not-Track: false`        | `false` by default. Check the value in your browser's settings. You can also search online for *do not track option in (name of browser)*.       |
|`Gov-Client-Browser-JS-User-Agent` | JavaScript-reported user agent string from the originating device. Pass the value as reported by the browser, usually in this format: `product / product-version (system-information) platform (platform-details) extensions`|`Gov-Client-Browser-JS-User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3 2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405`| Search for *device information online* to get the information about the device and the browser. Combine the values using the described format. |
|`Gov-Client-Browser-Plugins`| A list of browser plugins on the originating device. Every value in the list must be percent encoded (opens in a new tab), not percent encode separators (commas).  |`Gov-Client-Browser-P1ugins: Shockwave%20F1ash Chromium%20PDF%20Viewer`| Search for *device information online* to get the information about the device and the browser. Separate all the values with commas. Then search for *encode url online*.        |
|`Gov-Client-Local-Ips` |  IP addresses.       |<ul><li>`Gov-Client-Local-IPs:  10 .1. 2.3`</li><li>`Gov-Client-Local-IPs: 10.1. 2. 3,10.3.4. 2`</li><li>`Gov-Client-Local-IPs: 65f466e3-1f39-4ca5-957f-65e231804f91.local`</li></ul>| If you don't know your IP address, search for *how to identify my local IP*. Alternatively, use a PowerShell command as mentioned in the following table: <br>`Test-Connection -ComputerName (hostname) -Count 1 \| Select IPV4Address`|
|`Gov-Client-Public-Port`|The public TCP port used by the originating device when initiating the request. It must not be a server port, such as 80 for HTTP connections or 443 for HTTPS connections. The valid range is between 0 and 65535.|`57961`|Run ```netstat -a``` and see the TCP connection. For example, if your IP address is 192.168.45.2 and you see an entry for 192.168.45.2:57961, it means that port number 57961 is open and possibly in use. You can choose this value.|
|`Gov-Client-Screens`|Information about the originating device's screen. These fields should be submitted as a list of key-value data structures, and you can see a description of the keys in the table in the [Headers](#headers) section. |`Gov-Client-Screens: width=1920&height=1080&sca1ing-factor=1.25&colour-depth=16`|Find the details about your monitor in the display settings. Combine the values using the format.|
|`Gov-Vendor-Public-IP`|The public IP address of the servers the originating device sent their requests to.|`Gov -Vendor-Public-IP: 203.0.113.6`|Search for *what is my public ip address?*.|
|`Gov-Vendor-Forwarded`|A list that details balance of payments over the internet between services that terminate Transport Layer Security (TLS).|`Gov-vendor-Forwarded:by=203.0.113.6&for=198.51.100.0`|`by` = public ID. `for` = local IP.|

## IP addresses

Starting in 2022, you must specify an endpoint for the service that your company uses to extract and submit the IP address of the user who sends the VAT report. This is a requirement of HMRC so that they can validate the sender. The endpoint must be specified in the **User IP Address Service** field in the **VAT Report Setup** page. Learn about setting up VAT reporting, [here](../../finance-setup-vat.md#set-up-vat-reporting).  

Your company can sign up for any of the following endpoints:

* [https://api.db-ip.com/v2/free/self](https://api.db-ip.com/v2/free/self)  
* [https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace)  
* [https://api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org)  
* [https://jsonip.com](https://jsonip.com)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **User IP Address Service** field is available in version 20.1 and later. Your admin can manage your organization's version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in the admin center.

# Set up reverse charge VAT in the British version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use reverse charge VAT accounting for a specific range of items to prevent Missing Trader Intercommunity Fund Fraud (MTIC), also known as carousel fraud. This feature is supplemented by the **Reverse Charge Sales List** report. The VAT accounting changes affect companies trading in electronic goods and integrated circuit devices, such as mobile telephones, microprocessors, and central processing units. These goods apply to reverse charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]

# Brexit impact on Business Central

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The departure of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) will impact many businesses operating inside and across UK borders. As of January 1, 2021, it's likely the impact on UK businesses will revolve around these areas:

* Importing goods from the EU
* Exporting goods to the EU
* Moving goods to or from Northern Ireland

If your business performs any of the above activities, you'll likely need to make some configuration changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure to check with His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the latest information and to investigate the impact that Brexit might have on your business: [https://www.gov.uk/transition](https://www.gov.uk/transition). Microsoft will continuously monitor legislation changes due to Brexit and assess potential product impact.

## Trade across borders and the use of economic operators registration and identification numbers

Businesses in the UK are now subject to more administrative burdens when exporting and importing goods across borders, and one of these areas is with Customs. Although [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support Customs documents by default, we have added a new **EORI number** field to the **Company Information**, **Customer**, and **Vendor** pages. This field is added to the international version (W1) and is available in all versions for European countries. In the UK version, we have also added a **Supplementary VAT Reg. Number** field on the **Company Information** page for scenarios where you must provide more than one of VAT registration number. For example, this number is typically on invoices, depending on the countries/regions of the specific trade and on the movement of goods and services.

Engage your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner for assistance with adding the **EORI number** or **Supplementary VAT Reg. Number** to the relevant reports.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, to use the **EORI number**, **Supplemental VAT Reg. No.** and **Location Code** fields you must install the January 2021 Cumulative Update.

## Trade involving Northern Ireland

If part of your business is in Northern Ireland and you trade across EU borders or other European countries/regions, or your business is in one of these countries/regions and trade with a company or move goods into Northern Ireland, make sure to do the following actions:

* Add your **EORI number** and/or **Supplemental VAT Registration number** (starting with "XI") on the **Company Information** page.
* Add Northern Ireland to the **Countries/Regions** list.
* Specify this region on the relevant trading partners, such as customers and vendors.
* Specify an **EORI number** for your trading partners, such as customers and vendors.
* Specify Northern Ireland on the **Locations** page as the region for any warehouse locations you have in Northern Ireland.  

## Intrastat changes

Northern Ireland will have a dual position in the EU in areas related to the Customs Union, Single Market, VAT regime, and in the UK’s equivalents for goods (only). Goods moved in or out of Northern Ireland to or from European countries/regions must be reported on Intrastat. To handle this requirement, use Intrastat journals in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

Because Intrastat reporting is no longer needed for regular export and import for the UK, you may need to filter or delete such item movements on the **Intrastat Journal** when lines are suggested in the journal. To make it easier, we have added a **Location Code** field on the **Intrastat Journal Lines** so you can filter lines based on their **Ship-from** or **Receive-to** location.

## VAT impact on moving goods in and out of Northern Ireland

If your business has a warehouse in Northern Ireland, goods moved to that location will be subject to VAT as of January 1, 2021. When those goods are sold, VAT can be reclaimed. This and other scenarios involving the VAT process changes aren't supported by standard features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Although you may be able to configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for your business, we recommend that you engage your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner to help ensure that your configuration changes are compliant and optimal for the scenarios that are specific to your business. Your partner can also refer you to product add-ons that you might need.

## Frequently asked questions

1. **I’m using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online – where is my data stored?**

    The data for UK customers using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online is stored in data centers in the UK. If you create another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, and choose another country/region for this environment, the data is stored in data centers that serve that specific country/region. In most cases, those data centers are outside the UK, which helps ensure optimal data residency and performance.

2. **Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] support legislation in the United Kingdom?**

    In many cases, yes. As with all countries/regions for which Microsoft provides a localized version, we follow the impact of local and EU-wide legislation and evaluate how we can support our customers. The responsibility for compliance rests on the individual business in a country/region, but we provide tools and features that can help our customers meet regulatory requirements, within the confines of our product strategy. A good example of that is our feature for Making Tax Digital, which makes VAT reporting easier and fully digital. There are, however, cases where regulations may require other feature support. For example, if regulatory changes impact a vertical industry, such as construction, we expect that the Microsoft Independent Software Vendor (ISV) who provides a solution that extends [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for that industry delivers the features needed to comply. However, the business who uses the solution is responsible for compliance.

This extension makes it easy to enter addresses in the United Kingdom (UK) for entities like customers, contacts, employees, vendors, bank accounts, and so on.

The GetAddress.io UK Postcodes extension uses the **getAddress** API to find addresses in postcodes in the UK. To use the extension, you need to get a plan and an API Key for the **getAddress** API. We help you do that when you set up the GetAddress.io UK Postcodes extension. Plans are based on use, or what are sometimes referred to as "calls." A call, in this case, is when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] displays a list of addresses in a postcode. Depending on how often you add addresses, choose the plan that is best for you. If you just choose **Get API Key** you'll use the **Free** plan, which lets you add 20 addresses per day, and is valid for 30 days.

## Set up the GetAddress.io UK Postcodes extension

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Service Connections** page, choose **UK Postcode Service**.
1. On the **Postcode provider configuration** page, choose **Disabled**.
1. On the **Postal code service selection** page, choose **GetAddress.io**.
1. On the **GetAddress.io Config** page, choose **Get API Key** to open the **Plans** page on the website for the **getAddress** API.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You might need to allow pop-ups in your browser.

1. Purchase a plan, or just choose **Get API Key**, and then provide your email address.
1. Open the email from getAddress.io, and copy the API key. The key is under the **Your API Key** heading.
1. On the **GetAddress.io Config** page, paste the API key in the **API Key** field, and then choose **OK**.
1. On the **Service Connections** page, verify that the **Address Provider** field shows **GetAddress.io**. If it does, the service is enabled.

# Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom

His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) implemented the first steps of *Making Tax Digital*, which imposes new requirements on VAT registered businesses above the VAT threshold. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the first rounds of *Making Tax Digital*, which took effect in April 2019:

* Keeping records digitally
  Businesses must now keep all their records digitally. For users of finance systems, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], this requirement is already met because they already keep their records digitally.  
* Submit VAT return electronically using [software recognized by HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates).  

Since 2021, the electronic statements must also include information that helps [prevent fraud](fraud-prevention-data.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports Making Tax Digital and the GovTalk service.

## Making Tax Digital for VAT capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the VAT Return report for creating VAT reports. The Making Tax Digital VAT features extend this capability to communicate with HMRC. For example, the Making Tax Digital VAT extension lets you:

* Retrieve VAT obligations from HMRC
* Get reminded about VAT obligations that are approaching or already past due
* Submit VAT returns to HMRC  
* View the VAT return  
* View VAT payments with HMRC  
* View VAT liabilities with HMRC  

## Set up Making Tax Digital for VAT

The *Making Tax Digital* integration uses a service connection to communicate with HMRC. To make it easy to establish communications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides the **HMRC VAT Setup** service connection, which contains most of the information needed to communicate with HMRC. To finish the connection, you must give the **Dynamics 365 Business Central MTD VAT** application the authority to interact with HMRC on your behalf. Microsoft manages the **Dynamics 365 Business Central MTD VAT** application on the HMRC web site, and the application is a requirement for the connection. You give permission by requesting an authorization code from HMRC, and then copying the code to the service connection. The following steps describe how to set up the service connection.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure describes the steps to set up Making Tax Digital in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, there are some [additional steps]. Refer to the [Setup requirements for on-premises versions](#setup-requirements-for-on-premises-versions) section before you start to set up the service connection.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Service Connections** page, choose **HMRC VAT Setup**.
1. To open a GOV.UK website and request an authorization code, choose **Process**, then **Request Authorization Code**, and then choose **Continue**.  
1. Sign in with your HMRC credentials. To allow the **Dynamics 365 Business Central MTD VAT** application to interact with HMRC on your behalf, choose **Grant authority**.
1. A confirmation page displays "Authorization granted" and an authorization code. To copy the authorization code, choose **Copy**.
1. Return to the service connection you're setting up, and paste the authorization code in the **Enter Authorization Code** field. Then choose **Enter**. Note that the authorization code is valid for 10 minutes. To set up the connection, you must enter the code in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] before it expires.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses the authorization code to test whether the service connection can communicate with HMRC. If the connection is successful, a confirmation page prompts you to verify your VAT registration number. To open the **Company Information** page and verify the number is correct, and the one you used to register with HMRC, choose **Yes**.

You must also fill in the fields on the **VAT Report Setup** page. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Learn more about setting up VAT reporting, [here](../../finance-setup-vat.md#set-up-vat-reporting).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in March 2022, the **User IP Address Service** must specify an endpoint for the service that your company uses to extract and submit the [IP address](fraud-prevention-data.md#ip-addresses) of the user who sends the VAT report.

### Setup requirements for on-premises versions

1. You must add a VAT report configuration on the **VAT Reports Configuration** page.  
  
    a. Create a new configuration, and choose the VAT Return type.  
    b. Give the configuration a descriptive name, such as **HMRC MTD**.  
    c. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **745**.  
    d. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **10531**.  
    e. In the **Submission Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **10532**.  
    f. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **10533**.  
    g. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

1. You must edit the VAT report setup on the **VAT Report Setup** page.  
  
    a. Expand the **Return Period** FastTab.  
    b. In the **Report Version** field, choose the VAT report configuration that you created in the previous step.  
    c. In the **Manual Receive Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **10534**.  
    d. In the **Receive Submitted Return Codeunit ID** field, choose codeunit **10536**.  
    e. Optional: If you want to automatically update the information about VAT obligations, specify how often to do so in the **Update Period Job Frequency** field, and then specify codeunit **10535** in the **Auto Receive Codeunit ID** field.  
    f. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

1. Create an [application registration for Business Central in Azure portal](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure). When you set up the service connection in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need the following information from the registration:

    * Client ID
    * Client Secret
    * Redirect URL

## VAT obligations

HMRC maintains a list of VAT obligations for companies, which are the periods for which they must report VAT and the due date for the report. HMRC exposes this information through their APIs, which enables [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to retrieve the obligations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stores VAT obligations as **VAT Return Periods**, and uses them to:

* Remind you about VAT returns that are due or overdue.
* Automatically enter start and end dates when you create VAT returns.

### Retrieve the VAT return periods from HMRC

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, choose the **Get VAT Return Periods** action.
1. Enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** to specify the period for which to get the VAT return periods, and then choose **OK**.  

The VAT obligations are now retrieved from HMRC and you can view them on the **VAT Return Periods** page. A confirmation page shows how many obligations were retrieved.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Don't create VAT return periods manually when submitting VAT Returns to HMRC. VAT return periods must be retrieved from HMRC using the steps above. Creating them manually results in inability to submit VAT Returns.  

## VAT returns

Use this report to submit VAT for sales and purchase documents. For example, purchase and sales orders, invoices, and credit memos.

### Create and submit a VAT return

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, choose the relevant period, and then choose the **Create VAT Return** action.
1. If you want to open the VAT return, on the confirmation page, choose **Yes**.
1. On the **VAT Return** page, to calculate and prepare the amounts for the VAT return, choose **Process**, and then choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. VAT amounts display in the **Report Lines** section on the **VAT Return** page.  
1. To release the VAT return and prepare it for submission, choose **Process**, and then choose the **Release** action. After you release a VAT return, you can't edit it. If you need to change something, you must reopen the return. Releasing the VAT return doesn't submit it.
1. To submit the VAT return to HMRC, choose **Process**, and then choose the **Submit** action.  

A successful submission of the VAT Return results in a status of *Accepted* on the VAT Return. This status is based on the submission result at the HMRC. If the status after submission isn't set to *Approved*, a previously submitted VAT Return can be retrieved from the HMRC.

### Receive previously submitted VAT returns from HMRC

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, choose the relevant VAT return period.
1. On the **VAT Return Period Card** page, choose the **Receive Submitted VAT Returns** action.

### VAT return statuses

Depending on where they are in the process, VAT returns can have one of the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Open** | When you create a new **VAT Return**. This status lets you run the **Suggest Lines** action. If you need to correct values, run the **Suggest Lines** action again. You can't submit a **VAT Return** with this status. |
| **Released** | Status is changed when you manually run the **Release** action. The **Errors and Warnings** FastTab is available. You can't make changes or run the **Suggest Lines** action. To make changes, you must reopen this **VAT Return**. |
| **Rejected** | If your submission wasn't successful (for example, if authentication failed), the **VAT Return** status is changed to **Rejected**. You can't reopen the **VAT Return** from this status. |
| **Submitted** | **VAT Return** is submitted using the **Submit** action or it's marked as submitted using the **Mark as Submitted** action. |
| **Accepted** | **VAT Return** gets this status if the report is marked with the **Mark as Accepted** action. The **Accepted** status can be assigned automatically after user sends the VAT Return to the tax authority (Business Central calls the **Get VAT Returns** method and checks whether the VAT return is in the response). If the **VAT Return** report is marked as **Accepted**, you can run the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. |
| **Partially Accepted** | Business Central can assign the **Partially Accepted** status related to GovTalk information that was collected using the **Get VAT Returns** method.
| **Closed** | When request called Get VAT obligations check whether the obligation for which the user created the VAT return is closed. Business Central automatically marks the **VAT Return** as **Closed**. |

## VAT liabilities and payments

If you want to check the status of your VAT, you can retrieve information from HMRC about your VAT liabilities and payments. VAT liabilities are the amounts that you owed to HMRC, and show if there are outstanding amounts to be paid. VAT payments are the actual payments your company made to HMRC.

To retrieve VAT liabilities:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Liabilities**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Liabilities** page, choose **Process**, and then select **Get Liabilities**.
1. Enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** of the period to retrieve VAT liabilities for, and then choose **OK**.

The VAT liabilities are now retrieved from HMRC and you can view them on the **VAT Liabilities** page. A confirmation page shows how many liabilities were retrieved.

To retrieve VAT payments from HMRC:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Payments** page, choose **Process**, and then choose **Get Payments**.
1. Enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** of the period to retrieve VAT payments for, and then choose **OK**.

The VAT payments are now retrieved from HMRC and you can view them on the **VAT Payments** page. A confirmation page shows how many VAT payments were retrieved.

## Not in scope of this feature

This integration to HMRC and support of Making Tax Digital for VAT doesn't include support for:

* **Group VAT scenarios**

  If you submit VAT on behalf of a group of companies that share a VAT registration number (Group VAT), there isn't a built-in way to retrieve VAT entries from companies in the group. There are currently no plans to support Group VAT, and we refer to Microsoft partners to add this functionality.
* **Agent services**

  Agents can submit VAT returns on behalf of their customers, and HMRC has agent services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support agent services.

## Connection errors with HMRC

If you experience "The operation has timed out" errors on an on-premises installation of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], check any firewall settings that may be blocking the communication to and from HMRC.

## Testing the integration to HMRC in a sandbox

Due to a limitation at HMRC, it isn't possible to send test submissions of VAT Returns and test the integration in nonproduction scenarios. You can only send real VAT returns.  

Some online documentation at HMRC uses the term *Sandbox*. A sandbox is an environment that software developers, such as Microsoft and others, can use to test features during development. This environment isn't intended for customer testing, and it isn't related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] sandboxes.

# Purchase of Goods from an Unregistered Vendor (Reverse Charge)


Persons whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed forty lakh rupees are not required to be registered with the GST authorities. Such persons are called unregistered vendors. Any purchases from unregistered vendors do not attract GST. However, there are some notified services under GST, on supply of such services GST is applicable under reverse charge mechanism i.e. the purchasers are required to pay GST tax to the Government.

Purchase process for unregistered vendor has been explained in this document.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Select Vendor on **Purchase Invoice** header, GST vendor type should be **Unregistered**.
3. Select **Item Code** for goods, **G/L Account** for Service purchase, **Fixed Asset** for Fixed Asset purchase and **Charge (Item)** for Item Charge on **Purchase Invoice** line. GST Group Code, HSN/SAC Code and GST Credit value should be selected as **Availment** if the tax input credit is available or else **Non-Availment** should be selected on the Item or G/L Account. 
4. GST Credit option can be changed on invoice line.

For example, invoice will be issued for INR 10,000 on which 18% GST (9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST in case of Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transaction or 18% IGST in case of Inter-State transaction), has to be charged.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:

# FA Depreciation Calculation

## FA Depreciation Calculation with FA Block and Additional Depreciation

### FA Block

Depreciation is allowed on block of assets. Block of assets is a group of assets falling within a class of assets. For Example :

- Tangible assets, being building, machinery, plant or furniture,
- Intangible assets, being know how, patents, copyrights, trade-marks, licenses, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature

### Additional Depreciation

In case of any new machinery or plant acquired and installed after March 31, 2005 by an assessee who is engaged in the business of manufacturing or production of any article or thing - additional depreciation under Income Tax Act of 20% of actual cost shall be allowed. Where the asset is used for less than 180 days then 50% depreciation i.e, 1/2 of 20% (i.e. 10%) is available (Balance 50% of Additional Depreciation can be claimed in next year)

### To calculate depreciation with FA Block and Additional Depreciation

1. Go to relevant **Fixed Asset** and **Add. Depr. Applicable** field should be marked true on General Tab.
2. Select the relevant **FA Block Code** on Posting Tab of **Fixed Asset** card, **Add. Depreciation %** should have a value on the selected block code.
3. Select **Depreciation Book** as Income Tax on **Depreciation Book** of **Fixed Asset** Card.
5. Run the Calculate Depreciation batch job, fill the necessary fields and click ok to calculate depreciation. 
6. The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset journal.
7. Choose the Post action.

## FA Depreciation Calculation with Multiple Shifts

Shift depreciation is used when manufacturing companies have multiple production shifts for parts of the year. For example, a company can have one, two, or three shifts during high production season but only one shift during the rest of the year. This means that some fixed assets are used more often than normal during the high production season and they would experience greater depreciation during that time. Being able to adjust the fixed asset's depreciation rates higher makes sense if the fixed asset is active for more than one shift. User can adjust the depreciation using calculated depreciation that is unique to each shift.

### To calculate depreciation with multiple shifts

1. Go to relevant **Fixed Asset**, select **Depreciation Book** as Company on **Depreciation Book** of **Fixed Asset** Card.
2. Go to Related Information -> **Fixed Asset Shift**, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Depreciation Book Code**|Specifies the depreciation book.|
    |**FA Posting Group**|Specifies the fixed asset posting group.|
    |**Depreciation Starting Date**|Specifies the starting date of depreciation.|
    |**Depreciation Ending Date**|Specifies the ending date of depreciation.|
    |**No. of Depreciation Years**|Specifies the no. of years of depreciation.|
    |**Depreciation Method**|Specifies the depreciation calculation method.|
    |**Straight Line %**|Specifies the the Straight Line % if the depreciation method is selected as straight line.|
    |**Declining-Balance %**|Specifies the the Declining-Balance % if the depreciation method is selected as straight line.|
    |**Shift Type**|Specifies the shift type, for example Single, Double, Triple.|
    |**Industry Type**|Specifies the industry type, for example Normal, Seasonal, Non-Seasonal.|
    |**Used No. of Days**|Specifies the used number of days.|

5. Run the Calculate Depreciation batch job, fill the necessary fields and click ok to calculate depreciation.
6. The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.
7. Choose the Post action.

# Calculation of Income Tax TDS and GST on Purchase Transactions


There are certain services on which GST applies along with the provisions of TDS under income tax. TDS should not be calculated on GST amount, in some cases where payment terms is set as 100% advance, full order value has to be paid as advance payment. In such cases, amount paid to vendor will be inclusive of GST and if TDS has to deducted while paying amount to vendor, then TDS is deducted only on the base amount and not on GST amount.

## Create a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **Vendor** on **Invoice Header**.
3. Select **G/L Account** for Service purchase on **Purchase Invoice** line. GST Group Code, HSN/SAC Code should not be blank and GST Credit value should be selected as **Availment** if the tax input credit is available or else **Non-Availment** on the Item or G/L Account. 

For example, there is a purchase invoice for INR 10,000 and 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST in case of Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transaction or 18% IGST in case of Inter-State transaction) has to be charged and Income Tax TDS @10% also to be charged.

    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Initial threshold achieved value/ Opening Balance**|20,00,000|  
    |**1st Transaction, on or after 1st July 21**|2000000 – No TDS|    
    |**2nd Transaction, on or after 1st July 21**|1500000 – TDS Calculated|
    |**TDS Base Amount**|500000 (Total cumulative value 5500000 -5000000)|
    |**TDS Amount**|500 (500000*0.10%)|

  - On posting purchase invoice of second transaction, GL entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|

# Audit trail and edit logs for accounting software in India

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] complies with the new Indian tax legislation guidelines about accounting software by recording an audit trail of all transactions. It also creates an edit log for each change that's made to an account. This log records the date when the change was made.

## The legislation

Principal notifications No. G.S.R. 239(E) dated March 31, 2014, No. G.S.R. 205(E) dated March 24, 2021, amended vide notification G.S.R. 247(E) dated April 1, 2021, and amendment notification G.S.R. 624(E) dated August 5, 2022, state that, as of April 1, 2022, all businesses that use accounting software to maintain books of accounts should have an audit trail feature that includes the following functionality:

- Recording an audit trail of every transaction
- Creating an audit log of every change that's made in the books of accounts
- Capturing the date details about when changes are made
- Ensuring that the audit trail can't be disabled

Additionally, the rules state that the audit trail feature should meet the following conditions:

- It has been used throughout the year for all transactions that are recorded in the software.
- It hasn't been tampered with.
- The audit logs that were generated have been preserved by the company.
- The books of accounts and other relevant books and papers that are maintained in electronic mode must remain accessible in India at all times.

## Compliance

### Compliance 1: Recording an audit trail and creating an audit log 

Under new guidelines of the Companies Act that specify how account books must be kept in electronic format, every company that uses accounting software to maintain its books of accounts must use only accounting software that has a feature for recording an audit trail. For compliance, the system must record and trace the data sources in the audit trail.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is fully compliant with the requirement to record accounting data. The **G/L Register** page provides noneditable details about each transaction, including the register number (the **No.** field not possible to be renumbered), the creation date and time (the **Created At** field), the **User ID** of who created the transaction, and its **Source Code** and **Journal Batch Name** as additional information. Even if this transaction represents the reversing, users can find the **Reversed** field marked as **Yes**, so there's transparent information about every reversed transaction. The **General Ledger** function on the **G/L Register** page fetches the financial transaction entries that have been posted in the general ledger (G/L). This function opens the **General Ledger Entries** page that's related to the specific G/L register and shows transaction details. So, all required information exists in these tables providing full transaction and audit log.  

Additionally, you can run the **Find Entries** function to show all other related entries and source documents. For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in General Ledger](../../design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md) and [Voucher Transaction](voucher-interface-transactions.md).

For other data, you can use the **Change Log** function to track specific types of changes that are made to tables and fields. Changes that can be tracked include *inserting*, *modifying*, and *deleting* key operations. When you enable change tracking for any table, the impact on performance might vary, depending on the table's category. Change tracking can also increase the size of the database. When you track changes for a table or field, a record of every change to that table or field is stored on the **Change Log Entries** page. You can use this feature to track changes in any data in the system. For example, companies that use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to maintain books of accounts are fully compliant with the new notifications and can track transaction data to the source. For more information, see [Auditing Changes in Business Central](../../across-log-changes.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This guideline is a general guideline and can vary, depending on the specific business scenario.

### Compliance 2: Retain books of accounts in the original format

The books of accounts and other relevant books and papers are retained in one of the following formats:

- The format that they were originally generated, sent, or received in
- A format that accurately presents the information that was generated, sent, or received

The information in the electronic records will remain complete and unaltered.

Transactions that are posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] remain complete and in the format that they were initially generated in. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes no process for changing the format or content of a posted transaction. That means that the user or administrator can't change or delete any transaction using the user interface.  

> [!NOTE]
> Direct access to the database in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] technically isn't possible, so users can't make any change directly in the database. Access using the API in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] isn't direct database access. Instead, the API provides a controlled and secure way to interact with the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] application layer, which enforces business rules and validations. So, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], when a user enters or modifies information via API, the same business logic and validation rules apply as when the user does it through the user interface.

> [!NOTE]
> Audit trail for using APIs in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is absolutely the same as for the direct work using user interface, so audit trail will exist in both situations as described in previous topic.  

### Compliance 3: Preserve branch transaction information

The information that's received from branch offices isn't updated and is kept as it was originally received from the branches.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], changes can't be made to posted financial data. Therefore, financial transactions can't be edited after they're posted. However, they can be reversed by using the **Reverse Transaction** function. Data that's sent from a branch to a head office can't be changed by the head office. However, you can adjust the posted transaction through the specified mode of the transaction, such as a credit memo or general journal, that was posted in the ledger of both the branch and the head office.

### Compliance 4: Display electronic records in a legible format

The information in the electronic record of the document is shown in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and enables at least one output component per file. Typically, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] contains multiple file output components of different types. Examples include XML, XLSX, DOCX, JSON, TXT, and PDF.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that, at the very least, every transaction record can be exported or opened in Microsoft Excel format. By using a configurator in the [Data Exchange Framework](../../across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md), users can define which file format is used for specific entries.

### Compliance 5: Maintain a proper system of storage for electronic records

A proper system for storing, retrieving, displaying, and printing electronic records exists. These electronic records must not be disposed of or rendered unusable, unless those actions are permitted by law. Provided that a backup of the company's books of accounts and other books and papers is maintained in electronic mode, even in a location outside India, it will be kept on servers that are **physically located in India**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] can be deployed into a subset of Azure datacenters. Azure is generally available in datacenters and geographical locations around the world. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically be deployed in a defined region or datacenter where its customer data will be stored. By default, **Indian companies will be deployed to the [Indian datacenters](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/georeport/)**. Although Microsoft might replicate data to other regions for data durability, customer data isn't replicated or moved outside the geographical location. If an Azure region-wide outage occurs, Microsoft provides business continuity and disaster recovery for the production instance of Dynamics 365 software as a service (SaaS) applications. Paired regions reside in the same geography as their enabled set to meet data residency requirements for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes. For more information, see [Service overview](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/service-overview) and [Service Compliance](/dynamics365/business-central/compliance/compliance-service-compliance).

### Compliance 6: Information for filling out the annual financial statement

On an annual basis, the company will provide the following information to the Registrar when it files a financial statement:

- The name of the service provider.
- The set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the service provider that are used to deliver the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] service.
- The location of the service provider, wherever applicable.
- The location where the books of accounts and other books and papers are maintained in the cloud. An example is the address that was provided by the service provider.
- The location of the service provider, if it's located outside India, and the name and address of the person who's in control of the books of account and other books and papers in India.

### Compliance 7: Books of accounts must remain accessible in India

Under new guidelines of the Companies Act, the books of accounts and other relevant books and papers that are maintained in electronic mode must remain accessible in India at all times, and their backup must be kept in servers that are physically located in India on a daily basis.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is fully compliant with the requirements.

* The books of accounts and other relevant books and papers that are maintained in electronic mode in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] are accessible in India at all times for subsequent reference.
* [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides that the backup of the books of accounts and other books and papers of the company that are maintained in electronic mode in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] are kept in servers that are physically located in India on a daily basis.
* [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is automatically deployed in a defined region or datacenter where customer data will be stored. By default, Indian companies will be deployed to the [Indian datacenters](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/georeport/). Although Microsoft might replicate data to other regions for data durability, customer data won't be replicated or moved outside the geographical location.
* Administrators of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] tenant can check where the database is deployed through Dynamics 365 Business Central admin center, by looking at the **Azure Region** field.
* Microsoft provides business continuity and disaster recovery for production instances of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] SaaS application if an Azure region-wide outage occurs.
* Databases are protected by automatic backups that are kept for 28 days. The backups include data from the database's production and sandbox environments. Administrators of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] tenant can't directly access or manage these backups, because they're automatically managed by Microsoft. In Dynamics 365 Business Central admin center, an administrator can view evidence about which moment [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] has successful backups from, for all dates in a given period, together with the system screenshot that indicates the default backup frequency. Administrators can also restore their environments to a specific point in time in the past by using Dynamics 365 Business Central admin center. For more information, see [Restoring an environment in the Admin center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-backup-restore).
* If an administrator must export a database outside of cloud storage, they can run the **Create database** export from Dynamics 365 Business Central admin center at any time. In addition, administrators can access the full export history in the same admin center.
* If administrators of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] delete the environment for any reason, they can recover the environment and data as needed, because it isn't permanently deleted immediately. The environment can be recovered during a retention period that lasts seven days. For more information, see [Delete and recover environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments-delete).

# Setting Up GST Compensation Cess


Business Central has included GST Compensation Cess feature to Indian Localization.

**“GST Compensation Cess”** is levied by the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act 2017. The object of levying this cess is to compensate the states for the loss of revenue arising due to the implementation of GST on 1st July 2017 for a period of five years or such period as recommended by the GST Council. GST, being a consumption-based tax, would result in loss of revenue for manufacturing-heavy states.

All taxpayers who are engaged in the supply of selected goods or services other than exporters and composition taxpayers will collect compensation cess. This will also include compensation cess chargeable on certain goods imported to India. In case compensation cess is paid on exports, the exporter can claim refund of the same.

# Tax Engine - Use Case Configuration


This topic provides information about use case configuration.

## Use cases
Use case describes a business scenario, conditions which need to be met and event which will trigger the calculation of tax. A use case can be enabled or disabled as per the business need.  

Use Case consist of following stages for calculation:

  - **Condition**:

    Condition which determine whether the use case should be executed or not.

    Example of Condition:

     |Operator|Value|Condition|Value 2|
     |--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------|  
     |    |"Applies-to Doc No."|Not Equals|''
     |or|"Applies-to ID"|Not Equals|''
     |and|"GST Vendor Type"|Equals|'Unregistered'
     |and|"Account Type"|Equals|'Vendor'
     |and|"Document Type"|Equals|'Invoice'
     |and|"GST Bill-to/Buy-from State Code"|Equals|'Location State Code'
     |and|"GST Group Code"|Not Equals|''
     |and|"HSN/SAC Code"|Not Equals|''
     |and|"GST Reverse Charge"|Equals|'Yes'


   - **Attribute Mapping**:

     This is defined to map the required attributes with their source of value.
     Example : In case, GST is to be calculated on Sales Line and value of field ‘Type’ on General Journal Line is ‘G/L Account’ then, HSN Code will flow from G/L Account table.

   - **Rate Parameter Mapping**:

     Rate parameter needs to be mapped with their source, but this mapping will be done only for column types ‘Range’ and ‘Value’. If an applicable tax rate is found, then system will return ‘component percent’ defined for that tax rate. Example:

      |Type  |Description  |
      |---------|---------|
      |**Date**|This column will be mapped with posting date of sales header and system will analyze whether the posting date comes in the range of ‘Date from’ and ‘Date To’.|
      |**From State**|In case of sales, parameter 'From State' needs to be mapped with state of location code.|
      |**To State**|In case of Sales, parameter 'To State' needs to be mapped with state of customer code.|


   - **Use Case Variables**:

     Variables can be used at the time of computation of an intermediate value or defining validations in a use case. Example: showing alert message on tax execution.


  - **Computation Script**:

     This is an optional step, which will be used to store values in variables.
     Example: storing value of TDS Amount and adding INR 1000 freight to get the final amount.


   - **Component Formula**:

     Define ‘Component formula’ for the components which are specific to the use case. Example: CGST = {“Line Amount” from “Sales Line”} * {CGST %} /100


  - **Use Case Posting**:

    There is a posting entity where the 'G/L Accounts' are configured for the specific 'tax type'. Based on the filters applied on the posting entity, tax engine points to the record from which components can be mapped to posting accounts. In case of reverse charge, same component is adjusted with its payable or receivable account. Configuration will have “Reverse Charge” flag as true and account can be mapped for same to “Reverse Charge G/L Field Name”.


  - **Tax Ledger Mapping**:

    Calculated tax, which is an output of a use case needs to be mapped to a tax ledger table. Example: On posting of general ledger entry for GST, there will be a new GST Entry created as a tax ledger for the posted transaction.


## How to check tax information for a transaction

There are two fact boxes available on transaction page to view calculated tax

- Tax Information 
- Tax Component

Statistics Page, will show the tax information in Tax Summary Tab.

A provisional entry should be posted before posting an actual entry, on posting of actual entry, provisional entry will be reversed. As per requirement, TDS to be calculated on provisional entry and on posting of actual entry, system should not calculate TDS as it is deducted in provisional entry.

# Purchase Credit Memo or Return Order to Foreign Vendor


Purchasing goods in India from a place outside India is import of goods. For services, if the supplier is located outside India, the recipient is located in India and the place of supply is in India, then it is called Import of services. Purchase of goods and/or services from a foreign vendor are subject to reverse charge i.e. the person importing goods or services is required to remit tax to the Government.

A buyer may have to return the goods or issue credit note due to various reasons like damaged goods, quality issues etc.

Process for purchase returns to foreign vendor has been explained in this document.

## Create a purchase return order or credit memo

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Return Order or Credit Memo**, and then choose the related link.

4. GST Credit option can be changed on **Purchase Credit Memo** line.

- Purchase Credit Memo or Return Order for Imported Goods or Fixed asset, IGST is to be calculated on GST Assessable Value + Basic Custom Duty. 

For example, purchase credit memo or return order is issued for INR 10000, Custom Duty INR 1000, GST Assessable Value INR 11000 (IGST @18%) has to be charged. Calculation base:  (18% on 11,000 GST Assessable Value + 1,000 BCD) (12,000*18%).

      |Component|Amount|
      |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
      |**GST Base Amount**|11,000|
      |**Custom Duty (BCD)**|1000|  
      |**IGST**|2160|

# Tax Engine - Design Consideration


This section contains the factors that shall be considered while configuring Taxes using tax engine.

## Tax type

A new tax type should be created if it has unique attributes which are used in definition of conditions and computation logic. For example, GST and TDS are defined as different tax types. 

## Tax attributes
 - When to create an Attribute as Generic?
 
   Generic attributes are used in the same way as item attributes are managed in Business Central. If the attribute is not linked to a field in an existing table then it is generic in nature.
 - When to map a tax attribute with a table field?
 
   In case field is already available in the table which is being mapped then it can be linked to that attribute. This means that field data will be used as attribute value. 

## Generic tax rate setup
- Rate Setup for Different Tax Type
  
  Tax Rate Setup of each tax type is configured separately but the User Interface is same. Fields in tax rate setup are dynamic and based on the tax rate column setup. User can define what columns are needed for a tax rate setup. For example ‘GST' tax type would require ‘HSN Code’ where as 'TDS' tax type is not dependent on HSN code.

- Generic Table for Tax Rate Setup
  
  Use generic table for tax rate setup for all Tax types. It enables to handling any new components introduced by government related to the tax rate.
  
  Example: If there is a regulatory change in which ‘Threshold Limit’ is removed then it can be managed by removing it from the tax rate column setup.

## Generic metadata
- Tax Transaction Values
  Data pertaining to tax calculation regarding a said transaction is stored in a common table. If the transaction record is deleted then related tax transaction value also gets deleted.
  
  Example: If transaction involves ‘Purchase Line’ then all information related to tax calculation will be stored in tax transaction value. If purchase line is deleted, then tax transaction value record related to that purchase line will also be deleted.
  
  Information stored in ‘tax transaction value’ is shown in the ‘tax information’ and ‘tax component’ fact boxes related to that transaction. Attributes which have “visible on interface” as true will be visible in the fact box.

 - Tax Rate Configuration Value
 
  This table contains information of tax rate setup. Tax engine uses common tax rate setup for different types of taxes.

## Use case execution

- Only Child Use Cases are Executed for output

  There can be a parent child relation between use cases. Parent use cases are used for defining attribute mapping which is common for one or more use cases.
  
  A child use case is mapped in the use case tree. Before execution of the use case, conditions of use case tree should be passed.
  
- Sequencing of Use Case Execution

  The sequence of use case execution depends on the sequencing defined in the use case tree.

- Execution of multiple Use Cases for a tax type

  If there are more than one use cases for a tax type, then execution will be done sequentially which means that second use case will execute only after completion of first use case.

- Execution Flow of Tax Engine

  ![img.](image/executionflow.png)

## Deployment

- Configuration Files
 
  Every use case configured in tax engine is a Json file which can be exported and imported from a Business Central tenant. These configurations are deployed individually for each company.

- Deployment of Configuration

  Default configurations that are provided in the system will be available as part of demo data.

# Setting Up Tax Collected at Source (TCS), for the Section 206C(1H)

A new TCS section 206C (1H) has been introduced in finance bill 2020. As per new section, a seller has to collect TCS from buyer on any sales of Goods, where aggregate value of sales exceeds INR 50,00,000 (Threshold Amount) within same financial year. TCS to be collected on amount that is over & above INR 50,00,000, for example: Threshold amount is INR 50,00,000, TCS to be collected on amount that is more than INR 50,00,000. TCS % varies for PAN and Non-PAN customers. A Seller whose turnover is more than INR 10,00,00,000 Crore in previous financial year is eligible to collect TCS under section 206C(1H).

## Setting up TCS Section 206C(1H)

### Following is the list of setups that will be required

- [TCS Nature of Collection](tcs-overview.md#)
- [TCS Rates](tcs-overview.md#to-set-up-tcs-rates)


## To set up TCS nature of collection

TCS Nature of Collection represents the various types of payments received for which TCS rates have been specified under the provisions of section 206C(1H) of the Income Tax Act 1961. A new field 'TCS On Recpt Of Pmt.' has been added on the setup.

If this field is not selected in TCS Setup, system will calculate TCS normally, i.e. system will calculate TCS after crossing the specified threshold amount. If user selects Threshold Overlook field on NOD/NOC Lines, then, system calculates TCS normally, i.e. calculate TCS from INR 1 onwards without considering threshold amount. This field can be selected for any TCS group, there is no restriction for selecting this for only 1H.|

# Tax Engine - Configuration of Tax Type and Tax Rates


This topic provides information about tax types that a tax authority can levy in the same jurisdiction or a different jurisdiction. Calculation and posting of this type of tax to G/L Accounts.

## Tax types

There can be various type of taxes applicable for a company. Examples:

- **GST** : Goods and Services Tax.
- **TDS** : Tax deducted at source.
- **TCS** : Tax collected at source.
- **WHT** : Withholding Tax.


## Tax entities

These are tables which are specific to a Tax Type. This is defined to restrict the list of tables in a lookup. A Tax Entity can be of type ‘Master’ or ‘Transaction’.

- Example of Master: Customer, Vendor, Location, Item etc.
- Example of Transaction: Purchase Line, Sales Line, Transfer Line, Gen. Journal Line etc.


## Input parameters

Attributes of tax type that can be used as a parameter in tax calculation or reporting. For example :

**HSN Code**: It is a parameter to find GST rate of an item and it can also be used as a parameter for filing of online tax to the government.

An attribute can be either linked to a field of an existing table or can be mapped to an existing table as an attribute. (In the same way as Item Attributes are define in item table)

Header contains following information  

- Attribute Name.
- Datatype of Attribute.
- Visible on Interface (Yes/No) 
- Blocked (Yes/No)

In case the attribute needs to be mapped to a field of a table, then the field needs to be entered in 'Mapping Field Name' else it will be created as an attribute for that entity record. Attribute values can be added or viewed in case the type of attribute is an ‘option’.


## Component

Certain tax type may have components that need to be computed as part of tax calculation. Following are some examples of tax components:

- CGST: is a component of Tax Type GST.
- SGST: is a component of Tax Type GST.
- TDS: is a component of Tax Type TDS.
- E-Cess: is a component of Tax Type TDS.


## Rate setup
For each tax type, parameters are defined basis which rate is specified in the setup.

These Parameters can be of following types:

|Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Tax Attributes**|When a tax attribute is used as a parameter for tax rate configuration. (example – HSN Code, GST Group Code etc.)|
|**Value**|This will be used where we want to use a value in the tax rate configuration that is not mapped with a table as an attribute. (example – From State, To State etc.)|
|**Range**|This is used to define slabs in a tax rate setup, such as ‘Date from’ and ‘Date To’. When tax type is defined as 'range', system will create two parameters in tax rate configuration.|
|**Component**|Components are used to define distribution of tax calculated. For example, 50% of GST will go to CGST and remaining will be SGST.|
|**Output Information**|Numeric values that are part of rate setup. (Example – Threshold Amount)|

> [!NOTE]
> A new field, Allow Blank, has been added to create blank setup for tax attribute. For example, provision has been made to create tax rate for GST without HSN/SAC code, as there are scenarios where rates are common for multiple HSN/SAC code of a single GST Group.


## Tax rates
Tax rates can be defined for a combination of tax parameters defined as part of 'Rate Setup' for a 'Tax type'. Rate defined for a combination cannot be repeated.

    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|10,000|  
    |**CGST**|900|  
    |**SGST**|900|
    |**TCS**|100|

-  On posting of sales invoice, GL Entries will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|11900|

# TCS Calculation and Transactions as per Section 206C(1H)



As per new TCS rules, TCS is to be collected on receipt of payment that is over and above the threshold amount, the threshold amount is INR 50,00,000. User will receive payment from customer for sales of goods and services, TCS is to be calculated on receipt of payment for sale of goods.

Provision has been provided to enter amount on which TCS can be calculated on the event of receipt of payment from customer. In addition to it, provision for selecting posted sales lines for updating amount in 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' in payment line has been provided. By this way, user will be able to update / enter applicable amount for TCS calculation in 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' field.

When calculating TCS in payment lines, TCS Base amount will be considered from 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' field instead of transaction amount. TCS calculation on payment lines should be same as TCS calculation on Invoices. If TCS Nature of Collection selected in payment line has 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt.' field as 'TRUE' in TCS Nature Of Collection table, then system should calculate TCS with Invoice logic, where TCS is calculated on forward calculation.


## TCS calculation on customer payments under section 206C(1H).

- Create General Journal, Cash Receipt Journal or Bank Receipt Journal

  1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Journal**, **Sales Journal**, **Cash Receipt Voucher** or **Bank Receipt Voucher**, and then choose the related link.
  2. Select **Document Type** as **Payment**.
  3. Select **Customer** in Account Type and select relevant customer code in Account No. field.
  4. Fill the **Amount** field with the credit amount.
  5. Select **G/L Account** or **Bank Account** in Bal. Account Type and select relevant expense account in Bal. Account. No. field.
  6. Select relevant **TCS Nature of Collection** in journal line. **Location Code** and **T.C.A.N No.** fields should not be blank.
  7. **TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount** can be updated in two different ways. One is you can put the amount directly in this field, else you can go to **Action** > **Function** > **Get Open Posted Lines For TCS Payment**, and select sales lines that are applicable for receipt of payment. System will update sum of the selected lines in 'TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' field on payment journal line.
  8. If TCS Nature of Collection selected in payment line has **TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt.** field marked as 'TRUE' in TCS Nature Of Collection table, then system should calculate TCS on **TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount**, and should not calculate TCS on line amount.


### TCS to be calculated on customer receipt (through general journal, cash receipt journal and bank receipt journal)

For example, payment has been received from customer for INR 1,00,000 on which 0.10 % TCS is applicable for Nature of Collection '1H', 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' is INR 75,000 hence 'TCS Base Amount' is also INR 75,000.
  
  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|75,000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|75 (75000 x 0.10 %)|

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account**|100000|
    |**Customer Account**|-100000|
    |**Customer Account**|75|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-75|
    
## TCS calculation on customer payments under section 206C(1H) and where GST is also applicable.

- Create General Journal, Cash Receipt Journal or Bank Receipt Journal

  1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Journal**, **Sales Journal**, **Cash Receipt Voucher** or **Bank Receipt Voucher**, and then choose the related link.
  2. Select **Document Type** as **Payment**.
  3. Select **Customer** in Account Type and select relevant customer code in Account No. field.
  4. Fill the **Amount** field with the credit amount.
  5. Select **G/L Account** or **Bank Account** in Bal. Account Type and select relevant expense account in Bal. Account. No. field.
  6. Select relevant **TCS Nature of Collection** in journal line. **Location Code** and **T.C.A.N No.** fields should not be blank.
  7. **TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount** can be updated in two different ways. One is you can put the amount directly in this field, else you can go to **Action** > **Function** > **Get Open Posted Lines For TCS Payment**, and select sales lines that are applicable for receipt of payment. System will update sum of the selected lines in 'TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' field on payment journal line.
  8. If TCS Nature of Collection selected in payment line has **TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt.** field marked as 'TRUE' in TCS Nature Of Collection table, then system should calculate TCS on **'TCS On Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount'**, and should not calculate TCS on line amount.
  9. Select **GST Group Code** and **HSN/SAC** Code then click on **GST on Advance Payment**. GST should be calculated normally as back ward calculation.

### TCS to be calculated on customer receipt (through general journal, cash receipt journal or bank receipt journal)

For example, payment has been received from customer for INR 1,00,000 on which 0.10 % TCS is applicable for Nature of Collection '1H', 'TCS on Recpt. Of Pmt. Amount' is INR 55,000 hence 'TCS Base Amount' is also INR 55,000. GST 18% will also be charged.
  
  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**TCS Base Amount**|75,000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|55 (55000 x 0.10 %)|
    |**GST Base Amount**|84,745.76|
    |**GST Amount**|15,254.24 (84745.76*18/100)|

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Bank Account**|100000|
    |**Customer Account**|-100000|
    |**Customer Account**|55|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-55|
    |**GST Receivable**|15,254.24|
    |**GST Payable**|-15,254.24|

# Purchase Return to Unregistered Vendor (Reverse Charge)


Persons whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed forty lakh rupees are not required to be registered with the GST authorities. Such persons are called unregistered vendors. Any purchases from unregistered vendors do not attract GST. However, there are some notified services under GST, on supply of such services GST is applicable under reverse charge i.e. the purchasers are required to  pay GST to the Government.

A buyer may have to return the goods or issue credit note due to various reasons like damaged goods, quality issues etc.

# Setting Up GST for Bank Charges 


As per GST Law, GST is applicable on bank charges and ITC can be availed for specified services.  As per Rule 54(2) of CGST Rules, 2017, Banks shall issue a tax invoice or any other document in lieu of tax invoice. In case if an invoice is not provided by the bank, then the bank statement shall be deemed to be an invoice. Such document shall be construed as Tax invoice even if it is not serially numbered and whether or not it contains the address of recipient of taxable service. 

Bank charges can be Intrastate or Interstate. CGST & SGST are applicable if the bank and customer are located in the same state. IGST is applicable if both are in different states. 

The place of supply of banking and other financial services to any person shall be the location of the recipient of services on the records of the supplier of services. If the location of recipient of services is not on the records of the supplier, the place of supply shall be the location of the supplier of services. 

The place of supply of banking and other financial services shall be the location of the supplier of services. If any services are received from a foreign bank by an Indian customer, then the place of supply for such services becomes the place where the foreign bank is located i.e. outside India and hence any charges collected towards such services are not subject to India GST.

# TCS with threshold


This article explains the requirement of threshold amount in TCS and  the process of calculating TCS for such transactions.

## TCS calculation considering threshold limits

TCS threshold defines the threshold limit for each TCS Nature of Collection.  TCS can be deducted only if the total transaction with the assessee exceeds the threshold limit in the financial year.

If a payment under TCS Type A is below Threshold INR 20,000, no tax is collected. Another factor to be considered is the aggregate of total payments to be made in a year. If for a customer it's expected that the threshold limit would be crossed eventually, it means Threshold is overlooked. Hence, payments received from customers can cross the TCS threshold of INR 20,000. However, if the payment expected is below the threshold limit defined, TCS won't be collected.

1. GL Entries for TCS where payment is less than the threshold limits, as follows:
    
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|19000|
    |**Sales Account**|-19000|

2. GL Entries for TCS where payment is more than (exceeding) Threshold limits, as follows:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account**|10000| 
    |**TCS Payable Account**|287| 
    |**Customer Account**|-9713|

A composite vendor is a vendor whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed fifty lakh rupees and has opted for composition scheme. A composite vendor neither collects tax from the recipient of supplies nor passes on any credit of input tax. Hence, no GST is computed if the purchases are made from a composite vendor. 

A composite vendor has to register himself with the GST authorities and hence registration no. is mandatorily mentioned in the vendor card, if the vendor type is selected as composite. State code is also mandatory. No GST entries are generated for a composite vendor, as a composite vendor is not entitled to collect any tax from the customers. 

Process for purchases from a composite vendor has been explained in this document.

## Create a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **Vendor** on **Purchase Invoice** header, GST vendor type should be **Composite** or **Exempted**.

# GST on Advance Payment or Normal Payment Application with Purchase Invoice


An advance payment made to vendor for a transaction that is subject to reverse charge is to be reported in GSTR-2. 

If the advance payment is applied to the invoice in the same month, then such applications need not be disclosed in GSTR-2. However, if advance payment is paid in a month and is applied to invoice in the subsequent month, then this application is to be reported in GSTR-2. 

Process for application and un-application of payment and invoice has been explained in this document


## GST on advance payment and application with purchase invoice

 GST is liable at the time of advance payment to vendor, for example, service amount is INR 20000 and advance payment made to vendor for INR 10000 and 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST) has to be charged. Taxpayer paying advance is not eligible to claim ITC on advance paid. The taxpayer can claim ITC on advance paid only on receipt of services.

- GST calculation for Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transactions will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|10,000|  
    |**CGST**|900|  
    |**SGST**|900| 

- GL Entries for advance payment made to vendor, will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Vendor Account**|10,000|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|-900| 
    |**CGST Payable Account**|-900| 
    |**Bank Account**|-10000| 


Later invoice for service purchase issued by vendor for INR 20,000 and 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST), will be charged.

- GST Calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:

    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|20000|  
    |**CGST**|1800|  
    |**SGST**|1800| 


- GL Entries for application of an advance payment with an invoice for services, where input tax credit is available:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Service Account**|20000|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|1800| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|1800|
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-1800|
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-1800| 
    |**Vendor Account**|-20000| 
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|   
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**CGST Receivable Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable  Account**|900|
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-1800|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-1800|


- GL Entries for application of an advance payment with an invoice for services, where input tax credit is not available:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Service Account**|23600|  
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-1800| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-1800|
    |**Vendor Account**|-20000|
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|
    **CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|

If this is found that the payment and invoice was wrongly applied and the application needs to be reversed, in such a case un-apply functionality can be used. Un-application entries are same for both online application and offline application.

- GL Entries for un-application of an advance payment with an invoice for services, where input tax credit is available:
    
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|1800| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|1800| 
    |**CGST Receivable Account**|-900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable Account**|-900|
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900|
            
- GL Entries for un-application of an advance payment with an invoice of services, where input tax credit is not available:
    
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900| 
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900|

## Normal payment to vendor and application with purchase invoice

For unregistered, import vendor and reverse charge purchase of service from registered vendor, user has to post a separate invoice for goods and services in the system. No GST calculation is done at the time of application.
In ordinary course, when a normal payment is applied to the invoice, system proportionately posts the liability from Payable Interim Account to Payable Account and credit (if applicable) from Receivable Interim Account to Receivable Account. 

For example, Purchase Invoice for service purchase issued to vendor for INR 60,000 and 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST), has to be charged. Later a payment of INR 10,000 has been made to vendor against to the purchase invoice, which doesn't have any GST impact.

- GST Calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Total GST Transactional Value**|60000| 
    |**Invoice Total CGST Amount**|5,400 (60000*9%)| 
    |**Invoice Total SGST/UTGST Amount**|5,400 (60,000*9%)|  
    |**Normal Payment Applied**|10000| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Amount = Invoice Total SGST/UTGST amount x (Normal Payment Applied/Total Transactional Value)**|900 (5,400*(10,000/60,000)|
    |**CGST Amount = Invoice Total CGST amount x (Normal Payment Applied/Total Transactional Value)**|900 (5,400*(10,000/60,000)|

- GL Entries for Application of invoice with normal payment:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Vendor Account**|10000|  
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**CGST Receivable Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable Account**|900|
    |**CGST Payable Account**|-900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|-900|
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|  
    |**Bank Account**|10000|

If this is found that the payment and invoice was wrongly applied and the application needs to be reversed, in such a case un apply functionality can be used. Un-application entries are same for both online application and offline application.

- GL Entries for un-application of invoice with normal payment:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**CGST Payable Account**|900|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|900|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable Account**|-900|
    |**CGST Receivable Account**|-900|

# TCS Adjustment Entries


TCS adjustment is applicable for any correction of the TCS amount, TCS rate and TCS base amount already calculated but not paid to the government authorities. Provision is available to enter the new TCS rates, new TCS amount and new TCS base amount for the TCS entry which was created against invoice or payment and not paid to the government authorities. System should recalculate TCS amount and adjustments would be made accordingly. The revised TCS amount should be updated in the relevant GL Accounts for TCS Payable and Customer Account. Existing TCS entry should be updated with revised TCS percentages, TCS amount and TCS base amount.

## TCS adjustment process

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **TCS Adjustment Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant transaction number in **Transaction No.** field from the drop down, and the selected line, will get populated with the posted record. Following information can be changed, in the adjustment journal as per the requirements:
  
    |Field Name|Use|

# E-Invoice


E-invoice does not mean that an invoice should be generated from a software on the computer or point of sales (POS) machine, central portal of tax department, as any such centralization will bring unnecessary restriction on the way trade is conducted.

E-Invoice generated by each software may look more or less same, however, they can’t be understood by another computer system even though business users understand them fully. There are hundreds of accounting/billing software that generate invoices, but they all use their own formats to store information electronically and data on such invoices can’t be understood by the GST System if reported in their respective formats. Hence, a need was felt to standardize the format in which electronic data of an Invoice will be shared with others to ensure there is interoperability of the data. The adoption of standards will in no way impact the way user would see the physical (printed) invoice or electronic (ex pdf version) invoice. All these software would adopt the new e-Invoice standard wherein they would re-align their data access and retrieval in the standard format. However, users of the software would not find any change since they would continue to see the physical or electronic (PDF/Excel) output of the invoices in the same manner as it existed before incorporation of e-invoice standard in the software.

## E-Invoice feature in Business Central

Business Central has included E-Invoice feature to Indian Localization.

- Provision for exporting invoice details in json (GSTIN provided schema V-1.01) format is provided.
- User can generate json file from **Posted Sales Invoice** > **Action** > **Generate E-Invoice**. On clicking **Generate E-Invoice** button on posted sales invoice, system generates and saves the file.
- User can generate json file from Posted **Sales Credit Memos** > **Action** > **Generate E-Invoice**. On clicking  **Generate E-Invoice** button on posted sales credit memo, system generates and saves the file.
- Importing signed E-Invoice json file facility is available. User can import json file from **Posted Sales Invoice** > **Action** > **Import E-Invoice Response**. On importing E-Invoice response, system will update below details into system.

    - Acknowledgement No
    - Acknowledgement Date
    - IRN Hash
    - QR Code

  In the same way E-Invoice Response can be imported in Posted Sales Credit Memo.

> [!NOTE]
> System will validate IRN Hash while importing Signed E-Invoice into system, System will import only if IRN Hash is matched, system will skip other files.

- A provision has been provided to create Json file automatically on posting of sales transaction. A new field is created in **General Ledger Setup** > **Tax Information** Tab > **Generate E-Invoice on Sales Post**. On enabling this field, system will create and save json file on posting of sales transaction. System will also generate IRN Hash on posting of sales invoice, if this field is disabled, system will not create json file and IRN Hash in posted transaction automatically. However, user can create json file and IRN Hash from posted document.
- Provision has been provided to record **E-Way Bill No.** on **Tax Information** tab in **Posted Sales Invoice**. E-Way Bill details are included in E-Invoice json file, user will be able to export E-Invoice along with E-Way Bill details.
- Provision has also been provided for cancellation of E-Invoice. Json file for cancellation of e-invoice is available. User needs to put **E-Inv. Cancelled Date** and **Cancel Reason** on **Tax Information** Tab of **Posted Sales Invoice**, then go to **Posted Sales Invoice** > **Action** > Click on **Cancel E-Invoice** and again **Generate E-Invoice** for the revised json file.

    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|10100|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-100|
    |**Sales Account**|-10000|

## TCS to be calculated on customer advance payment (through general journal, cash receipt journal)

For example, advance payment received from customer for INR 10,000 on which 1% TCS is applicable for Nature of collection 'Scrap'

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|99 (10000x1%/101)|

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account**|10000|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-99|
    |**Customer Account**|-9901|

## Adjustment of calculated TCS on advance payment against sales invoice

TCS which has been calculated on advance payment can be adjusted while creating Sales Invoice against that advance payment. TCS will not be calculated on Customer Invoices if advance payment, on which TCS has already been calculated, is applied to the invoice. System should check the TCS base amount on which TCS has been calculated on advance payment with the line amount of Sales Invoice and TCS will only be calculated on the line amount which is more than the TCS base amount. For example: If TCS base amount was 10,000.00 in advance payment and line amount is 20,000.00 on sales invoice, then TCS will be calculated on 10,000.00 on sales invoice.

  - GL Entries for TCS on Customer advance payment using Cash Receipt Journal, will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account**|10000|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-99|
    |**Customer Account**|-9901|

  - GL Entries for TCS on Customer Invoice using Sales Invoice against advance payment, will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|20101|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-101|
    |**Sales Account**|-20000|

> [!NOTE]
> TCS is calculated after adjusting the TCS amount which was earlier calculated on advance payment.


## TCS to be calculated on non-resident customer invoice in foreign currency

For example, invoice has been raised to foreign customer for USD 10,000 on which 1% TCS is applicable for Nature of collection 'Scrap'. All foreign currency amounts will get converted into INR based on currency exchange rates. Exchange rate considered for this example is 1 USD = 65 INR.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|USD 10000 or INR 650000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|INR 6500(650000x1%)|

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|656500|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-6500|
    |**Sales Account**|-650000|



## TCS calculation on higher rate if customer is not having PAN

For example, invoice has been raised to customer for INR 50,000 on which 1% TCS is applicable for Nature of collection 'Scrap'. But if there is no PAN available for customer then higher TCS of 5% is applicable.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|50000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|2500(50000x5%)|

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|52500|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-2500|
    |**Sales Account**|-50000|

## TCS calculation on multiple nature of goods in single invoice

For example, invoice has been raised to customer for INR 1,00,000. INR 50,000 each towards two nature of goods 'Scrap' and 'Timber'.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|100000|  
    |**TCS Amount on Scrap**|500(50000x1%)|
    |**TCS Amount on Timber**|2500(50000x5%)

  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|103000|
    |**TCS Payable Account - Scrap**|-500|
    |**TCS Payable Account - Timber**|-2500|
    |**Sales Account - Scrap**|-50000|
    |**Sales Account - Timber**|-50000|

## TCS on sale of scrap @ lower rate

For example, invoice has been raised to customer for INR 1,00,000 towards sale of Scrap. Customer has a certificate of income tax at Lower rate @ 0.5% on Scrap instead of normal rate.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|100000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|500(100000x0.5%)|
    
  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|103000|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|-500|
    |**Sales Account**|-100000|

## TCS on sale of scrap @ zero rate

For example, invoice has been raised to customer for INR 1,00,000 towards sale of Scrap. Customer has a certificate of income tax at Zero rate @ 0% on Scrap instead of normal rate.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|100000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|0(100000x0%)|
    
  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|100000|
    |**Sales Account**|-100000|

## TCS to be calculated on sales return (sales return order or sales credit memo)

For example, sales return from customer for INR 10,000 on which 1% TCS is applicable for Nature of collection “Scrap”.

  - In this case TCS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TCS Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**TCS Amount**|100(10000x1%)|
    
  - GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sales Account**|10000|
    |**TCS Payable Account**|100|
    |**Customer Account**|-10100|

> [!NOTE]

# Purchase Return of Services for Overseas Place of Supply to Registered Vendor


The supply of goods or services or both when the supplier is located in India and the place of supply is outside India shall be treated to be a supply of goods or services or both in the course of inter-state trade or commerce.

The process of computing tax on purchase return to a vendor with overseas place of supply has been explained in this document.

## Create a purchase return order or purchase credit memo

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Return Order** or **Purchase Credit Memo**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **Vendor** on **Purchase Credit Memo** header, GST vendor type should be **Registered**.
3. Select **G/L Account** on **Purchase Credit Memo** line. GST Group Code, HSN/SAC Code and GST Credit value should be selected as **Availment** if the tax input credit is available or else **Non-Availment** in the G/L Account. 
4. GST Credit option can be changed on **Purchase Credit Memo** line.

For example, if a service recipient has a GSTIN for West Bengal and the Vendor has a GSTIN in West Bengal, but the place of supply is outside India. In this case, IGST will be charged as place of supply is outside India. So, return order or credit memo will be issued for INR 10,000 on which 18% IGST, has to be charged.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|10,000|  
    |**IGST**|1800|  

- GL Entries for Return or Credit Note of services for overseas place of supply from registered vendor where input tax credit is available, will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Services Account**|11800|  
    |**IGST Receivable Account**|-1800|  
    |**Vendor Account**|-10000|

- GL Entries for Return or Credit Note of services for overseas place of supply from registered vendor where input tax credit is not available, will be as following:

# Setting Up Tax Deducted at Source (TDS), as per the Provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961



Business Central has included Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) Feature to Indian Localization.

**TDS** means **Tax Deducted at Source**. The concept of TDS was introduced with an aim to collect tax from the very source of income. As per this concept, a person (deductor) who is liable to make payment of specified nature to any other person (deductee) shall deduct tax at source and remit the same into the account of the Central Government

Income from several sources is subjected to TDS. Presently this concept of TDS is also used as an instrument in enlarging the tax base. Some of such incomes subjected to TDS are salary, interest, dividend, interest on securities, winnings from lottery, horse races, commission and brokerage, rent, fees for professional and technical services, and payments to non-residents.

The Income Tax Act, 1961 specifies that tax deduction is to be made, for the specified incomes, on credit or on payment, whichever is earlier.

# GST Settlement of Net Payment Liability


## Settlement refers to discharge of tax liability to the government. Tax liability arises for scenarios mentioned below:
- Outward Supplies (Sales, Transfers)
- Inward Supplies that are subject to Reverse charge (Purchases, Inward Transfers)
- Credit Reversal Adjustments 
- Negative Credit from Purchase Transactions 
- Negative Credit for ISD Distributions 

This tax liability on both interstate transactions (IGST) and intrastate transactions (SGST/UTGST, CGST) is to be discharged on a monthly basis to the government. GST paid on purchase transactions can be taken as credit subject to certain conditions. Such credit can be offset against the tax payable on Sales. Hence, GST payable on sales transactions can be discharged by payment of cash or utilization of credit or both. Reverse charge Liability shall always be discharged in cash. Credit can be availed in the month of tax remittance to the government. Credit utilized can be credit pertaining to the same component or different components.

- As per GST Law, credit of IGST, CGST and SGST/UTGST shall be claimed in the chronological order as given below:

  2. Select **Vendor** in Account Type and select relevant vendor code in Account No. field. Select **G/L Account** in Bal. Account Type and select relevant expense account in Bal. Account No. field.
  3. Select relevant **TDS Section** on journal line.  **Location Code** and **T.A.N No.** fields should not be blank.

- Create Purchase Invoice or Purchase Order

  2. Select **Vendor**, **Location Code** on **Purchase Order** or **Purchase Invoice** header
  3. Select **G/L Account** on **Purchase Order** or **Purchase Invoice** line.
  s4. **TDS Section**, **Location Code** and **T.A.N No.** fields should not be blank.

### TDS to be calculated on vendor invoice (through general journal, purchase journal, purchase invoice or purchase order)

In the given scenario, vendor has issued an invoice for INR 50,000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS Section 194C.
  
  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|50000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|1000 (50000*2%)|

  - On posting of invoice, GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Expense Account**|50000| 
    |**TDS Payable Account**|-1000| 
    |**Vendor Account**|-49000|

### TDS to be calculated on vendor advance payment (through general journal or payment journal)

In the given scenario, advance payment made to vendor for INR 50,000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS Section 194C.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|50000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|1000 (50000*2%)|

  - On posting of advance payment, GL Entries will be as following:

    |**Expense Account**|50000|
    |**TDS Payable Account**|-1000|
    |**Bank Account**|-49000|

On receiving the invoice from the vendor, TDS will be calculated on the differential amount. Suppose vendor sent an invoice of INR 120000. Since TDS has already been calculated at the time of payment, at the time of invoicing TDS will be calculated on the remaining amount i.e. INR 70000 (1200000 - 50000).

> [!NOTE]
> Advance payment needs to be applied with the invoice before posting. Otherwise TDS will be calculated on the whole invoice amount.

### TDS to be calculated on non-resident vendor invoice in foreign currency

In the given scenario, vendor issued an invoice for USD 10000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS Section 195. All USD amounts will get converted into INR based on currency exchange rates. For this example exchange rate has been considered as USD 1 = INR 65.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|USD 10000 or INR 650000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|INR 13000 (INR 650000*2%)|

  - On posting invoice, GL Entries, will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Expense Account**|650000|
    |**TDS Payable Account**|-13000|
    |**Vendor Account**|-637000|

> [!TIP]
> Nature of Remittance and Act Applicable are mandatory for NRI Payments.

### TDS calculation on higher rate if vendor is not having PAN

PAN of vendor is mandatory for TDS calculation, but in case PAN is not available, higher rate of TDS will be deducted from the vendor.

In the given scenario, vendor issued an invoice for INR 50000 on which 2% TDS is applicable under TDS section 194C, but PAN is not available for vendor. In such a case 20% TDS will be charged as a higher rate.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|50000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|10000 (50000*20%)|

  - On posting invoice, GL Entries, will be as following:

    |**TDS Amount**|10000 (100000*10%)|

  On posting invoice, GL Entries will be as following:
     
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Expense Account**|112360|
    |**TDS Payable Account**|-10000|
    |**Vendor Account**|-102360|

### TDS calculation on multiple expenses in a single invoice

A single invoice can be raised by the vendor for multiple expenses. For example, vendor issued a single invoice for INR 100000; INR 50000 each towards two services under TDS Section 194C and 194J.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|100000|  
    |**TDS percent for 194C**|1000 (50,000x2%)|

    |**TDS Payable Account (194J)**|-5000|
    |**Vendor Account**|-94000|


### TDS on expenses at lower rate or zero rate

If a vendor has a certificate of concessional rate instead of normal rate then to handle that scenario, concessional codes can be configured and attached to those vendors.

In the given scenario, vendor issued an invoice for INR 100000 towards professional services. Vendor has a certificate of income tax at Lower rate @ 5% on professional services instead of normal rate.

  - In this case TDS calculation will be as following:

    |Component|Value|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**TDS Base Amount**|100000|  
    |**TDS Amount**|5000 (100000*5%)|

# Setting Up Tax Collected at Source (TCS), as per the Provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961



Business Central has included Tax Collected at Source (TCS) Feature in Indian Localization.

**TCS** means **Tax Collected at Source** is one of the methods for tax collection by the government. It follows the principle of ‘You pay while you earn’. While ‘Tax Deducted at Source’ (TDS) requires the payer to deduct tax at source and remit the tax to the Government, ‘Tax Collected at Source’ (TCS) requires the receiver or seller to collect tax at source and remit it to the Government. The purpose of this provision is to eliminate tax evasion in certain trades.

## Setting up TCS

### TCS has two types of setup.

- Automatic - These setup are done through Tax Engine.
- Manual - These setups are done manually by the business users.

### Following is the list of setups that will be pre-configured with the help of **Tax Engine**

- Tax Types
- Tax Entities
- Components
- Attributes
- Rate Setup


For more information about Auto Setup, see **Tax Engine** Information.

### The following are required to be setup manually

- [TCS Rates](tcs-overview.md#to-set-up-tcs-rates)

- [General Voucher Setup](vouche-interface-overview.md#to-set-up-voucher-setup)


## To set up general journal template

Journals are used for different types or groups of entries, such as purchases, payments, sales, and receivables. Each journal type is set up with its own journal template. Journal templates provide the basic journal structure where business users can specify default information for all batches created using the template.

However, since these settings are defaults, business users can change them for a specific journal batch.
Batches are typically used to separate one user's entries from another. For example, User-A and User-B both work on general journal entries. User-A typically makes entries and posts them later when they are approved. To keep User-B's entries from becoming mixed with User-A's entries, separate batches can be assigned to the two users.

# Purchase Return to Registered Vendor


A registered vendor is a person who is registered with GST authorities. 
For purchases from registered vendors for services attracting reverse charge, purchasers themselves has to pay tax to the government.
If exempted goods and services are purchased from registered Vendor, then no GST is to be paid to supplier or to the Government.

A buyer may have to return the goods or issue credit note due to various reasons like damaged goods, quality issues etc.

# GST on Advance Payment Made to Vendor, with Reverse Charge


The tax needs to be paid if supplier gets the payment first, therefore we need to calculate GST at the time of advance payment made to the vendor. However, when ‘supplier of goods’ receives advance payment, they aren't required to pay GST at the time of the receipt of advance payment, while GST is required to be paid in case of supply of services.

The process of GST calculation on advance payment to vendor has been explained in this document.

### Create a general journal or a bank or cash payment voucher

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Journal** or **Bank Payment Voucher** or **Cash Payment Voucher**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Select **Vendor** in account type and select relevant **Vendor Code**, GST vendor type and registration number should be filled in vendor master.
3. Select **G/L Account** or **Bank Account** in balancing account type, and select the cash or the bank account. 
4. Advance Payment made to vendor does not include tax payment, as the purchaser is liable to pay tax under reverse charge. Hence, tax is applied straight away on base. 
5. GST on Advance Payment field needs to be activated on General Journal Line for computation of GST on Advance Payment. In addition, GST Group code and GST Place of Supply should not be blank for computation of GST.

For example, advance payment made to vendor against supply of services of INR 10,000 on which 18% GST (9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST in case of Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transaction or 18% IGST in case of Inter-State transaction) has to be charged.

- GST Calculation will appear in the Fact Box as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|10,000|  
    |**CGST**|900|  
    |**SGST**|900|
    |**IGST**|1800|

- GL Entries for Advance Payment made to Vendor, will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Vendor Account**|10,000|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|-900|
    |**CGST Payable Account**|-900|
    |**Bank Account**|-10000|

## Reversal of advance payment made to vendor, where there are reverse charges

If the vendor advance needs to be corrected or the entry is wrongly posted, in such a case the entry can be reversed and new entry can be created.

- Reversal GL Entries for Advance Payment made to Vendor, will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account**|10000| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|900|
    |**CGST Payable Account**|900|
    |**SGST/UTGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|  
    |**CGST Receivable (Interim) Account**|-900|
    |**Vendor Account**|-10,000|  
    
> [!TIP]
> In case of Inter-State Advance Payment, IGST will be calculated.

# GST on Advance Payment and Application with Sales Invoice


GST can also be liable at the time of receiving advance payment from customer. If advance payment is applied to an invoice in the same month, then such applications need not be disclosed in GSTR-1. However, if advance payment is paid in a month and is applied to invoice in the subsequent month, then this application needs to be reported in GSTR-1.

Process of application of advance payment from customer and sale invoice has been explained in this document.

For example, service amount is INR 20000 and customer made an advance payment of INR 10,000 and 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST) has to be charged on the advance payment.

- GST Calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|10,000|
    |**GST Transactional Value**|8,474 (10000*100/118)|
    |**CGST**|763 (8,475*9%)|  
    |**SGST**|763 (8,475*9%)|

Later sales invoice for services is issued to the customer for INR 20,000. 18% GST (i.e. 9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST in case of Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transaction or 18% IGST in case of Inter-State transaction) has to be charged on the invoice amount.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:

    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GST Base Amount**|20000|  
    |**CGST**|1800|  
    |**SGST**|1800|

- GL Entries for application of advance payment with sales invoice, will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Customer Account**|23600|  
    |**CGST Payable Account**|-1800|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|-1800| 
    |**Sales Account**|-20000| 
    |**CGST Payable Account**|763| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|763| 
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-763|   
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|-763|  

## GST un-application of customer advance with sales invoice

If this is found that the payment and invoice was wrongly applied  and the application needs to be reversed, in such a case un apply functionality can be used. Un-application entries are same for both online application and offline application.

> [!TIP]
> An advance receipt and invoice application cannot be unapplied, if the tax liability on both is discharged through GST Settlement Screen.

- GL Entries for un-application of an advance payment and sales invoice:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**CGST Payable (Interim) Account**|763|  
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable (Interim) Account**|763|  
    |**CGST Payable Account**|-763| 
    |**SGST/UTGST Payable Account**|-763| 


> [!TIP]
> In case of Inter-State Sale, IGST will be calculated.

If the TDS is deducted by the customer (deductor), then the user (deductee) has to calculate TDS on the invoice or revenue and keep a track of TDS deducted. The deductor has to provide the deductee a TDS certificate.

# GST Reconciliation


This topic explains the setups and process of GST reconciliation.

## Overview

- Line wise details of all invoices, supplementary invoices, debit notes and credit notes issued by a vendor or supplier towards Outward supplies made during a month shall be reported in GSTR-1 by 10th of the succeeding month.
- Sales uploaded by the supplier or vendor in GSTR-1 are auto-reflected in GSTR-2A and GSTR-2 of the buyer as Inward supplies. For example, if the buyer purchases goods or services from 100 vendors in a month, the details of all such purchases will be reflected in GSTR-2A & GSTR-2 of the buyer, provided all 100 vendors have uploaded their sales in GSTR-1.
- Purchase transactions posted in the system for preceding month shall be reconciled with the supplier-uploaded information in GSTR-2A. However, there may be certain discrepancies between the two, due to the following reasons:
  - Supplier or suppliers have ignored to upload invoice details in their GSTR-1
  - Supplier entered wrong GSTIN of the buyer
  - Omission of entering any invoice by the buyer
  - Invoice No. & Date, Tax Amounts may have wrongly entered by the buyer in there books of account.
- The buyer can add, modify and delete the auto-populated information in GSTR-2. Such information is made available to supplier in GSTR-1A. The supplier can accept or reject the modifications made by the buyer and supplier’s GSTR-1 shall stand amended to the extent of modifications accepted.
- Buyer can avail credit with respect to invoice lines matched with the information in GSTR-2A. Though buyer can avail mismatched credit on a provisional basis, the same will get auto-reversed, if the supplier fails to upload invoices.
- To summarize, Reconciliation feature is required to:
  - Identify the purchase transactions, which are matched or unmatched with GSTR-2A. 
  - To ascertain the modifications required to be made in GSTR-2 and follow up the supplier to accept the same
  - Monitor unmatched transaction lines, if credit is availed on a provisional basis.
- Purchases as per the books of account of buyer shall be matched with the supplier-uploaded information in GSTR-2A,  every month before uploading GSTR-2 by the buyer.


## To set up GST component mapping reconciliation.

- Mapping GST reconciliation fields with GST components is a pre-requisite for GST Reconciliation. Unless it is done, reconciliation can not happen in the system.

   1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **GST Component Mapping Recon.**, and then choose the related link.
   2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.
    
        |Field|Description| 
        |---------------------------------|  ---------------------------------------| 
        |**GST Component Code**|Specifies the different components of GST.|
        |**GST Reconciliation Field No.**|Specifies the relevant reconciliation field against the component.|
        |**GST Reconciliation Field Name**|Specifies the description of the reconciliation field.|
        |**ISD Ledger Field No.**|Specifies the relevant input service distribution field against the component.|
        |**ISD Ledger Field Name**|Specifies the description of the input service distribution field.|

## GST reconciliation process

- Reconciliation feature enables the user to reconcile the posted purchase transactions with GSTR-2A downloaded from GSTN portal.

  1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **GST Reconciliation List.**, and then choose the related link, and click **New** to create a new reconciliation document.

  4. **Input Service Distributor** field will be marked true if the GSTIN is assigned for input service distribution location.
  5. Click on Action on the ribbon -> Functions -> Import GSTR-2A, choose the relevant file and the data will be updated in **Periodic GSTR-2A Data**.
  6. Click on **Fill GST Reconciliation** and the posted GST transactions will be populated in **GST Reconciliation Lines**.
 
- Purchase Transactions with Vendor Type – Unregistered, Imports and Composite are excluded from Reconciliation. [This is due to the reason that unregistered and import vendors are not registered with GSTN authorities and hence will not upload their supplies in GSTR-1. Hence the same are not reflected in GSTR-2]
- Invoice having multiple lines are clubbed together and shown as one line in GST Reconciliation feature i.e. Total Taxable amount and Tax Amounts (CGST, SGST, IGST).
- Periodic GSTR-2A can be downloaded in Excel or XML format. The following fields in GSTR-2A are matched with GST Reconciliation lines
   - External Document No.
   - Tax Amounts (IGST, CGST, SGST)
   - Vendor Invoice Date
   - GSTIN of the Supplier
   - Document Date
- GSTR-2A can be downloaded and reconciled with existing GST Reconciliation lines multiple times, but posting can be done only once in a month.
- For a given month, GST Reconciliation includes lines pertaining to purchase transactions (Registered Vendor including Reverse Charge) posted during the month and the lines, which are posted and unmatched during the previous months.
- GST Reconciliation lines shown in GST Reconciliation page are coming from following transactions:
    - Registered Vendor (Including Reverse Charge Posting Group)
    - Sub-Contracting Invoices (Registered Vendor)
    - Service Transfers 
    - Transfer Orders
- GST Reconciliation Lines shown in the selected month are having purchase transaction (Invoice & Credit Memo) till the End Date for selected month.

GST Reconciliation lines with status 'Reconciled' will not be considered again for reconciliation.

# Setting Up Subcontracting


Business Central has included **Subcontracting** Feature to Indian Localization.

Subcontracting process is very common in manufacturing organizations. Organizations adopt the job work process due to their capacity constraints, lack of resources or due to machine breakdowns. In Subcontracting, a delivery challan is used to send the raw items to the sub-contractor from the company. With some value addition by the sub-contractor, the finished items are sent back to the company.

While receiving the finished items in the company against a sub-contracting order, it is mandatory to apply received material against the delivery challan to knock off the raw items at sub-contractor end.

As far as the costing of finished item is concerned, it consists of raw material cost, sub-contracting cost along with the other charges such as freight etc. 

Raw items are taxable. Therefore, it is mandatory to follow the statutory requirement. As per this, the raw items sent to the sub contractor should return back within specified return period otherwise GST liability will be created. This feature enables you to create the GST liability and also lets you reverse the GST liability after receiving the raw items from sub- contractor

### Multiple subcontracting orders

Subcontracting feature also enables you to send the raw items to subcontracting vendor for multiple subcontracting orders against a single Delivery Challan. Delivery Challan will show the details of all subcontracting orders for which the raw material components have been sent to subcontracting vendor.

### Stock register for job work

Stock register for job work gives the details of delivery challan sent to the subcontractor. This register shows all the transaction against a delivery challan and at any movement it will also show the status of delivery challan along with GST liability if any.

# Cess Calculation


- GST Compensation Cess is leviable on both interstate and intrastate supply of goods. It is also applicable on imports and goods transactions which are subject to reverse charge.
- It is applicable only on notified goods. These goods as on date are pan masala, tobbaco and tobacco products, coal, aerated waters, motor cars & motor vehicles and any other supplies.
- GST Compensation Cess is calculated on taxable value. Though it is coined as Cess, it is similar to tax. It is independent of IGST, CGST and SGST.
- Input Tax Credit availed on GST Compensation Cess can be utilized only towards discharging Output tax liability of Compensation Cess and not otherwise.

## Calculation types of Cess

There are five different calculation types for cess calculation

- Cess %
- Threshold
- Cess % + Amount / Unit Factor
- Cess % Or Amount / Unit Factor Whichever Higher
- Amount / Unit Factor

## Method of calculation for type Cess%

If the Cess is applicable for any commodity, based on the GST group code then system will pick the Cess% defined on it.

In this scenario, invoice has been issued for INR 800 on which 18% IGST (9% CGST and 9% SGST/UTGST in case of Intra-State or Intra-Union Territory transaction or 18% IGST in case of Inter-State transaction), 10% Cess has to be charged.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:

    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|400|
    |**GST Base Amount**|800|  
    |**CGST**|72 (800*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|72 (800*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|144 (800*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|80 (800*10/100)|

## Method of calculation for type Threshold

For Threshold calculation type user will define **Threshold Amount**, **Before Threshold %** and **Cess %** (considered after crossing threshold amount). Note that Threshold amount defined in **GST CESS** setup for a particular GST Group Code will be applicable line wise.

Suppose, **Before Threshold %** is 2% and **Threshold Amount** is INR 1,000. An invoice has been issued for INR 800. In this scenario as the amount is less than the threshold amount, 2% Cess has to be charged.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|400|
    |**GST Base Amount**|800|  
    |**CGST**|72 (800*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|72 (800*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|144 (800*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|16 (800*2/100)|


Suppose, **Cess %** is 10% and **Threshold Amount** is INR 1,000. An invoice has been issued for INR 10000. In this scenario as the amount is greater than the threshold amount, 10% Cess has to be charged.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|5000|
    |**GST Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**CGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|1800 (10000*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|1000 (10000*10/100)|

## Method of calculation for type Cess% + Amount per Unit Factor

For component calculation type - ‘Cess % + Amount/Unit Factor’, system will consider ‘Cess %’ along with ‘Amount/Unit Factor’ defined on GST Setup fields i.e. **Cess UOM (Unit of Measure)**, **Cess Amount Per Unit Factor** and **Cess Factor Quantity**.

Suppose, **Cess %** is 10%, **Cess Amount per Unit Factor** is INR 130 and  **Cess Factor Quantity** is 1. An invoice has been issued for INR 10000. In this scenario 10% Cess and INR 260 has to be charged.



- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|5000|
    |**GST Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**CGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|1800 (10000*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|1260 [{1000=(10000*10/100)}+{260=(130x2)}]|

## Method of calculation for type Cess% Or Amount/Unit Factor Whichever Higher

For component calculation type - ‘Cess or Amount/Unit Factor whichever is higher’ system will consider ‘Cess %’ or ‘Amount/Unit Factor’ whichever is higher based on values defined on GST Setup fields i.e. **Cess UOM (Unit of Measure)**, **Cess Amount Per Unit Factor** and **Cess Factor Quantity**.

Suppose, **Cess %** is 10%, **Cess Amount per Unit Factor** is INR 130 and  **Cess Factor Quantity** is 1. An invoice has been issued for INR 10000. In this case cess amount will be INR 1000 which is higher than the quantity multiplied by the Cess Amount per Unit Factor, hence system will consider INR 1000 as Cess Amount.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|5000|
    |**GST Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**CGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|1800 (10000*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|1000 [{1000=(10000*10/100)} > {260=(130x2)}]|

Suppose, **Cess %** is 5%, **Cess Amount per Unit Factor** is INR 1000 and  **Cess Factor Quantity** is 1. An invoice has been issued for INR 10000. In this case the quantity multiplied by the Cess Amount per Unit Factor is INR 2000 which is higher than the rate defined in Cess%, hence system will consider INR 2000 as Cess Amount.

- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|5000|
    |**GST Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**CGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|1800 (10000*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|2000 [{2000=(1000x2)} > {500=(10000*5/100)}]|

## Method of calculation for type Amount/Unit Factor

For component calculation type as ‘Amount/Unit Factor’ system will consider Cess value based on values defined GST Group Code in fields **Cess UOM**, **Cess Amount Per Unit Factor** and **Cess Factor Quantity**.

Suppose, **Cess Amount per Unit Factor** is INR 140 and  **Cess Factor Quantity** is 1. An invoice has been issued for INR 10000. In this scenario INR 280 has to be charged.


- GST calculation will appear in the Fact Box, as following:
    
    |Component|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Quantity**|2|
    |**Unit Amount**|5000|
    |**GST Base Amount**|10000|  
    |**CGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|  
    |**SGST**|900 (10000*9/100)|
    |**IGST**|1800 (10000*18/100)|
    |**CESS**|280 (140x2)|

# TDS with Threshold



This topic explains the requirement of threshold amount in TDS and  the process of calculating TDS for such transactions.

## TDS calculation considering threshold limits

TDS Threshold defines the threshold limit for each TDS Section.  TDS can be deducted only if the total transaction with the assessee exceeds the threshold limit in the financial year.

In a scenario where, credit or payment to a contractor under TDS Section 194C is below TDS threshold limit of INR 1,00,000 in aggregate in a financial year and single transaction threshold limit INR 30,000, TDS will not be deducted. 

In the example given below, four transactions of INR 29,000 took place in a financial year, on the fourth transaction TDS will be deducted as the aggregate (previous transactions) credit or payment amount exceeds the TDS threshold limit of INR 1,00,000. TDS Calculation as following:

   |Particulars|Amount Credited or Paid|TDS Rates|TDS Amount|Threshold Limit|
   |--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------|-------|  
   |First Invoice|29000|2%|Zero|Less than Single Transaction Threshold Limit 30,000|
   |Second Invoice|29000|2%|Zero|Less than Single Transaction Threshold Limit 30,000|
   |Third Invoice|29000|2%|Zero|Less than Single Transaction Threshold Limit 30,000|
   |Forth Invoice|20000|2%|2,140 (2% of 1,07,000 i.e. total of all invoices)|Exceeds TDS Threshold Limit 1,00,000|

1. GL Entries for TDS where payment is less than threshold limits (first transaction where vendor has given the invoice for INR 29,000), will be as following:
    
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchases Account**|29000| 
    |**Vendor Account**|-29000|

2. GL Entries for TDS where payment is less than threshold limits (second transaction where vendor has given the invoice for INR 29,000), will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchases Account**|29000|  
    |**Vendor Account**|-29000|

3. GL Entries for TDS where payment is less than threshold limits (third transaction where vendor has given the invoice for INR 29,000), will be as following:
 
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchases Account**|29000|  
    |**Vendor Account**|-29000|

4. GL Entries for TDS where payment is more than (exceeding) Threshold limits (forth transaction where vendor has given the invoice for INR 20,000), will be as following:
    
    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchases Account**|29000| 
    |**TDS Payable Account**|2140| 
    |**Vendor Account**|-29000|

# Purchase Return of Goods and Services to Composite Vendor or Purchase Return of Exempted Goods and Services with no GST Impact


A composite vendor is a vendor whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed fifty lakh rupees and has opted for composition scheme. A composite vendor neither collects tax from the recipient of supplies nor passes on any credit of Input Tax. Hence, no GST is computed if the purchases are made from a composite vendor. 

A composite vendor has to register himself with the GST authorities and hence registration no. is mandatory on the vendor card, if the vendor Type is selected as Composite. State Code is also mandatory. No GST entries are generated for a composite vendor, as a composite vendor is not entitled to collect any tax from the customers. 

A buyer may have to return the goods or issue credit note due to various reasons like damaged goods, quality issues etc.

Process for purchase returns to a composite vendor has been explained in this document.


## Create a purchase return order or credit memo

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](image/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Return Order or Credit Memo**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **Vendor** on **Purchase Credit Memo** header, GST vendor type should be **Composite** or **Exempted**.
3. Select **Item Code** for goods, **G/L Account** for Service purchase, **Fixed Asset** for Fixed Asset purchase and **Charge (Item)** for Item Charge on **Purchase Credit Memo** line. 

For example, Purchase Return Order or Credit Memo has been issued for INR 10000 on which no GST is charged.

- GL Entries will be as following:

    |Particulars|Amount|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Vendor Account**|10000|
    |**Purchase or Services or Fixed Asset increase during the year Account**|-10000|

# Work with carbon credit  

When companies can't reduce their emissions for various reasons, they can purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. By buying carbon credits, a company can still emit the equivalent amount of gases while remaining carbon neutral. These credits are purchased from specialized providers, incentivizing emission reductions.  

In general, carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or other greenhouse gases (GHGs). One carbon credit typically represents the right to emit one metric ton of CO₂ or an equivalent amount of another GHG, so it's important to enable this option for some organizations.  

## Set up the carbon credit  

Carbon Credit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set as the **Item**. To set up the **Item** as a carbon credit, follow the steps:
  
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link. 
2. [Create new item as explained](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).   
3. Once the item is created, select the **GHG Credit** field on the **Sustainability** FastTab and add the value of carbon credit using the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field.

> [!NOTE]
> **Carbon Credit Per UOM** represents the amount of CO₂ in the unit of measure configured in the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** in the **Sustainability Setup**. So, this means the total value of carbon credit is the amount of credited CO₂ per one **Base Unit of Measure** of used item.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up any type of item, whether it's inventory, service, or non-inventory, as a carbon credit.  

## To purchase carbon credit 

### Purchase documents 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow the steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   1. Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   2. Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.   
2. Populate the document header based on the following instruction [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). 
3. Choose the item configured as a carbon credit in the **No.** field in the purchase document lines, and add appropriate **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost**. 
4. Add the **Sustainability Account No.** you would use for decreasing your carbon dioxide (CO₂) value. The system will automatically populate the value in the **Emission CO2** field based on the value you have configured in the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field on the **Item** card.
5. Post the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Although carbon credit will decrease the value of entries, you'll see a positive amount of value in the **Emission CO2**. But once you post the document, you'll see a value with a negative sign in the **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **GHG Credit** as a **Document Type**.  

### Sustainability journals 

To work with **Sustainability Journal** follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you intend to post in the same batch.  
3. Choose the **GHG Credit** in the **Document Type** field.    
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only non-blocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory. Choose the appropriate account to post-carbon credits.
5. Select **Manual Input** and enter the value you want to post as a carbon credit to the **Emission CO2** field.  
6. Post the journal.

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased, then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the involved transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. You can also not correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with with receipts from more than one purchase order. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items.

The change might relate to all the products on the original purchase invoice or only to some of the products. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or demand partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents, for example another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

## Inventory costing
To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** function in the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it will be applied to the specified posted purchase documents.

    When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you have already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
    >
    >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1.  On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items from your vendor that aren't what you wanted, for example, if they're slightly damaged, the wrong color or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following describes it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, then you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** function.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they have been posted as shipped.     

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** function again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Location
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as am item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_reservations.png" alt-text="Planning with reservations.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The planning system may have consumed the safety stock intentionally and will then replenish it straight away. Learn more at [Consume safety stock](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#consume-safety-stock).

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_error_log.png" alt-text="Error messages in the planning worksheet.":::

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Electronic invoicing in Germany

This article provides information on how to work with the German localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

Learn more in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md), which provides information about setting up the E-Documents framework.

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the E-Document framework for the German localization supports the XRechnung (UBL) and Peppol BIS 3 formats. The ZUGFeRD format isn't supported yet.

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PEPPOL BIS 3.0** or **XRechnung**.  
1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

# Export and Print Intrastat Reports

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat funcionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. To learn more about the updated version of Intrastat, go to [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md).

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# Declare VAT-VIES Tax in the German Version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **EC Sales List** report and t, which you can use to submit information about sales transactions with other European Union (EU) countries/regions to the customs and tax authorities' list system. The report displays information in the same format that is used in the customs and tax authorities' declaration list.  

Depending on the volume of sales of goods or services to other EU countries/regions, you must submit monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly declarations. If your company has sales of more than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a monthly declaration. If your company has sales of less than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a quarterly declaration. For more information, see the [BZSt website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204368).  

The report is based on the VAT Entry table.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

    |**Export Table Name**|Optional. An archive file with the necessary data is created, containing an *INDEX.XML* file. You can change the suggested name of the table to be used in the `INDEX.XML` file during the export. The default name is the name of the table without special characters due to the requirements of the auditors' tool.<br><br/> **Tip:** In most cases, the **Export Table Name** and **Export File Name** fields are based on the same value.<br><br/> There may be cases where you specify exporting the same table more than once. You can choose different Export Table Names for each table entry, and the Export File Name is automatically adjusted to match. You can then change the Export File Name as long as it's unique.<br><br/> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically names the files as follows.<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name**: GLAccount<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount.txt<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name:** GLAccount1<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount1.txt|  
    |**Period Field No.**|Specify a filter for which date field is used in setting the start date and end date of the report.<br><br/> For example, if you select the **G/L Entry** table as your data export source, you can select one of the date fields that are available in that table.|

    |**Date Filter Field No.**|Specify a date filter field if the table has one.<br><br/> If the table has more than one date filter, don't specify one in this field.|  
    |**Date Filter Handing**|Specify how the date filter is to be handled:<br><br/> - \<blank\>: No filter is set.<br><br/> - Period: Use the specified Start Date and End Date.<br><br/> - End Date Only: Use the batch job's End Date.<br><br/> - Start Date Only: Use the batch job's Start Date - 1.|  
    |**Export File Name**|Specify the name of the file that data from this table is exported to.<br><br/> For example, if the table is the **G/L Account** table, the value of the **Export Table Name** can be **GLAccount**, and the value of the **Export File Name** field can be **GLAccount.txt**.|  
    |**Key No.**|Optional. Specify the key field.|

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The INDEX.XML file contains table and field names in English based on the names of tables and fields. The names of tables and fields are defined in `<Name>` tags, and captions are defined in `<Description>` tags in the *INDEX.xml* file.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Print general ledger setup information in the German version

Before you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in the daily business, you can run the **G/L Setup Information** report to display the master data that you set up. For example, you can look over this master data, so that you would have a baseline to compare to, and then verify that you set up posting groups correctly.  

## Procedure to print

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Setup Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Setup Information** field, select the master data area as described in the following table.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**G/L Setup - Company Data - Consolidation**|Displays tables for general ledger setup, company information, and business units.|  
    |**Posting Groups**|Displays customer posting group tables, vendor posting group tables, inventory posting group tables, and bank account posting group tables.|  
    |**Posting Matrix**|Displays general business posting group tables, general product posting group tables, and general posting group tables.|  
    |**VAT Setup**|Displays VAT business posting group tables, VAT product posting group tables, and VAT posting setup tables.|

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|  
    |**Take Payment Discounts**|Select if you want the batch job to include customer ledger entries for which you can receive a payment discount.|  
    |**Payment Discount Date**|Enter the date that is used to calculate the payment discount.|  
    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

When the batch job is finished, the domiciliation journal contains all open customer ledger entries that match the filters.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  

### Edit a journal line  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.

1. Select the journal line, and then choose the **Delete** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.

1. Choose the **Test Report** action.  
1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## Export and Post Domiciliation

You can submit domiciliation to your bank by exporting the data to a file. When you export to a file, you can choose to automatically post the lines to the general ledger.  

Depending on setup of the **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page, the **File Domiciliations** action opens either of these request pages:  

- **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** page – for the SEPA Direct Debit format.  
- **File Domiciliations** page – for domestic formats.  

### Export and post domiciliation

1. Choose an appropriate location from where you upload the file to your bank, and then choose **Save**.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button to automatically post the domiciliation journal lines.  

   If you didn't select the **Post General Journal Lines** checkbox, you must post the domiciliation manually in the general journal.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After posting domiciliation in the general journal, delete the posted domiciliation on the **Domiciliation Journal** page. To do this, select all lines with status **Posted**, and then choose the **Delete** action.

# Manually transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you applied and processed all CODA statement lines, you can manually transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal. The financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference between the two balances. Posting isn't allowed if the statement line amounts don't balance with the statement ending balance. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-automatically-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

# Automatically transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you apply and processed all CODA statement lines, you can transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines, you can post the lines in a corresponding general journal. If no such general journal exists, you can't transfer the lines. You can create a journal to handle CODA statements. Learn more in [Create Financial Journals](how-to-create-financial-journals.md).  

Alternatively, you can manually transfer and post CODA statements. Learn more in [Manually Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Automatically transfer statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Transfer to General Ledger** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.  

The batch job now transfers the CODA statement lines to the financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines to the journal, you can post the statement lines in the corresponding financial journal.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions.

This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all purchase documents.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Enter and Post Cash and Bank/Giro Journals
The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## To post cash journals  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Date**|The journal entry date.|

    |**Description**|The description of the entry. This field automatically populates the description of the account number selected in the **Account No.** field.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code used to post the entry. You can select a code in this field only if the **Account Type** is **G/L Account**. For more information, see VAT Product Posting Groups.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br /><br /> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** check box.|  

4.  Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If there is a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

     The entries are posted to the general ledger. For more information, see General Ledger Entries.  

## To post bank or giro journals  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank/Giro Journal**, and then choose the related link.

    |**Account No.**|The account number to which the journal entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Identification**|The identification number that links the statement line to a payment history line.|  
    |**Description**|The description of the entry.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code that will be used when you post the entry on the statement line.|

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for each category and subcategory combination. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Category**|Specify the main category option for the VAT statement.|  
    |**By Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can now map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version
Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases are not included in this declaration. <br /><br />
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it is required that the merchandise have crossed the border physically. It is not enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. For more information, see the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  

- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. For more information, see [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## To prepare for electronic declaration
Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. A list of certificate providers can be found here: [https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  

    - Register a user of Digipoort, which can be done here: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).

    - Obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, which can be obtained at the Dutch Tax Administration website: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

2. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. For more information, see [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

3. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. For more information, see [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## To create an electronic declaration
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## To submit an electronic declaration
With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

3. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message will be displayed.

## To import a response message from the tax authorities
For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To process a response message from the tax authorities
When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data has been processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The processed information about the response message is displayed in the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

4. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT

# Import and reconcile bank statements
Banks provide electronic bank statements for all your financial interactions. You can import these statements into the bank or giro journals.  

The import bank statement is supported by the following protocols:  

- Rabobank mut.asc  
- Rabobank vvmut.ac  
- Rabobank ASCII

3.  To reconcile the bank statements automatically when importing, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Automatic Reconciliation** check box.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This function does not work for bank statement files of type SEPA CAMT. Instead, use the **Match Automatically** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](../../bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  

4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
5.  To import the file that contains the electronic bank statement, specify the file name and path, and then choose the **Open** button.

# Docket Reports in the Dutch Version
The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount will be paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system will select the **Docket** check box on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  

- The payment is not based upon an invoice.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.
