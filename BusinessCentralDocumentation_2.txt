# Synchronize contacts in Business Central with contacts in Microsoft Outlook

You can set up contact synchronization so that your contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have the same information as your contacts in Microsoft Outlook. For example, if you're a sales person, you might work in Outlook and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the same time. If the contacts are the same in both places, your work is more straightforward.  

By default, the contacts you're syncing are kept in a **Business Central** folder in your Favorites on the Folder Pane in Outlook. The Business Central folder can make it easier to identify which contacts you're syncing. You can set filters to sync only specific contacts from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Outlook. After you set up synchronization, you can synchronize manually or automate the process to synchronize on a scheduled basis.  

## Prerequisites

- Your user account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must specify your Microsoft 365 email account.

  You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365** section of your **User Card**, which you open from the **Users** list.
- With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you set up contact synchronization as described in [Set Up contact synchronization with Outlook for Business Central on-premises](admin-contact-sync-setup-onprem.md).

## Set up synchronization

You set up how you want to synchronize contacts with Outlook on the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

On the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can validate that the connection to Exchange is working and then set up contact synchronization. From the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can open the **Contact Sync. Setup** page and start the synchronization. Optionally, set a filter to specify which contacts to synchronize. For example, you can filter on name, type, company, and so on. You can also change the default name of the folder in Outlook that the contacts synchronize to.  

Each of your coworkers can also set up their own Exchange synchronization and set their own filters on which contacts to synchronize.  

After you set up synchronization, sync changes manually. Business Central versions 2023 release wave 2 and earlier support automated synchronization. Learn more about automation in the next section of this article.

## Synchronize contacts

To sync contacts, select one of these actions on the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page:

- **Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all changes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Microsoft 365 that were made after the last synchronization, based on the last modified date. Also, new contacts from Microsoft 365 are synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Typically, this action is faster than a full sync. 

- **Full Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all contacts in both directions, regardless of the last sync date and last modified date.  

In both cases, contacts are only synchronized from Outlook if they have the required fields filled in. The required fields to synchronize to Microsoft 365 are **Name**, **Email address** and the contact must be of the type **Person**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is the source of the contact information, so the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact information is saved if there are duplicates.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a contact in Outlook, but keep it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact will be recreated in Outlook the next time you sync.

### Automate synchronization (background synchronization)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in 2024 release wave 1 (version 24), you can't turn on background synchronization anymore. If it's currently on, it works as expected. If you turn it off, you can't turn it on again.

To automate sync, if the **Enable Background Synchronization** toggle is on, create a job queue entry to sync contacts on a schedule you set. Learn more in [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

The following table lists the settings on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page for syncing contacts:

|Field|Setting for contact sync|
|-----|-----|
|Object Type to Run|Codeunit|
|Object ID to Run|6700|

# Create bins

The most effective way to create the bins of your warehouse is to generate groups of similar bins in the bin creation worksheet, but you can also create your bins individually from the location card. You can also use a function on the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page to create bins automatically.  

## To create a bin from the location card

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### The dedicated field

The **Dedicated** field on the **Bins** page specifies that quantities in the bin are protected from being picked for other demands. However, quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

Making a bin dedicated results in similar functionality in basic warehousing to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

### Example

A work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code.

> [!Caution]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production or assembly components with the **Inventory Pick** page. For more information, see [Pick for Production or Assembly in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

## To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you're creating.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bins** action.  

## To make bins automatically in the bin creation worksheet

Before you start creating bins automatically, you should determine the kind of bins that are essential for your operations, and the most practical flow of items through the physical structure of your warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As soon as you use a bin, you cannot delete it unless it is empty. But if you want to use another bin-naming system, you can use the reclassification journal to in effect move your items to a new bin system. This process is manual and takes time, however, so it is best to set up your bins correctly from the start.  

To work with the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page, you must be set up as a warehouse employee at the location where the bins exist. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).    

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Bins** action.
3. On the **Calculate Bins** page, in the **Bin Template Code** field, select the bin template that you want to use as the model for the bins you're creating.
4.  Fill in a description for the bins you are in the process of creating.  
5.  To create the bin codes, fill in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields in the three categories shown on the page: **Rack**, **Section,**, and **Level.** The bin code can contain up to 20 characters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The number of characters that you have entered in the three categories for either field, for example, the characters you have entered in the three **From No.** fields, plus the field separators, if any, must be 20 or less.  

     You can use letters in the code as an identifying combination, but the letter you use must be the same in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields. For example, you might define the Rack part of the code as **From No. A01** and **To No. A10**. The application isn't set up to generate codes with letter sequences, for example, from A01 to F05.  

6.  If you want a character, such as a hyphen, to separate the category fields you have defined as part of the bin code, fill in the **Field Separator** field with this character.  
7.  If you want application not to create a line for a bin if it exists already, select the **Check on Existing Bin** field.  
8. When you finish filling in the fields, choose the **OK** button.

    The application creates a line for each bin in the worksheet. You can now delete some of the bins, for example, if you have a rack with a passageway through the first two levels of a couple of sections.  

9. When you delete all unnecessary bins, choose the **Create Bins** action, and application creates bins for each line in the worksheet.  

Repeat the process for another set of bins until you create all the bins in your warehouse.

# Payment practices report  

Authorities in some country/regions require large companies to report their payment practices and performance regarding how quickly they pay their vendors. For example, each year Swedish companies with 250 or more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office the payment times they have for purchases from smaller companies. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The legislation is intended to protect smaller businesses from bearing financial burdens that late payments cause.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries currently require this type of reporting. Because the requirements are largely the same, this is a global feature that all countries/regions can use.  

You can base the report on different sources, and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms. Companies can provide reports for vendors for the following information, as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.
- The percentage of invoices they paid within the agreed payment period.

You can select the period for which to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries.

## Generate the report

To run the **Payment Practices** report, use the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that op the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Practices**, and then select the related link. 
2. Select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter values in the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|-----------------------------------|
   | No. | Specify the number of the entry or record for the report. |
   | Aggregation Type | Specify how data is aggregated. If you choose **Period**, the report is covers the period defined in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. If you choose **Company Size**, the report is based on the number of employees in the vendor company. **Note:** To use the **Company Size** option, you must first create sizes in the **Company Sizes** page and assign them to the relevant vendors in the **Company Size Code** field on the **Vendor Card** page.  |
   | Header Type | Specifies the source for entries in the payment practice, and you can choose Vendors, Customers or both. |
   | Starting Date | Specifies the starting date of the payment practice. |
   | Ending Date | Specifies the ending date of the payment practice. |

4. After you fill in the fields in the header, use the **Generate** action to generate the report data.

When you generate the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Generated On** and **Generated By** fields with the date and time it was generated and by whom, respectively.

## Edit the results

Based on the selection in the **Aggregation Type** field, you get different lines. You can change the values on the lines. If you do, the report is marked as **Modified Manually**.

## Review the calculations

To explore the calculations behind the values on the **Statistics** FastTab, choose the value in the field to open the **Payment Practice Data List** page.

## Print the report

To print the document, choose the **Print** action.

# Procurement Quick Start

To be able to buy products and services, you must first set up vendors. Once that is done, you can start registering purchase orders and receiving invoices.  

## Set up vendors

The following video shows you how to set up a vendor in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

### Set up a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when you register vendors, see [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  

## Create new purchase orders

When you buy something from a vendor you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a purchase invoice. However, you must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity was not available at the vendor.

The following video shows you how to create a purchase order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=f04b1ed3-5cb0-4fa8-8cd0-24069ee893d2]

### To create a purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Order.

3. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Header** are now filled with the standard information about the selected vendor.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase order lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Order Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the order.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase order, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md).  

## Create a purchase invoice  

You create a purchase invoice to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Creating a purchase invoice is similar to creating a purchase order.

### How to create and post a purchase invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Invoice** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Invoice.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected vendor.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase invoice, see [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [General](#tab/general)

### How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you use it, when you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat, or choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you might have to enter the credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

To sign out of the identity in Teams you used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, then choose **Settings**. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**.

### Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;such as on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. To search for contacts in a different company, go to [Settings](across-teams-settings.md). When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record to the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organization and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace.

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app works with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether offered by Microsoft or a partner.  Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (learn more in [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with industry solutions?

Yes. But only some features of the app work with Embed apps:

- The app works with links based on the **\*.bc.dynamics.com** pattern that's typically used with Embed apps.
- Contact search isn't available for Embed apps that replace the base application from Microsoft.

Learn more about emdeb apps in [Embed apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview).

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can only view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. You can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages or searching for contacts. Learn more about minimum requirements for mobile in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android?

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaboration within Teams. Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. Learn more about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps in:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams Mobile App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) in Microsoft Support

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On those platforms, use a supported browser to access Teams.

Learn more about minimum requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

Learn more about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them at [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that might affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app.
- Phone numbers can't be activated from the details window in Teams for iOS, Android, or in the browser.
- Using Microsoft Edge with Teams in the browser lets you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. Learn more about using profiles in Microsoft Edge at [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) in Microsoft Support.

### What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organization, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organization that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater to my customization and personalization?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables from your own custom extensions or AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customizations installed for your organization. Cards don't consider any role-specific customizations or user personalization. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including extensions, role customizations, and user personalization.

When you search for contacts, the fields matched in the **Contacts** table and fields shown in the search results aren't affected by any customization or personalization.

### How do the permissions required by the app affect my privacy?

Before installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can review the minimum permissions required for the app to function. By installing the app, you give the app permission to receive the messages and data you provide to it and you give Teams permission to store and process those messages.

Also, some [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features require opening external links or access to your camera or geographic location. So suppose you wanted to capture a photo of a purchase invoice for processing. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't use these capabilities without your consent and they're only used by specific features in the **Details** window. When you use one of these features for the first time, Teams displays a dialog box asking you to grant access to the required device capabilities.

- In Teams desktop, you review and adjust app permissions from the **Settings** window. Select your profile picture at the top of the app, select **Settings** > **Permissions**, then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

- For Teams in the browser and Teams for iOS or Android, you can review or adjust permissions from your browser or device settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Exactly which [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features prompt you for permissions depends on the add-on apps and customizations applied to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you connect to.

### Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organization handles the privacy of your data.

### How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon, and select **Uninstall**.  

### Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/).

If you want to participate in improving the app for Teams, or have an idea that would help simplify your work or collaborative experiences in Teams, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

### Where can I find Teams integration inside the Business Central web client? 

To learn about the functionality in the web client that links to Teams, see [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

## [Business Central Tabs](#tab/tabs)

### <a name="who-can-view"></a>Who can see the content of a tab?

Any person in your chat or channel who has:

1. The Business Central app for Teams installed.
2. Either a Business Central license or has been granted access to Business Central using their Microsoft 365 license.
3. Permissions to view the data on the page.

### <a name=#recommended-content></a>Where does the recommended content come from?

The recommended content that you can choose from in the **Tab content** option on a tab is based on your Role Center. The recommend content only includes list pages, like Customers, Sales Orders, and Vendors - not individuals card page alike a specific customer or vendor.

Specifically, the recommended content includes:

- Actions in the top navigation menu of the role center
- Any list pages you've bookmarked.
- If a list page offers different views, including any views you created, you also get to choose from those views

You can add list pages to the recommended content by adding bookmarks. You can also remove recommended content by deleting bookmarks. Learn more in [Bookmark a Page or Report on Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

If you switch the environment or company on the tab option, the recommended content will changed based on the Role Center and bookmarks for the environment and company you switch to.

### When I create a tab, does it grant permissions to the people in the channel or chat?

No. Creating tabs doesn't affect permissions, and users must already have permission to that data when they access the tab.

### Can I chat alongside a tab?

Yes. Use the chat icon to start the conversation. This chat thread is then associated with the tab. 

### If I remove a tab from a chat or channel, is any Business Central data deleted?

No.

### Can I safely rename a tab?

Yes. The contents of the tab are unrelated to the actual name of the tab. Rename at will! 

### I need to work across tasks in different windows. Can I do this?

Yes. You can pop out the tab to its own browser window to show the Business Central web client. 

### Can I add or pin tab in Team meetings?

No. The Business Central app for Teams doesn't support tabs in meetings.

### Can't add a tab if using ISV Urls like *.bc.dynamics.com (but can pin)

Not supported.

### When I do things in the tab, like navigate, resort, apply a filter, or search, do others see my changes?

No. Only field changes or running actions affect how others see the contents of the tab.

### Does the tab content refresh automatically? If not, how do I refresh it?

The content doesn't refresh automatically, and these currently no refresh button. The best way to refresh the content to make sure it's up to data, leave the tab and then come back. 

### Does this show lists and records from my customizations and add-ons?

Yes. 

### When I add a tab, will people see it in my language?

No. Each user views the tab contents in the language, region, and timezone settings from Business Central. 

### Can I have multiple tabs pointing to different content?

Yes.

### Can I also add tabs to chat with a single person?

Yes, as long as the chat isn't a draft (that is, a message hasn't been sent to initiate that chat) and the other person has the Business Central app installed too.

### Can I switch companies within a tab?

No.

### Is this different than using Teams' generic ability to create a tab that hosts a website?

Yes. We don't recommend that you use approach. In many cases, it doesn't work for Business Central.

## [Search for Contacts](#tab/contacts)

### Which tables does the app search in?

When searching for contacts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, your search terms are matched against records in the **Contacts** table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### Which fields in the contacts table can I search?

As you type your search terms in the search box, the terms are matched against most fields in the **Contacts** table. The fields include, for example, the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **Phone No.** or **Mobile Phone No.**, and **Email** fields. 

Search terms aren't matched against any custom fields added to the **Contacts** table by apps and extensions.

### Do search results include companies and persons?

Yes. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], contacts can be of type **Company** or type **Person**, where one or more persons can be associated with a company. In the search results, companies and persons have different icons.

### Do contacts of any business relationship appear in the results?

Yes. Some contacts can represent customers or vendors, or both. Other contacts with no defined business relation typically represent prospective customers. Contacts with other business relations, including any custom relations you've configured in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], will also be displayed in the search results.

### Can I look up contact details during meetings?

Yes. You can look up contact information, history of interaction, and related documents for your customer or vendor during a Teams meeting or call while the meeting is happening, without leaving Teams.

In fact, you can look up contact details from anywhere in Teams by using the **Search** box. You can, for example, look up contact details from the Teams calendar to help you set up meetings.

### How do I view my last interactions with a contact?

The details window for a contact displays interaction log entries. The interaction log entries provide the history of interactions that your organization has had with the specific contact. The interactions can include emails you've exchanged, calls you've received, or documents you've sent.

For interactions to be displayed, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] must be configured to track interactions. To learn more about logging interactions, see [Record Interactions With Contacts](marketing-interactions.md).

### How do I register a Teams call or meeting as an interaction?

From the details window for a contact, find the **Create Interaction** action, and choose from the incoming or outgoing calls as interaction templates. You can also create your own custom interaction templates specifically for use with Teams conversations.

### Can I call a contact from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] has limited integration to Teams calling capabilities. It isn't possible to instantly start a VOIP call from the contact card or contact details window. However, when you view the contact details in the Teams desktop app, you can select the phone number field to dial that number if Teams is set up as your default dialing app on your device. To dial landlines or mobile phone numbers using PSTN, the traditional phone system, Teams requires that you have the Microsoft 365 Business Voice app. To learn more, see [What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?](/MicrosoftTeams/business-voice/whats-business-voice).

### How do I view recent documents for a customer or vendor?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] typically relates a contact with a customer or vendor record that in turn is related to business transaction records, such as sales quotes or purchase invoices. To view related documents for a contact, go to the details window for the contact, select the **Business Relation** field value or use the actions to navigate to the associated customer or vendor. On the customer or vendor page, expand the FactBox pane to reveal statistics for various documents that you can drill down into. Your experience can differ based on your customizations and personalization.

### How do I search for contacts using special characters?

You can enter search criteria using almost any unicode characters. However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves the following symbols for other uses: **=**, **.**, **\***, and **@**. Using these symbols in your search terms might not return the expected results. If you don't see the expected results, enclose the symbols in your search terms in single quotes, for example, **Contoso'='2**.

### How can I search contacts stored in a different company?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can search for customers, vendors, and other contacts in one company at a time.  
To search for contacts stored in a different [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, open [Settings](across-teams-settings.md), then change the environment and company from there.

### Are [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts different than the ones in the Teams contacts screen?

Yes. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] represent business contacts available to your organization. They're contacts with which you have an established and well-defined business relationship, or contacts that represent prospective customers. These contacts are typically external contacts. In comparison, the contacts shown in the Teams Calling contacts list are your own contacts. These contacts aren't necessarily shared with others in your organization, and they typically represent contacts internal to your organization.

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize contacts with Teams?

No. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] remain separate from your contacts stored in Teams. There are currently no plans to synchronize the two lists together. When you use the Teams feature **Share someone's contact info** from the chat compose box, it has no relation to Business Central contacts.

### Can I search from my mobile device?

Contact search isn't available from Teams for iOS and Teams for Android at this time.

### Which permissions do I need for contact search?

To search for contacts, you need object-level permission to the **Contacts** table within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company being searched. To view the details window for a contact, you need at least read permission to the **Contact** page within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, and any other related objects.

### Can I use contact search if I'm a delegated admin?

Yes. You can also look up contacts and contact details if you have a delegated admin role in an organization.

### Is contact search affected by API limits?

Yes. Searching for contacts from Teams is based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] v2.0 APIs and subject to any API limits that manage usage. Learn more about the limits in [Current API Limits](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-current-limits).

### Why does it sometimes ask me to set up the app?

After you sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams for the first time, the app will attempt to determine your preferred company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the app can't determine the company, you might have to go to the **Settings** and choose the company you wish to search in. This situation happens, for example, if you have access to multiple companies across environments in your organization. In this case, you'll have to choose a company before you can start searching.  

The app can also ask you to visit the **Settings** if you don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription, there are no [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, or your account doesn't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### I'd like to search for items or records from other tables. Can I do this from Teams?

Searching in other tables isn't possible at this time. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams searches only in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts list, which can include vendors, customers, and other contacts.

If you'd like to see the search capabilities evolve to include other tables, we encourage our community to add an idea or vote for existing ideas at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas.

## [Work with cards](#tab/cards)

### Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Zip codes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I delete a card I sent to a chat?

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator might have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### Why don't cards show more information instead of just the page name and details button?

An administrator might have configured the Teams integration so that cards don't show data about records. For more information, see [Show or hide record data on cards](admin-teams-integration.md#show-or-hide-record-data-on-cards).

### Will others see my card if they don't have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card&mdash;even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

### How do I find out which company a card in Teams belongs to?

If you work across [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, talk to your administrator about enabling a company badge for each company. When enabled, this eye-catching hint appears in any details window inside Teams, and displays the company and environment that record belongs to. To learn how to set up company badge, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).

## [Work with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### Where is the save button in the details window in Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialog within the details window, you might need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window?

No. While everyone in the chat or meeting can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams?

Yes. If you're using the Teams desktop app, start a call by choosing the linked number in a phone number field, like the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones, Teams requires that you have a Business Voice license for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### Can I print documents from the details window in Teams?

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams?

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you're using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app.

### How do I open the details in a new window?

Popping out the details window as a separate window is useful for multi-tasking or for being able to work with business data while still being able to use Teams chat and other Teams functions. To open details in its own window, choose **Open in browser** from the ellipse menu (**...**) in the upper right corner of the window.

## [Collaborate with guests](#tab/collaborating)

### Can I share cards with users outside my organization?

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organization. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organization to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organization. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details page if they have permission to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license within your organization.

Choosing the details link on any Business Central card will sign you in to the environment from which the card was shared, assuming you have permission to the environment.

Guest users aren't allowed to use contact search because it's bound to the original tenant and we don't currently support such a delegated scenario.

When a guest composes a message, links to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] or yours won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, go to [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organization's policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organization. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [Share to Teams](#tab/share)

### Does Share to Teams send a compact card? 

Yes. The link will automatically expand into a card if you have the Business Central app for Teams installed. 

### Will recipients receive the message from me or from a Business Central service account? 

When you use Share to Teams, the message is sent to a person, group, or channel, similar to if you had sent the message yourself from within Microsoft Teams. Recipients see the message from you on their preferred Teams client, and can react and respond as they normally would to a message from you. 

### Is Share to Teams available in Business Central on premises? 

No. Similar to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, this feature is only available for the web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does Share to Teams grant permissions to recipients? 

No. When you share with a person, group, or channel, permissions are unaffected. Users who already have permission to view the page and data targeted by the link can do so. Users who don't have permission to view that page and data, or don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license, are shown an error message. 
 
### Must I have the Teams desktop app installed to use Share to Teams? 

No. All you need is a valid account that has access to Microsoft Teams. 

### Is Share to Teams available in all Business Central clients? 

At this time, Share to Teams is available in the desktop web client, in the details window in Teams, and when opening a page in a new window from the Outlook add-in.

### Where do I find Share to Teams in Business Central? 

The **Share to Teams action** can be found in the **Share** menu on all pages, such as card and document pages, list or worksheet pages, including custom pages. The action isn't available on dialog boxes or pages shown as dialog boxes, such as lookup pages or wizards.

# Troubleshoot Copilot and agent capabilities

Copilot is an AI-powered functionality in Business Central that assists in various tasks like drafting marketing text and reconciling bank accounts. If you're experiencing trouble with Copilot or other agent capabilities, this article can help you identify and fix common issues.

## Copilot doesn't appear on pages

If Copilot functionality, such as the **Draft with Copilot** action for marketing text suggestions or the **Reconcile with Copilot** action for bank account reconciliation assist, doesn't appear on a page as expected, check the following:

- Make sure that the feature is enabled if it's controlled under Feature Management. [Learn more about feature management](admin-feature-management.md).

- Make sure that the functionality isn't hidden by personalization. [Learn more about personalization](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Copilot appears on pages, but you get an error that it's not activated

When you try to use Copilot and you get an error similar to **Sorry, Copilot is not activated for \[feature\]**, there are a couple things to check:

- First, make sure that the feature is activated on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about activating Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features). 
- Next, make sure that privacy notice statement for Azure OpenAI integration isn't set to **Disagree for everyone**. If it is, change it to **Agree for everyone**. [Learn more about privacy notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Copilot capabilities from Microsoft not listed on Copilot & agent capabilities page

If none of the AI features from Microsoft are shown in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, it's likely because you have one or more embed apps installed on your environment. Embed apps can offer their own Copilot capabilities, but capabilities published by Microsoft aren't compatible with environments having embed apps.

# Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse
1. Open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, and then turn off the **Enabled** toggle. Then close the page to disconnect from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, and in the **Ownership Model** field, choose **Person**. Then choose the **Enabled** toggle to turn on the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to Dataverse.
4. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** to reinstall the Business Central Integration Solution.
5. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to reconnect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This enables integration with tables that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as sales orders, quotes, and invoices.
6. On the **Sales Connection Setup** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup** to initialize the integration table mappings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Using the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action will apply the default integration table mappings. All custom mappings will be overwritten. If you have custom mappings that you want to keep, we recommend that you export them to Excel or talk to your Microsoft partner about other ways to keep your custom mappings.

# Consumption Variance (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Consumption Variance** report highlights the variance between expected and actual consumption costs on a monthly basis. The report can give a better understanding of consumption and ways to optimize production processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/consumption-variance-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Consumption Variance Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/consumption-variance-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to monitor and manage the consumption costs of production operations.

Production supervisors use this report to track the consumption costs of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual costs against the expected costs, you can quickly find and report deviations so the manufacturing manager can address them.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Consumption Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Actual Material Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-material-cost)
- [Expected Material Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost)
- [Standard Material Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost)
- [Expected Material Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost-variance)
- [Expcted Material Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost-dev-percent)
- [Standard Material Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost-variance)
- [Standard Material Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost-dev-percent)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order
- Item Ledger Entry

# Classifying data sensitivity fields

To classify the fields that hold sensitive or personal data, a Microsoft partner can set the ```DataClassification``` property on fields. This requires access to the database tables, either through the development environment or by running a Windows PowerShell script. For more information, see [Classifying Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).  

As a customer, you can add a second level of classification by specifying sensitivity levels for the data you store in standard and custom fields. Classifying data sensitivity helps ensure that you know where you keep personal data in your system, and makes it easier to respond to requests from data subjects. For example, if a contact or customer asks you to export their personal data. For more information, see [Responding to Requests About Personal Data](admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

> [!Important]  
> Microsoft is providing this Data Sensitivity Classification feature as a matter of convenience only. It's your responsibility to classify the data appropriately and comply with any laws and regulations that are applicable to you. Microsoft disclaims all responsibility towards any claims related to your classification of the data.  

The following table describes data sensitivity levels you can assign.

|Sensitivity|Description|
|----|----|
|Sensitive | Information about a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, involvement with trade unions, physical or mental health, sexuality, or details about criminal offenses. |
|Personal | Information that can be used to identify a data subject, either directly or in combination with other data or information.|
|Confidential | Business data that you use for accounting or other business purposes, and do not want to expose to other entities. For example, this might include ledger entries.|
|Normal | General data that does not belong to any other categories.|

## How do I classify my data?

Classifying the sensitivity of a large number of fields one-by-one would take a long time. To help speed up the process, we provide tools that you can use to bulk classify the sensitivity of fields, and then fine-tune classifications for specific fields. You can find tools on the Data Classification Worksheet page, which is available on the Administration of users, user groups, and permissions Role Center. You must be a system administrator to use the worksheet.
 
> [!Important]  
> When you open the Data Classification Worksheet page for the first time, it will be empty. You must run the Data Classification guide to generate the list of fields. To start the guide, choose the **Set Up Data Classifications** action.

For example, the Data Classification Worksheet page lets you do things like:  

* Use the Data Classification guide to export your fields to an Excel worksheet where you can bulk classify them. Using the Excel worksheet is particularly useful if you are collaborating with a Microsoft partner. After you update the worksheet, you can use the guide to import and apply the classifications. You can also use the guide to classify fields manually.  
* Choose a field and then filter the list to find similar fields that are likely to belong to the same classification as the field you based the search on.  
* Investigate a field by viewing its contents.  

> [!Tip]  
> We have defined sample sensitivity classifications for the tables and fields in the Cronus demonstration company. You can use those classifications as inspiration when you classify your own tables and fields.

# Setting Up Manufacturing

To convert material into produced end items, production resources, such as bills of material, routings, machine operators, and machinery must be set up in the system.

Operators and machines are represented in the system as machine centers that may be organized in work centers and work center groups. When these resources are established, they can be loaded with operations according to the item's defined material (BOM) and process (routing) structure, and according to the capacity of the machine or work center. You can also set the production capacity of each resource. Capacity is defined by the work time available in the machine and work centers, and is governed by calendars for each level. A work center calendar specifies the working days or hours, shifts, holidays, and absence that determine the work center's gross available capacity (typically measured in minutes). All of this is determined by defined efficiency and capacity values.  

When you have set up manufacturing, you can plan and execute production orders. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md) and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Setting up and troubleshooting your browser to work with Business Central Web Client

This article explains how to set up your browser so that the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] and all its features work properly. Read this article if you're having problems opening the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)], your browser's settings can be the cause of some problems.

The article provides details for setting up Microsoft Edge, but the requirements for JavaScript, cookies, and pop-ups are the same for all supported browsers. For other browsers, refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  

## Use a supported browser

Make sure to use a one of the supported browsers. See [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#browsers).

We recommend that you use a stable channel version of a web browser as it's the most reliable and stable version that has undergone extensive testing and bug fixing. This ensures that you have the best experience and are less likely to encounter any issues while using the web client.  

## Allow JavaScript from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow JavaScript, you see **NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript** in the address bar and an **HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found** message when you try to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the 

<!-- http://localhost:8080/NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found
The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. -->

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **JavaScript**.
2. Do one of the following steps. Choose the step that your organization recommends:

    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the left (Off). Then, select **Add** and type the address (URL) for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the **Site** box. Select **Add** when done.
    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the right (On).

## Allow cookies from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow cookies, you get the following error:

**Sorry, the page could not be found. Please check the address and try again.** 

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and site data**.
2. Move the **Allow sites to save and read cookie data** toggle to the right (On).  

## <a name="popup"></a>Allow pop-ups from Business Central

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with several products. In some cases, like with Microsoft Teams, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens, or "pop-ups," within the product. This capability requires that your browser allows pop-ups from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

*Problem:*

If pop-ups for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are being blocked, you get a message similar to the following message:

**Something went wrong. Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.**

<!--
Something went wrong
Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.

Change your browser settings to allow pop-ups or allow this for trusted domains, then try again.
If these settings are managed for your organization, you should contact your administrator for assistance.

Try again
-->
*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Pop-ups and redirects**.
2. Move the **Blocked** toggle to the right (On).
3. Select **Add**. In the **Site** box, type `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then select **Add**.

# Design Details: Warehouse Setup

Warehouse functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains different levels of complexity, as defined by license permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license. In addition, the application objects in the license govern which UI document to use for the supported warehouse activities.  
<!--
The following warehouse-related granules exist:  

- Basic Inventory (4010)  
- Bin (4170)  
- Put Away (4180)  
- Warehouse Receipt (4190)  
- Pick (4200)  
- Warehouse Shipment (4210)  
- Warehouse Management Systems (4620)  
- Internal Picks and Put-aways (4630)  
- Automated Data Capture System (4640)
- Bin Setup (4660)  

For more information about each granule, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Price Sheets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238341) (requires PartnerSource account). -->

The following table shows which granules are required to define different warehouse complexity levels, which UI documents support each level, and which location codes reflect these levels in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration database.  

[!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Bin and Bin Content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It is the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as bin content. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

A bin content can be given a property of Fixed, Dedicated, or Default to define how the bin content can be used. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question. The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied, the bin content does not disappear, and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource, such as a machine center, that uses the bin in question. Other non-pick content, such as quantities outbound on a shipment posting, can still be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

The Default bin property is used by the system to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At WMS locations, the Default bin property is not used. At locations where bins are required, the property is used in inbound flows to specify where to place items. In outbound flows, the property is used to specify where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound items are placed in several bins, then items are first taken from the non-default bins, to empty that bin content, and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

There can only be one default bin per item per location.  

## Bin Type

In WMS installations, you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it. The following bin types exist:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items posted as received but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. The replenishment of these bins can only be made by movement, not by put-away.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

For all bin types, except PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY, no other activity is allowed for the bin than what is defined by its bin type. For example, a bin of type **Receive** can only be used to receive items into or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC. Similarly, only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC.  

## Bin Ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally.  

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Similarly, pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking. Furthermore, bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse.  

## Bin Setup  
In advanced warehousing, bins can be set up with capacity values, such as quantity, total cubage, and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin.  

On each item card, you can assign a unit of measure (UOM) for the item, such as pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also have a base UOM for an item and specify larger UOMs that are based on it. For example, you can define a pallet to equal 16 pieces, the latter being the base UOM.  

If you want to set a maximum quantity of a specific item to be stored in an individual bin and the item has more than one UOM, then you must set the maximum quantity for every UOM that exists on the item card. Accordingly, if an item has been set up to be handled in pieces and pallets, then the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin is not calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations. I all other configurations, bin contents can only be in the base UOM. In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

## Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or several bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone.  

## Class  
In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to items, bins, and zones to control where different item classes are stored, such as frozen goods. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, items in the receiving zone can be stored as frozen, hazardous, or other class.  

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins are not assigned, then the quantity cannot be received.  

## Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped, potentially organized in bins. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant.  

## First Expired First Out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** check box on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card, then item-tracked items are picked according to their expiration date. The items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items in question already have serial/lot numbers assigned. If only a part of the quantity on the line already has serial/lot numbers assigned, then the remaining quantity to be picked is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, the available items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, then the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, then the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to this temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

## Put-away Template

The put-away template can be assigned to an item and to a location. The put-away template specifies a set of prioritized rules that must be respected when creating put-aways. For example, a put-away template may require that the item is placed in a bin with bin content that matches the UOM, and if a similar bin with enough capacity cannot be found, then the item must be placed in an empty bin.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Find answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can configure some of the links, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the [landing page on Microsoft Learn](index.yml) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described in the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) Learn more in the [Learn more using the product documentation](#learn-more-using-the-product-documentation) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/product/dynamics-365-business-central/), including any special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to the Microsoft commercial marketplace where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners. Use the links to explore the full capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you decide if you want to buy a subscription. You can also find a link to contact the sales team.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online trial experiences. If you already bought [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the section isn't longer visible.

### Give feedback

Periodically, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] team gathers feedback from our users about how satisfied they are with the product. In addition to ratings, you can also provide a written comment. By giving us specific and actionable comments, you help our engineering teams to prioritize the product improvements we invest in. You can also consent to be contacted about your comment. If you do, you're invited to a Teams meeting at a time that's convenient for you. You can provide product suggestions at any time on our [Dynamics 365 Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website.  

### Product suggestions

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website, you can provide suggestions for new features and capabilities. Your input goes directly into Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. There's a chance that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. Learn more in [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the extra telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)  
- [Managing environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments)  
- [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview)  
- [Enable sending telemetry to Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights)  

### Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner helps you with technical support. This section makes it easy for you to contact your reselling partner, if they submit their support contact details. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

Learn more in [Escalating support issues to Microsoft](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#escalating-support-issues-to-microsoft) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Report a Problem** section is only available if you have paid for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you don't have a reselling partner, and you can't contact the Microsoft support team. You can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page. Learn more in [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  
>
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, this section is only available in 2020 release wave 2 (version 18) and later.

### Support contacts

The **Report a problem** section displays an email address or a hyperlink for you to get in contact with the customer support person or team, like: Do you need technical support? Contact support at `someone@example.com` or `https://www.contoso.com`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If support contact details aren't present, it means that your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner hasn't provided the information. As a reslling partner, you set up the preferred support contact details in the admin center. Learn more in [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Learn more using the product documentation

A large community of partners extend and customize the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](index.yml) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following content:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](welcome.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](welcome.md) of Microsoft Learn hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following list:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel shows the table of contents that groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries/regions that Microsoft supports. If you don’t see your country/region listed there, it’s probably because a partner localizes your country/region. Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the specific country/region version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the learn.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country/region, for example.

### Find other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on Microsoft Learn:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link, you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site then searches all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on Microsoft Learn from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on Microsoft Learn.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you can't read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country or region that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of Microsoft Learn (`https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

On Microsoft Learn, each article shows a pane with links to other articles. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

With Microsoft Learn, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The **This product** button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigate to other parts of the site

Microsoft Learn hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

# Design Details: Cost Adjustment

The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients, according to an item’s costing method, to provide correct inventory valuation.  

An item can be sales invoiced before it has been purchase invoiced, so that the recorded inventory value of the sale does not match the actual purchase cost. Cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold (COGS) for historic sales entries to ensure that they match the costs of the inbound transactions to which they are applied. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

The following are secondary purposes, or functions, of cost adjustment:  

* Invoice finished production orders:  

  * Change the status of value entries from **Expected** to **Actual**.  
  * Clear WIP accounts. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).  
  * Post variance. For more information, see [Design Details: Variance](design-details-variance.md).  
  * Update the unit cost on the item card.  

Inventory costs must be adjusted before the related value entries can be reconciled with the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Detecting the Adjustment

The task of detecting if cost adjustment should occur is primarily performed by the Item Jnl.-Post Line routine, while the task of calculating and generating cost adjustment entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

To be able to forward costs, the detection mechanism determines which sources have changed in costs and to which destination these costs should be forwarded. The following three detection functions exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Item Application Entry  
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point  
* Order Level  

### Item Application Entry

This detection function is used for items that use FIFO, LIFO, Standard, and Specific costing methods and for fixed applications scenarios. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as *Applied Entry to Adjust* whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded according to the cost chains that are recorded in the **Item Application Entry** table.  

### Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point

This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking a record in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table whenever a value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date.  

### Order Level

This detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting. The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure:  

![Flow of entries in cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Flow of entries in cost adjustment")  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment

Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways:  

* Manually, by running the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can run this batch job either for all items or for only certain items or item categories. This batch job runs a cost adjustment for the items in inventory for which an inbound transaction has been made, such as a purchase. For items that use the average costing method, the batch job also makes an adjustment if any outbound transactions are created.  
* Automatically, by adjusting costs every time that you post an inventory transaction, and when you finish a production order. The cost adjustment is only run for the specific item or items affected by the posting. This is set up when you select the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page.  

It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate. The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often.  

Because it is important to keep the unit cost of an item up to date, it is recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job as often as possible, during nonworking hours. Alternatively, use automatic cost adjustment. This ensures that the unit cost is updated for items daily.  

Regardless if you run the cost adjustment manually or automatically, the adjustment process and its consequences are the same. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value of the inbound transaction and forwards that cost to any outbound transactions, such as sales or consumptions, which have been applied to the inbound transaction. The cost adjustment creates value entries that contain adjustment amounts and amounts that compensate for rounding.  

The new adjustment and rounding value entries have the posting date of the related invoice. Exceptions are if the value entries fall in a closed accounting period or inventory period or if the posting date is earlier than the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. If this occurs, the batch job assigns the posting date as the first date of the next open period.  

## Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you have the option to run the batch job for all items or for only certain items or categories.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job, or to fix the cost of a certain item.  

### Example

The following example shows if you post a purchased item as received and invoiced on 01-01-20. You later post the sold item as shipped and invoiced on 01-15-20. Then, you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** and **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch jobs. The following entries are created.  

#### Value Entries (1) 

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|10.00|10.00|1|1|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-10.00|-10.00|-1|2|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (1)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  

#### General Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-10.00|2|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-10.00|3|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|10.00|4|  

Later, you post a related purchase item charge for 2.00 LCY invoiced on 02-10-20. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job and then run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. The cost adjustment batch job adjusts the cost of the sale by -2.00 LCY accordingly, and the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job posts the new value entries to the general ledger. The result is as follows.  

#### Value Entries (2)  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Adjustment|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|  
|02-10-20|Purchase|2.00|2.00|0|No|3|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-2.00|-2.00|0|Yes|4|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (2)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|5|3|2|  
|6|3|2|  
|7|4|2|  
|8|4|2|  

#### General Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|02-10-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|2.00|5|  
|02-10-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-2.00|6|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-2.00|7|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|2.00|8|  

## Automatic Cost Adjustment

To set up cost adjustment to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, use the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. This field enables you to select how far back in time from the current work date that you want automatic cost adjustment to be performed. The following options exist.  

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Never|Costs are not adjusted when you post.|  
|Day|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date.|  
|Week|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date.|  
|Month|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date.|  
|Quarter|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date.|  
|Year|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date.|  
|Always|Costs are always adjusted when you post, regardless of the posting date.|  

The selection that you make in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field is important for performance and the accuracy of your costs. Shorter time periods, such as **Day** or **Week**, affect system performance less, because they provide the stricter requirement that only costs posted in the last day or week can be automatically adjusted. This means that the automatic cost adjustment does not run as frequently and therefore affects system performance less. However, it also means that unit costs may be less accurate.  

### Example

The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario:  

* On January 10, you post a purchased item as received and invoiced.  
* On January 15, you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced.
* On February 5, you receive an invoice for a freight charge on the original purchase. You post this freight charge, applying it to the original purchase invoice, which increases the cost of the original purchase.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a day or a week from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment does not run, and the cost of the purchase is not forwarded to the sale until you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

title: Use back links to explore aggregated data in visuals  
description: When you're analyzing a visual in Power BI, back links let you go to the data behind the graphic.

# Use back links to explore the data behind visuals

Back links make it easy to go from the aggregated data in reports in Power BI to the transactional data or source documents behind it in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The connection between the visuals and the backstory lets you quickly validate, audit, and reconcile figures.

## Where you can expect to find back links

Back links are added to tables and matrices that display aggregated values or detail entries in Power BI. Some examples include:

- [**Daily Sales by Date**](sales-powerbi-daily-sales.md): Quickly go to detailed sales transactions for a specific day.
- [**Income Statement by Month**](finance-powerbi-income-statement.md): View the underlying G/L entries for monthly financial summaries.
- [**Moving Annual Total Details**](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md): Drill down to transaction-level details for moving annual totals.

## How back links work

Back links use custom Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) measures to dynamically generate web URLs that link to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] instance connected to the Power BI report.

The DAX measure retrieves and concatenates the **Tenant ID**, **Environment Name**, and **Company Name** from the report parameters and queries.

The filter context in Power BI, such as the **Date** filter, and other key fields construct the URL. The URL filters the relevant transactions or documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that correspond to the data displayed in the Power BI report.

## Example

This example uses the [**Income Statement by Month**](finance-powerbi-income-statement.md) matrix in the Power BI Finance App to illustrate the advantages that back links provide.

The **Income Statement by Month** matrix in Power BI shows aggregated financial figures by G/L accounts and months.

Without back links, you typically need to:

1. Drill through the numbers in Power BI.
2. Manually note the entry numbers.
3. Reconcile and locate the entries in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, with back links:

- Links are added to both Level 1 accounts and sublevel accounts in the matrix.
- Clicking a back link takes you to the detailed entries in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that make up the aggregated figure.
- If a **Date Filter** is applied in Power BI, the URL includes it to filter the transactions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For example, to show the transactions that make up the figure of the "5460 Cost of Capacities" account for January 2021, the URL displays the filtered G/L entries in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Limitations

Currently, back links don't consider all visual and page filters applied in the Power BI report. The URL includes only **Date Filters**.

# Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview

Small and mid-sized companies rely on built-in analytics and reporting capabilities they can use out-of-the-box to help keep track of their business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides reports and analytics tools that cover basic and complex business processes.

## Analytics needs in organizations

When you think about analytics in your organization, it might help to use a persona-based model to outline different needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

The model is based on the fact that different roles in an organization have different needs when it comes to data. The higher a role is placed in the organizational chart, the more aggregated data someone in the role needs to do their work.

Roles often have preferred ways to consume and analyze data, ways that reflect the level of data aggregation they need.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

Use the following sections to learn more about ways to consume data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Financial Reports
- KPIs and dashboards
- Power BI apps
- Ad-hoc analysis
- Reports

## Using Financial Reports to produce financial statements and KPIs

The Financial Reports feature gives you insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of a financial report." lightbox="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg":::

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics. For example, groups of customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Groups make it easier to retrieve data for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial statements and KPIs, go to [Using Financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs](bi.md).

## Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way to measure whether you’re delivering on your objectives.

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know whether your business is on the right path, or whether you should change course. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

To learn more about KPIs, go to [Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals](./analytics-about-kpis.md)

## Built-in Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI apps/reports by functional area](across-powerbi-apps-by-functional-area.md)

## Ad-hoc data analysis

You might just want to check whether the numbers add up correctly, quickly confirm or debunk a hypothesis about the business, or maybe look for anomalies in your financial data. For ad-hoc analyses, you might not have a built-in report that helps answer your questions. For ad-hoc analyses, use these two features:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as the General Ledger Entries or Customer Ledger Entries pages, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit. 

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png":::

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

To learn more about ad-how analyses, go to [Ad hoc data analysis](reports-adhoc-analysis.md).

## Reports

A report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gathers information based on a specified set of criteria. Reports organize and present the information in an easy-to-read format you can use in Excel, print, or save as a file.  

As an example of an interactive report in Excel, the **Aged Accounts Receivable** report lets you analyze what your customers owe you and when payments are due.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png" alt-text="Example of the interactive aged accounts receivables report in Excel." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png":::

For aged accounts receivables, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also includes a report designed for print. The ability to print is handy if you prefer to have the data in a .pdf file.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png" alt-text="Example of the  aged accounts receivables report in pdf." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png":::

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with more than 300 built-in reports that you can use to support your business processes with data-driven insights. To get a quick overview of all the reports that are available for your role, you can open the report explorer from the role center and all list pages and from **Tell Me**.

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-finance.png" alt-text="Example of how the report explorer shows all reports for a role." lightbox="media/report-explorer-finance.png":::

To learn more about using the report explorer to see all built-in reports, go to [Exploring reports per Role](ui-role-explorer.md).

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.
    - ![Connectivity check failed.](media/connectivity-failed.png) indicates the check failed. Review the message below the check for more details.
    - ![Connectivity check was not run.](media/connectivity-blocked.png) indicates the check wasn't run, typically because of a failure of a previous check. Review the message below the check for more details.

4. To run the check again, choose **Restart check**.

The following sections explain the checks that are run, and provide some tips for fixing any problems.

## Basic internet connectivity

Checks that you have connection to the Internet by verifying that you can access a known public domain, like www.bing.com.

# Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Users with a Business Central license can view, modify, and act on their business data from any user interface. For other employees across your organization that only need to occasionally view data, Business Central offers access through Microsoft 365.  

If your organization has both a Business Central and a Microsoft 365 subscription, admins set up environments so users sign in with Microsoft 365 licenses but can access only specific tables and other objects. When configured, employees that have a Microsoft 365 license but no [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license can view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.


## Why enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses  

- Unlock master data that every employee across the organization should have access to.

- Empower departments that don’t run on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to self-serve, by accessing key data needed to successfully perform their tasks, eliminating the need for continually requesting data from others.

- Increase collaboration efficacy so that tasks and projects that span across departments complete on time, by eliminating the friction that is typically associated with access denied errors due to licensing.

- Increase team performance so that people can make data-driven decisions that are inclusive of everyone in the group, even if they don’t work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Meet licensing budget targets by assigning licenses that match employee needs:

  - Microsoft 365 licenses for read-only access
  - Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member licenses for limited write access
  - Dynamics 365 Business Central Essentials or Premium licenses for full write access.

- Improve data security by reducing the need for pasting screen snippets of business data outside of data governance boundaries.

## Use rights

When a person accesses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a Microsoft 365 license, the license entitles the user to read (but not write) [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data through a simplified user interface in Microsoft Teams. This section explains these use rights and limitations that help you plan how to configure and make the most out of this capability. Learn more about this license type compared to other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses in the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
 
### Client access

Users are entitled to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Microsoft Teams. The following table summarizes which of the different methods of accessing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service are allowed with this license.

|Client accessing the Business Central service |Access|
|-|-|
|Business Central app for Microsoft Teams|![Yes](media/check.png)|

## Minimum requirements

This section explains the minimum requirements for your organization to use Microsoft 365 licenses, and for individual Microsoft Teams users to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data without a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### Requirements to enable access

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (SaaS).

### Requirements for individual users to access data in Teams

- Data must be accessed using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. Users must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed and must use one of the supported Teams clients. Get a list of Teams clients supported by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

- Users must be internal to the organization. A user identity originates from the same home tenant where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed and access is enabled. External identities aren't supported. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically prevents access to guests.

- Users must be assigned a Microsoft 365 license from one of the following plans.

# Production Order WIP (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

 The **Production Order WIP** report provides insights into the work-in-progress (WIP) inventory across production orders, displaying both trends and detailed valuation data.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/production-order-wip-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Production Order WIP Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/production-order-wip-v26.png":::

The **Production Order WIP Report** consists of two key visuals that give insights into work-in-progress (WIP) inventory. The top visual is a timeline chart that showcases the **Ending Balance Value of WIP** inventory over time. The visual plots the **Ending Balance Value** as the Y-axis and the **Month Year** as the X-axis to offer a clear trend analysis and lets you find fluctuations and patterns in WIP inventory.

The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** table gives you a detailed breakdown of production order-related inventory valuation. The table includes essential columns, such as:

- Production Order
- Description
- Source Type
- Source No.
- Starting and Ending Dates
- Beginning Balance
- Consumption
- Capacity
- Output
- Ending Balance Value

Together, these visuals provide both high-level and detailed perspectives on WIP inventory.

# Register consumption and output for a released production order

Use the **Production Journal** page to register consumption output for a released production order. The journal combines the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. You open the combined journal from a released production order. Its purpose is to manually post the consumption of components, the quantity of end items produced, and the time spent on operations. The values post to ledger entries under the released production order. Consumption quantities post as negative item ledger entries, output quantities post as positive ledger entries, and time spent posts as capacity ledger entries. The posted values also display at the bottom of the journal as actual quantities.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Because consumption data is processed together with output data, this journal displays linked components and operations in a logical process structure. Components are indented under their respective operation. This linking requires that you use routing link codes. To learn more about routing links, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Components without routing link codes list first in the journal.  

## To register consumption and output  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Released Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a released production order line that's ready to register. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Production Journal** action.  

    The **Production Journal** page shows journal lines for the production order line according to the **Prod. Order Component** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages. These lines come from the production BOM and routing assigned to the item that is being produced. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a posting date that applies to all lines. The work date is entered by default. The field is meant as a quick way to align posting dates on all lines, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Posting dates on individual lines override this field.  

4. In the **Flushing Method Filter** field, you can choose to also view consumption and output that is posted automatically according to the flushing methods defined for the item and resource respectively. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

5. Enter the consumption and output quantities.  
  
    On each type of line in the journal, only the relevant fields are shown. Other fields are blank and you can't edit them.  

    When you open the journal, it shows the quantities to post. If nothing is posted so far, all quantity fields show the expected quantities from the production order. If partial postings were done, the quantity fields on the lines show the remaining quantities. The quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  

    > [!TIP]
    > For the quantities in the **Output Quantity** field, you can specify which values to preset when you first open the journal. On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, enter the value in the **Preset Output Quantity** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the output quantity on the last journal line of entry type **Output** adjusts the inventory level when posting the journal. Therefore, don't post the journal with the expected output quantity preset on the last output line until all end items are produced.  

6. Select the **Finished** field of output lines to indicate that the operation is finished. This field is related to the **Routing Status** field on a production order routing line.  
7. Choose the **Post** action to register the quantities and then close the journal.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    If values remain to be posted, the journal contains the remaining values the next time you open it. Posted values show as actual values in the bottom of the journal.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If an item that's being consumed is blocked, the journal doesn't post consumption quantities for it. If a machine or work center is blocked, the journal doesn't post output quantities or process times for the output line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you close the journal without posting, the changes are lost.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Only one person can use the **Production Journal** page at a time. For example, User 2 opens the page and enters data when User 1 is already working on the page. User 2 might lose their data when User 1 closes the page.

# Manage human resources

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

You can also register employee absences, which allows you to analyze registered absences as necessary.

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set up calculations and posting methods for value-added tax

Consumers and businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) when they purchase goods or services. The amount of VAT to pay can vary, depending on several factors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up VAT to specify the rates used to calculate tax amounts based on the following parameters:

* Who you sell to  
* Who you buy from  
* What you sell  
* What you buy  

You can set up VAT calculations manually, but that can be tricky and time-consuming. It's easy to use different VAT rates by mistake and create inaccurate VAT-related reports. To make VAT set up easier, we recommend you use the **VAT Setup** assisted setup guide.

However, if you want to set up the VAT calculations yourself, or just want to learn about each step, this article contains descriptions of each step.  

[!INCLUDE [finance-vat](includes/finance-vat.md)]

## Set up VAT using the assisted setup guide (recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the **VAT Setup** guide only if you have created a *My Company* and haven't posted transactions that include VAT. To learn more about a My Company, go to [Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).

To start the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Assisted Setup**. 
2. Choose **Set up Value-Added Tax (VAT)** and complete the steps.
3. After you complete the assisted setup, go to the **VAT Posting Setup** page to check whether you need to fill in more fields according to the local requirements in your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Local functionality in Business Central](about-localization.md).  

### Check the VAT posting setup

To support your fast start, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] notifies you of missing general ledger (G/L) accounts in posting groups or posting setups, such as on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. You can turn this type of notification on or off using the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification in the **My Notifications** page. Just go to the **My settings** page, and then choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link.  

If you choose the notification, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates posting setups based on the posting groups in the document or journal you're currently working on.  

At this point, you can just fill in the missing G/L accounts. But, when you further refine your setup later, you might realize your initial setup is wrong. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't allow you to delete a VAT posting setup and general posting setup after they're used to create entries. To prevent people from mistakenly using a setup that's no longer relevant for new postings, you can use the **Blocked** field on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up a default VAT date for documents and journals

VAT reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the **VAT Date** to include VAT entries on VAT reports in a VAT period. The VAT date can be changed on all documents and journals, but you must specify a default value for VAT date.

> [!NOTE]
> After posting the document or journal, the **VAT Date** will appear on **VAT Entries** and **G/L Entries** as well as on the posted document if exists.

To set up a default value for a VAT date, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Default VAT Date** field, choose either **Posting Date** or **Document Date**.
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Default VAT Date** is the **Posting Date**.

### Enable or disable the VAT Date feature

Some countries/regions require that businesses use a specific VAT date, but other countries/regions don't. Some countries/regions also require businesses to change the VAT date in specific situations after they post documents, but other countries/regions don't allow changes to VAT dates. To allow for different contexts, you can choose whether you want to use this functionality and, if so, to what degree.

To set up the level of VAT date usage, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Date Usage** field, specify the degree to which you want to use the VAT date feature. You can choose one of the following options:

   | Type | Description |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Use full VAT Date functionality** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default, giving you the maximum **VAT Date** functionality. You can set up the date, change it in documents, report based on it, and modify the date after posting as long as the period isn't closed or protected with allowed dates for posting. |
   | **Use but do not allow modifications** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default with one exception. You can't modify the **VAT Date** in **VAT Entries**. |
   | **Not using VAT Date functionality** | [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] hides and makes the **VAT Date** fields unavailable on documents, journals, and entries. The **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**. |

3. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you choose the **Not using VAT Date functionality** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the **VAT Date** in the background. Because the **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**, and you can't change it in this case, you'll get the same experience as without this feature. **VAT Date** fields will be removed from all pages, but this field will still exist in tables and reports will work based on it.

### Limiting periods for posting and changing the VAT date

You can prevent people from posting or changing VAT entries in specific date ranges. You set the restriction using two settings:

* Based on closed **VAT Return Period**
* Based on the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.

#### To limit posting based on VAT return period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the TellF Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Control VAT Period** field, specify the degree of VAT Return Period control. The following table describes the options.

| Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Block posting within closed and warn for released period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing VAT entries that have a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows a warning if your **VAT Return Period** is open, but the status of **VAT Return** is **Released** or **Submitted**. |
| **Block posting within closed period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing vat entries that have a VAT date within the closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Warn when posting in closed period** | Show a warning, but don't block posting, if you want to post a document or journal that has a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Disabled** | Take no action based on a closed **VAT Return Period**. |

#### Limit posting based on Allow from/to period

> [!NOTE]
> As of Business Central version 23.1, this control is changed. In earlier versions, there was only one control on the **General Ledger Setup** page for both Posting Date and VAT Date. Now, these controls are split, so control in the **General Ledger Setup** page is for the **Posting Date** only and control in the **VAT Setup** page is for the **VAT Date** only. There are also new date controls in the **User Setup** page.  

##### Version 23.1 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you upgrade to a newversion, be aware that values are upgraded in the new **Allow VAT Date From/To** in the **VAT Setup** page based on the values in **Allow Posting From/To** in the **General Ledger Setup**. If you want to use different date controls, open the **VAT Setup** page and make changes.  

You can set up limitations on the company or at specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed. 

To limit postings for the specific user:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in a specific period.  
3. In the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed. 
4. In the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.  

##### Versions before 23.1 

You can set up limitation on the company or specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

To limit postings for the specific user:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in specific period.  
3. In the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.
4. In the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for your country/region

To help ensure people enter valid VAT registration numbers, you can define formats for the VAT registration numbers that are used in the countries/regions in which you do business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays an error message if someone makes a mistake or uses a format that is incorrect for the country/region.

To set up VAT registration numbers, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**.
2. Choose the country or region, and then choose the **VAT Reg. No. Formats** action.
3. In the **Formats** field, define the format by entering one or more of the following characters:  

* **#** Requires a single-digit number.  
* **@** Requires a letter. This format isn't case-sensitive.  
* **?** Allows any character.  

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use other characters as long as they are always present in the country or region format. So, if you need to include a period or a hyphen between sets of numbers, you can define the format as ##.####.### or @@-###-###.  

## Set up VAT business posting groups

VAT business posting groups should represent the markets in which you do business with customers and vendors, and define how to calculate and post VAT in each market. Examples of VAT business posting groups are **Domestic** and **European Union (EU)**.  

Use codes that are easy to remember and describe the business posting group, such as **EU**, **Non-EU**, or **Domestic**. Each code must be unique, meaning you can set up as many codes as you need, but you can't have the same code more than once in a table.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

You can set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the VAT business posting group when you assign the business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account.

## Set up VAT product posting groups

VAT product posting groups represent the items and resources you buy or sell, and determine how to calculate and post VAT according to the type of item or resource.

It's a good idea to use codes that are easy to remember and describe the rate, such as **NO-VAT** or **Zero**, **VAT10** or **Reduced** for 10 percent VAT, and **VAT25** or **Standard** for 25 percent.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT amounts on sales and purchases based on VAT posting setups, which are combinations of VAT business and product posting groups. For each combination, you can specify the VAT percent, VAT calculation type, and general ledger accounts for posting VAT for sales, purchases, and reverse charges. You can also specify whether to recalculate VAT when a payment discount is applied or received.  

Set up as many combinations as you need. To group VAT posting setup combinations with similar attributes, define a **VAT Identifier** for each group, and assign the identifier to the group members.  

> [!NOTE]
> A **VAT Identifier** is a code you can use to group similar attributes. We recommend you use different VAT identifiers for different VAT percentages.  

To combine VAT posting setups, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Assign VAT posting groups by default to multiple entities

If you want to apply the same VAT posting groups to multiple entities, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to do so by default.

* You can assign VAT business posting groups to general business posting groups, or customer or vendor templates.
* You can assign VAT product posting groups on general product posting groups.  

The VAT business or product posting group is assigned when you choose a business or product posting group for a customer, vendor, item, or resource.

## Assign VAT posting groups to accounts, customers, vendors, items, and resources

The following sections describe how to assign VAT posting groups to individual entities.

### To assign VAT posting groups to individual general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the **G/L Account Card** for the account.  
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Posting Type** field, choose either **Sale** or **Purchase**.  
4. Choose the VAT posting groups to use for the sales or purchase account.  

### To assign VAT business posting groups to customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customer** or **Vendor** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the **VAT Bus. Posting Group**.  

### To assign VAT product posting groups to individual items and resources

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item** or **Resource**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following steps:  

    * On the **Item** card, expand the **Price & Posting** FastTab, and then choose **Show more** to display the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
    * On the **Resource** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the VAT product posting group.  

## Set up clauses to explain VAT exemption or nonstandard VAT rates

You set up a VAT clause to describe information about the type of VAT that is being applied. Government regulations might require this information. After you set up a VAT clause and associate it with a VAT posting setup, the VAT clause displays on printed sales documents that use the VAT posting group setup.

If needed, you can also specify how to translate VAT clauses to other languages. When you create and print a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the document includes the translated VAT clause. The language code specified on the customer card determines the language.

When you use nonstandard VAT rates in different types of documents, such as invoices or credit memos, you might have to include an exemption text (VAT clause). The exemption text states why you calculated a reduced VAT or zero VAT rate. You can define different VAT clauses to include on business documents for each type of document on the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page.

You can modify or delete a VAT clause, and your modifications are reflected in a generated report. However, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep a history of the change. On the report, the VAT clause descriptions are printed and displayed for all lines in the report alongside the VAT amount and the VAT base amount. If a VAT clause isn't defined for any lines on the sales document, the whole section is omitted when you print the report.

### To set up VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Clauses** page, create a new line.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter an identifier for the clause. You use this code to assign the clause to VAT posting groups.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter the VAT exemption text that you want to display on documents that can include VAT. In the **Description 2** field, enter more text, if needed. The text is displayed on new document lines.
5. Choose the **Description by document type** action.
6. On the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page, fill in the fields to set up which VAT exemption text to display for which document type.  
7. Optional: To assign the VAT clause to a VAT posting setup right away, choose **Setup**, and then choose the clause. If you want to wait, you can assign the clause later on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  
8. Optional: To specify how to translate the VAT clause, choose the **Translations** action.

### To assign a VAT clause to a VAT posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **VAT Clause Code** column, choose the clause to use for each VAT posting setup it applies to.  

### To specify translations for VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Translations** action.  
3. In the **Language Code** field, choose the language you're translating to.  
4. In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the translations of the descriptions. This text displays in the translated VAT report documents.  

### To specify extended text for VAT clauses

> [!NOTE]  
> If your country or region requires longer text for the VAT clauses than the default version supports, you can specify the longer text for the VAT clauses as *extended text* so that it prints on the sales and purchase reports.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Extended Texts** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the **Language Code** and **Description** fields.  
5. Optionally, select the **All Language Codes** field, or specify the relevant language in the **Language Code** field if you use language codes.  
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.  
7. In the **Text** lines, write the extended text for your VAT clauses.  
8. Select the relevant fields for the document types where you want the extended text printed.  
9. Close the page.  

## Create a VAT posting setup to handle Import VAT

Use the *Import VAT* feature when you need to post a document where the entire amount is VAT. You use this feature if you receive an invoice from the tax authorities for VAT for imported goods.  

To set up codes for import VAT, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 12.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the VAT Product Posting Groups page, set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 13.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4. On the VAT Posting Setup page, create a new line, or use an existing VAT business posting groups in combination with the new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
5. In the **VAT Calculation Type** field, choose **Full VAT**.  
6. In the **Purchase VAT Account** field, enter the general ledger account to use for posting import VAT. All other accounts are optional.  

## Use reverse charge VAT for trade between EU countries/regions

Some companies must use reverse charge VAT when trading with other companies. For example, this rule applies to purchases from EU countries/regions and sales to EU countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule applies when trading with companies that are registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region. If you do business directly with consumers in other EU countries/regions, then you should contact your tax authority for applicable VAT rules.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can verify that a company is registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region by using the EU VAT Registration Number Validation service. The service is available for free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Verify VAT registration numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

### Sales to EU countries/regions

VAT isn't calculated on sales to VAT-liable companies in other EU countries/regions. You must report the value of these sales to EU countries/regions separately on your VAT statement.  

To correctly calculate VAT on sales to EU countries/regions, you should:  

* Set up a line for sales with the same information for purchases. If you set up lines on the **VAT Posting Setup** page for purchases from EU countries/regions, you can also use these lines for sales.  
* Assign the VAT business posting groups in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab of the customer card of each EU customer. You should also enter the customer's VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** field on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.  

When you post a sale to a customer in another EU country/region, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the VAT amount and creates a VAT entry based on information about the reverse charge VAT and the VAT base. This amount is used to calculate the VAT amount. No entries are posted to the VAT accounts in the general ledger.

If you want to use combination of VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group for reporting as services in the periodic VAT reports, mark the **EU Service** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **EU Service** field is only applicable for VAT reports. The field isn't related to the **Service Declaration** or **Intrastat for Services** features.

## VAT rounding for documents

Amounts in documents that aren't posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are posted. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT for a complete document. The VAT calculation is based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document.  

## Set up VAT reporting

You must set up information about how the tax authorities in your country or region require you to submit VAT reports. The following steps illustrate the most commonly used information. However, your country or region might require other steps. For more information, see the relevant article in the *Local functionality* section in the panel to the left.

# Add Companies to Your Company Hub

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

With the company hub, you can access your work from across multiple companies from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. You can add a environments and companies manually, if your companies do not show up automatically in the company hub.  

Right in the company hub landing page, you find the **Setup** menu, from where you can access the **Environment Links** page. Simply choose **New**, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect the company hub to as many companies as you need. However, you can only connect the company hub to companies that are hosted in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Environment links

An environment link is a card where you specify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that hosts one or more companies that you do work in. The data in the card for each environment is specified by you, and you can change it as needed. However, the **Environment Link** field is critical - this is how you can access each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Test the connection** action in the ribbon to test that you entered the right link. The link that you must enter points at environment that hosts the company that you are adding, and it must include the Microsoft Entra ID, or the organization's domain name. For example, if they have specified a domain such as MyBusiness.com, then the link to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/mybusiness.com?redirectedfromsignup=1```. Otherwise, it will look something like this: ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```  

The link is used when you choose the company in the company hub.  

:::image type="content" source="media/company-hub-company-list-actions.png" alt-text="Actions for a company that is listed in the company hub.":::

> [!TIP]
> If you're working in the free trial version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it is easy to add the companies in your tenant. You can find the environment link by copying the ID for Microsoft Entra from the **Troubleshooting** section of the Help & Support page. The environment name is probably the default value, PRODUCTION. Add this information to the **Environment Link** field, such as ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```, and then choose **Test the connection**. The evaluation company will be added to the list.
>
> If you have moved to the thirty-day trial company, My Company, you can add that to the list by choosing the **Reload / Reload all Companies** action in the list.

## Load companies

When you have added your environments, your companies show up automatically. However, if you know that a new company has been added to an environment, you can choose the **Reload all companies** action to refresh the list. Use the same action to refresh data from across your companies.  

> [!TIP]
> In order to refresh the data in the company hub, you must have access to the data in the companies that the data comes from.

# Sustainability value chain in transfers

To use the sustainability value chain with transfer orders, you must enable the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with transfer orders  

To learn how to work with transfer orders, go to [To transfer items with a transfer order](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md#to-transfer-items-with-a-transfer-order).  

To use transfer orders in the sustainability value chain process, you must add the carbon equivalent (CO2e) emission that you produce in the transfer process. For example, if you transfer goods by truck. You can add it in the **Total CO2e** field for each line on a transfer order. The value is the total emissions for the item quantities on the lines.

After you post a transfer order, you can find entries related to the transfer on the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page. To find the entries, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted transfer shipments**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Posted Transfer Shipment** you want to check, and then choose the **Find entries** action.
3. On the **Find entries** page, choose **Sustainability Value Entry** to review the transactions related to this document.
4. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you select the **Direct Transfer** field on the **Transfer Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries only for transactions related to the posted transfer shipment. The transactions increase the **CO2e per Unit** value for transferred items using the average method.

# Register new items

Items, among other products, are the basis of your business, the goods, or services that you trade in. Each item must be registered as an item card.

## To create a new item card

The following video shows how to set up an item on the Item Card page. However, you can also set up new items by copying existing ones. To learn more, go to [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

## Use item templates

To reuse settings for different types of items when you create new items, you can save items as item templates. Item templates help speed-up the process of adding new items, and increase consistency in your item data. When you register a new item, a page appears that lets you choose a template. After you choose a template, its settings are filled in for you on the item you're creating. If you only have one item template, new items always use that template. 

### Save an item card as an item template

1. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Item Template** page shows the item card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Dimensions**. The **Default Dimensions** for the selected item open showing any dimension codes that are set up for the item.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes that apply to new item cards created by using the template.
5. When you complete the new item template, choose the **OK** button.

The item template is added to the list of item templates, so that you can use it to create new item cards.

## Types of items

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory.

* **Inventory** specifies that the item is a physical unit that you manage and track in inventory.
* **Non-Inventory** are physical units that you don't manage or track in inventory.
* **Service** items are a labor time unit, typically used to register sells or purchase of services.

To learn more about these types of items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

> [!TIP]
> There are also catalog items, which are similar to non-inventory items in that they're items that you offer to customers but don't manage until you sell them. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).  

## Inventory costing

In the **Costing Method** field, you set up how the item's unit cost is calculated by making assumptions about the flow of physical items through your company. Five costing methods are available, depending on the type of item. To learn more about costing, go to [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you select **Average**, the item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. With this setting, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** page to view the transactions that were used to calculate the average cost.

## Categories, attributes, and variants

[!INCLUDE[inventory_variant](includes/inventory_variant.md)]

Learn more about variants at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).  

## Set up item substitutions

You can set up items to have replacements, such as other items that can be used in place of the original item.

> [!TIP]
> If you know your item catalog well, or only have a few items, you might want to specify the substitute items yourself. However, if you have a larger portfolio, the suggest item substitutes capability for Copilot can help. Copilot can suggest substitute items based on item attributes. To learn more about the AI capability, go to [Find item substitutions faster with Copilot](suggest-item-substitutions-copilot.md).

### To make an item substitution

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Find the relevant item, and then choose the **No.** to open the Item Card.  
3. Choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Substitutions** to open the **Item Substitution Entry** page.  
4. Choose the **Substitute No.** field, and then select the replacement item from the list.
5. Fill in or change other fields on the page as necessary.

When the requested quantity exceeds the quantity that is available in inventory, a message appears to inform you that substitute items exist.

> [!NOTE]  
> Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

## Prices and discounts

You can use special prices or discounts that you grant for the item based on certain criteria. For example, criteria include the customer, minimum order quantity, or ending date. You set up special prices by choosing the **Set Special Prices** or **Set Special Discounts** actions. Each row on, for example, the **Sales Prices** page represents a special price. Each column represents a criterion that must apply to grant a customer the special price that you enter in the **Unit Price** field on the **Sales Prices** page. To learn more about pricing, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Replenishment

You can specify how items are supplied:

* **Purchase Order** if you want to buy items.
* **Assembly order** or **Production order** if you produce the items in-house.

There are other settings that compliment these selections.

### Include items in bills of materials

You can structure hierarchies that have a main item with underlying component items in assembly and production bills of materials (BOM). To learn more about BOMs, go to [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

### Items used in production orders

To register items that you use in production orders, specify the replenishment system as **Prod. order** on the **Replenishment** FastTab. For more information, see [About Production Orders](production-about-production-orders.md).  

### Primary and alternate vendors

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor, you can connect those vendors to the item. Use the **Vendors** action on the **Item Card** page to open the **Item Vendor Catalog** page. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant item, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Vendors** action.  
4. Choose the **No.** field, and then select the vendor that you want to set up for the item.  
5. Optionally, fill in the remaining fields.  
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each vendor that you want to buy the item from.

The vendors appear on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, which you open from the item card, so that you can easily select an alternate vendor.

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor additionally you can set up prices and discounts discounts.  For more information, see [Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Manage inventory in warehouses

When you register a new item, you see fields that are related to warehouse management, especially on the **Warehouse** FastTab. If your organization doesn't use the warehouse management capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then you can ignore those fields.  

If your organization later sets up warehouse management, we recommend that you make sure that each existing item has the right information in the various fields. This way, the warehouse processes can run as expected. The information can includes fields such as **Warehouse Class Code** or **Put-away Template Code**. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Planning

When your company uses the supply planning processes in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must fill in the relevant fields on the **Planning** FastTab. For an introduction to the planning area, see [Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md).  

For examples of how you can use the fields on the **Planning** FastTab, see [Setup Best Practices: Planning Parameters](setup-best-practices-planning-parameters.md).  

## Delete item cards

If you post a transaction for an item, you can't delete the card because the ledger entries might be needed for inventory valuation or auditing. To delete item cards with ledger entries, contact to Microsoft partner to do so through code.

# Sustainability Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w2](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

The Sustainability Power BI app provides detailed insight into the emission usage of an organization to support Environment Social Governance (ESG) reporting. The report helps identify key areas to change. The app provides various reports that focus on areas that organizations want to track, such as [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md), [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) and [Social Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=37091).

## Sustainability analytics

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- Sustainability Manager
- Data Analyst

### Example scenario: The sustainability team needs to review their water and waste usage over a period

As someone on the Sustainability team, you want to consistently review your water and waste usage at specific facilities. Using the [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md) report, you can review the capacity at each facility and location to understand the available capacity, should you need it in the future.

:::image type="content" source="media\sustainability\water-waste-by-loc-fac.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Water and Waste Analysis Snippet Power BI" lightbox="media\sustainability\water-waste-by-loc-fac.png":::

The report also allows the team to track different water and waste types along with the YOY and DOD change to ensure they're moving in the right direction.

## Sustainability analytics for the Executive team

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- CEO
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Sustainability Officer

### Example scenario: Ensure targets are being met

For someone on the executive team, you need to ensure targets you put in place for the organization are being met. The [Realized Emissions vs. Target](sustainability-powerbi-realized-emissions-vs-target.md) report can quickly and efficiently compare your actual emissions with your target and make informed decisions about where to make changes.

:::image type="content" source="media\sustainability\co2e-comparision.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Realized Emissions vs Target Snippet Power BI" lightbox="media\sustainability\co2e-comparision.png":::

You can compare the data in this report with the [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) report to ensure your organization is on the right track.

For an executive looking for a quick, high-level view for their organization, you can use the [Sustainability Overview](sustainability-powerbi-sustainability-overview.md) report.

## Alternative use cases

While the reports benefit these examples, in some scenarios other roles can also use this report pack. For example, a Procurement Manager might use the [Emissions by Category and Scope](sustainability-powerbi-emissions-by-category-and-scope.md) report to review Scope 3 so they can identify better vendors. Or, a member of the Human Resources team can use the [Social Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-social-analysis.md) report to get a view of employee activities.

# Handle vendor payment disputes

You can mark a vendor ledger entry as **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document. The on hold status helps you maintain transparency and efficiency while you manage and resolve the issue.

## To set a vendor ledger entry on hold

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor ledger entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to mark.
3. Choose **Edit List**. You can now enter up to 3 characters (likely your initials) in the **On Hold** field to indicate the document is on hold. 

## On hold entries, and the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job

The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [Suggest vendor payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).


## Analyzing On hold vendor ledger entries 

There are multiple other options for analyzing entries on hold. 

For instance, on the **Vendor ledger entries** page you can set a filter on the **On Hold** field to this value
``` Filter
<>''
```


You can also take the vendor ledger entries list page into analysis mode and define an analysis tab. To learn more, go to
[Using data analysis to show vendor ledger entries on hold](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold)


Or you can run the [Payments on Hold](reports/report-319.md) report.

## Block vendors

You can also block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor for purchase documents, or so that they can't post payments to the vendor.

To learn more, go to [Block vendors](payables-how-block-vendors.md).

# Privacy Notices Status in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

This article discusses what a privacy notice is and explains the purpose of the **Privacy Notices Status** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You'll also learn how administrators can use this page.

## Privacy notice

A privacy notice states the data collection, data processing, and data privacy policies followed by the organizations's data controller. It's a document that describes what data is collected and for what purposes, how the user's data is processed, how it's being stored, and who to contact if a user wants to ask something about their data. 

## Privacy Notices Status page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if users want to integrate their data with Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams, they must accept the privacy notice for each entity. Or an admin can approve the privacy notices on their behalf. Admins can see the status of privacy notices on the **Privacy Notices Status** page. You can find the **Privacy Notices Status** page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by typing the name of the page in the search bar.  

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options for each of the services mentioned above. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **Agree for All** | An admin approves the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Disagree for All** | An admin does not approve the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Let User Decide** | Users decide to approve the privacy notice for the service or not. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can only view the status of privacy notices on the main **Privacy Notices Status** page. To edit the responses, go to **Edit List** on the action bar of the page where options are now clickable and not greyed out.

## Privacy Notice Approvals

Admins can see individual approvals and manage them on the **Privacy Notice Approvals** subpage. Go to the *Action* bar of the **Privacy Notices Action** page, under *Actions*, to find the *Show individual approvals* option. This option goes to the **Privacy Notice Approvals** page.<br>

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **User Name** | The user who holds this approval. If *Organization* is written in the User Name column, approval belongs to the whole organization. 
| **Agree** | The user approves the privacy notice. |
| **Disagree** | The user does not approve the privacy notice. |
| **Approver User Name** | The one who approves the privacy notice. |

# The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension

This extension is included in the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide to help you migrate important business data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when your business is growing, and you've decided to upgrade your business management app by starting to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What data can I import from QuickBooks Online?

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Customers
* Vendors
* Items
* Chart of accounts
* Beginning balance transaction in the general ledger
* On-hand quantities for inventory items
* Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos, and payments

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:  

* The sale of items or services to customers.
* The purchase of items or services from vendors.  
* Adjustments in the general ledger.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks Online.

If transactions in QuickBooks Online have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you can post transactions.

## How do I start using the extension?

Getting started is easy. All you need to do is run the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide. Here's how:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Migrate business data**.
2. Follow the instructions on each step in the assisted setup guide.

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status **Unposted**, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the **Sales Invoices** page. To review payment journals, go to the **Payment Journals** page.  

There are a few things in particular that you should do:

* If the transactions in QuickBooks Online had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you post them.
* If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
* Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks Online does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Reconcile customer payments from a list of unpaid sales documents

After customers make electronic payments to your bank account, you must take the following actions:

* Apply each paid amount to the related sales document.
* Post the payment to update the customer, general ledger, and bank ledger entries.

Depending on your business needs, you can register payments manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can do the same tasks, including vendor payments, on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. For example, you can import bank statements, use automatic application, and reconcile bank accounts. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Use the **Register Customer Payments** page to balance internal accounts by using actual cash figures to ensure that payments are collected. You can quickly verify and post individual or lump-sum payments, process discounted payments, and find the unpaid documents.

You must post payments for different customers that have different payment dates as individual payments. Payments for the same customer that have the same payment date can be posted as a lump-sum payment. Lump-sum payments are useful, for example, when a customer made a single payment that covers multiple sales invoices.

## To set up the payment registration journal

Because you can post different payment types to different balancing accounts, you must select a balancing account on the **Payment Registration Setup** page before you start processing customer payments. If you always post to the same balancing account, you can set that account as the default and avoid this step every time that you open the **Register Customer Payments** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link. You can also choose the **Setup** action on the **Register Customer Payments** page.
2. Fill in the fields on the **Payment Registration Setup** page. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to later identify entries that were posted through the journal, you can assign a specific number series to the payment journal. The number series is useful if you use payment reconciliation journals to register and apply payments.

## To register customer payments individually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **Register Customer Payments** page shows all posted documents for which a payment can be registered. You can also open the page from the **Customers** and **Customer Card** pages, filtered for the specified customer.  
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the line that represents the posted document for which a payment was made.
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

   If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter the amount that was paid.

    For full payments, this amount is the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line. For partial payments, this amount is lower than the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines for posted documents for which payments are made.  
6. Choose the **Post Payments** action.  

The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payments entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.

## To reconcile lump-sum payments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the lines for posted documents for the same customer and for which a lump-sum payment was made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The customer in the **Name** field must be the same on all lines to include in the lump-sum payment.  

    If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This date must be the same on all lines that will be posted as a lump-som payment.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter amounts on multiple lines that sum up to the lump payment amount.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Try to post as many full payments as possible with the lump-sum amount. Enter amounts that are the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on as many lines as possible.  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines that represent posted documents for the same customer for which a lump-sum payment was made.  
6. Choose the **Post As Lump Payment** action.

   The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payment entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts. Each payment is applied to the related posted sales document.  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, it might be because the related document isn't posted. In that case, you can use a search function to quickly find the document and post it to process the payment. For more information, see [To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced](#to-find-a-specific-sales-document-that-isnt-fully-invoiced).  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved. For more information, see [To record or post a payment without a related document](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-record-or-post-a-payment-without-a-related-document).  

## To process customer payments with discounts manually

If you agree on a payment discount with your customer, payment amounts can be lower than the invoice amounts if payment occurs before the agreed discount date.  

The following procedures explain ways to post discounted payments on the **Payment Registration** page.  

* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, and the payment date is before the discount date. You post the payment as is.  
* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, but the payment date is after the discount date. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount. You can also set the discount date later to allow the payment in full.  
* The payment amount is lower than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount.  
* The payment amount is more than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payments as is. Only the remaining amount is posted. The extra amount is credited to the customer.  

### To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount and where the payment date is before the discount date

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.

5. Choose the **Post Payments** action to post the full payment to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.  

The related document is closed, and the customer is credited the excess payment amount.  

## To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced

The **Register Customer Payments** page supports you in tasks needed to balance internal accounts with actual cash figures to ensure effective collection from customers. It shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment.  

Typically, when a payment is made, recorded in the bank or otherwise, the sales or purchase document is represented as a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page. The document is waiting for you to post the payment to the outstanding amount. However, sometimes a payment that was made isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, typically because the document isn't fully invoiced.

Use the **Search Documents** action to search for documents that aren't fully invoiced. You can search based on one or more of the following criteria:  

* Document number  
* Amount or amount range  

The following procedure explains how to find a specific document by using both search criteria.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. With the pointer on any line, Choose the **Search Documents** action.
3. On the **Document Search** page, enter a search value in the **Document No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The value that you enter in this field is enclosed in hidden wildcard characters. This means that the action searches for all document numbers that contain the entered value.
4. In the **Amount** field, enter the specific amount on the document you want to find.  
5. In the **Amount Tolerance %** field, enter a percentage value to define the range of amounts that you want to search to find the open document.  

    If you enter 10, the action searches for amounts in a range of plus or minus 10 percent of the value in the **Amount** field.
6. Choose the **Search** action.  

If one or more documents match the criteria, the **Document Search Result** page opens to display lines that represent those documents. Each line contains a document number, description, and an amount.

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the  open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

## To record or post a payment without a related document

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the **General Journal** action to open a prefilled general journal line from the **Register Customer Payments** page. Use the journal to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **General Journal** action.  

    The **General Journal** page opens with one line that contains the balancing account of the journal batch that is set up on the **Payment Registration Setup** page.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the general journal line. For example, provide the amount, customer number, or information from the bank statement. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

You can post the journal line to update the total on the balancing account. You can also leave the journal line unposted, and perhaps append it with a note that the payment needs more analysis.  

If you don't post the journal line, its value is added to the value in the **Rem. Amount Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Registration** page.

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

This extension uses the Computer Vision API from Azure Cognitive Services, which may have varying levels of compliance commitments than [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you enable the Image Analyzer extension, Customer Data such as a contact image or an item image will be sent to the Computer Vision API. By installing this extension, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the Computer Vision API. Note that you may disable, and uninstall, the Image Analyzer extension at any time to discontinue use of this functionality. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851463).

# Walkthrough: Make cash flow forecasts using financial reports

This walkthrough describes how you can use the financial reports feature to make cash flow forecasts. Financial reports perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the financial reports, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used to make cash flow forecasts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the following tasks:  

- Setting up a new cash flow financial report name.  
- Setting up financial report lines.  
- Setting up a new column definition.  
- Assigning a column definition to a financial report.  
- Viewing and printing the cash flow forecast.  

### Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A cash flow worksheet with registered lines  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user role:  

- Controller  

## Story

Ken is a controller at CRONUS who makes monthly cash flow forecasts. Ken includes finance, sales, purchase, and fixed assets in the forecasts, and presents to CFO Sara for business insight.  

## Set up a new financial report name

The financial report name is the name you give the cash flow forecast that includes a series of defined lines and a column definition.  

### Set up a new financial report name

    > [!NOTE]
    > The row number R10 is used to capture the account totals for receivables. The row number R20 is used to calculate the sum of all cash receipts. The row number R30 is used to capture the account totals for payables. The row number R40 is used to calculate the sum of all cash disbursements. The row number R50 is used to capture the sum of cash surplus. The row number R60 is used to capture the liquid funds. The row number R70 is used to calculate the forecasted cash flow.

## Set up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|

## Assig the column definition to the financial report name

Ken is now ready to assign the column definition to the financial report name.  

### Assign the column definition to the financial report name

1. In the **Financial Reports** page, select the **Forecast** financial report, then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.  
2. In the **Name** field, choose the column definition **Cash Flow** to assign as the default column definition.  

## View and print the cash flow forecast

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **Forecast** financial report [Financial analytics overview](bi.md)  to view the cash flow forecast.  
2. On the **Financial Report** page, you can select an amount and then view the cash flow forecast entries that make up the amount. In addition, you can view the formula used to calculate that amount. You can also filter the amounts by date and dimension.  
3. Choose the **Print** action to print the cash flow forecast.

# Inventory Overview (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory Overview** report provides a high-level summary of your inventory. It shows key metrics, such as:

- Inventory (Quantity)
- Scheduled receipts
- Gross requirements
- Project available balance

The report can give you a high-level understanding of your inventory on a location by location basis, along with quantities across different types of documents.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management can gauge inventory levels across locations and get an idea about requirements versus receipts.

Management teams use the report to paint a picture of the stock information without having to drill down. The report gives a clear view of stock you're receiving and the demand that's currently in the system.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory Overview* report includes the following KPIs:

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Set Up Multiple Interest Rates for Delayed Payment

You can use different interest rates for different periods for delayed payments in trade transactions. [!INCLUDE [multiple-interest-rates-def](includes/multiple-interest-rates-def.md)]

For example, a government specifies the maximum interest to be levied for a consumer. This interest rate can be changed twice a year on 01 January and 01 July. The interest rate between businesses (B2B) is agreed by the parties and there is no limit to that customer group. The announced rate is usually four percent more than the normal bank interest.

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.  

## To set up multiple interest rates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Finance Charge Terms** page, select the required finance term, and then choose the **Interest Rates** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the required reminder term, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
7. On the **Reminder Levels** page, for the relevant reminder levels, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  

When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.

# Set up prepayments

You use prepayments when:

* You require your customers to submit payment before you ship an order to them.
* Your vendor requires that you submit payment before they ship an order to you.

Prepayments let you invoice and collect deposits from customers or to remit deposits to vendors, to ensure that all partial payments are posted against an invoice. For more information, see [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).

Before you can post prepayment invoices, you have to set up the posting accounts in the general ledger, and you have to set up number series for prepayment documents. You must specify an account for prepayments related to sales and an account for prepayments related to purchasing. You can specify the same posting accounts for all prepayments related to all general business posting groups or general product posting groups. You can also specify specific accounts for specific posting groups for sales and purchasing, respectively. The best method to use depends on your company's requirements for tracking prepayments.  

You can define the percentage of the line amount to invoice for prepayment for a customer or vendor, and for all or selected items. After you complete the setup, you can generate prepayment invoices from sales and purchase orders. You can use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or you can change the amounts on the invoice as needed. For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you don't use a prepayment percentage of 100 in the following cases:
>
> * You're located in North America. Due to how taxes are calculated, a prepayment percentage of 100 can lead to issues with prepayment invoices.
> * In all regions, if you manually deduct a payment discount from the invoice. A prepayment percentage of 100 doesn't automatically leave an amount from which to deduct the discount.

> Also, when you're using prepayment percentage of 100, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might need to create off-setting rounding entries. When that happens, choose a G/L account in the **Invoice Rounding Account** field on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. This account is required even if you don't turn on the **Invoice Rounding** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. If you don't specify an account, you can't post prepayment invoices.

The prepaid amount belongs to the buyer until they receive the goods or services. You must set up general ledger accounts to hold the prepayment amounts until you post the final invoice. Sales prepayments must be recorded in an account for liabilities until the items ship. Purchase prepayments must be recorded in an account for assets until the items are received. In addition, you must set up a separate general ledger account for each VAT identifier.  

[!INCLUDE[local-func-setup-link](includes/local-func-setup-link.md)]

## To add prepayment accounts to the general posting setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, for the relevant lines, fill in the following fields:  

    * **Sales Prepayments Account**  
    * **Purch. Prepayments Account**  

If you don't already have general ledger accounts for prepayments, you can open the **G/L Account List** page from the relevant account field.  

## To set up number series for prepayment documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:  

   * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
   * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:

    * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
    * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the same number series for prepayment invoices and regular invoices, or you can use different number series. If you use different series, they must not overlap because there must not be any numbers that exist in both series.  

## To set up prepayment percentages for items, customers, and vendors

For an item, you can set up a default prepayment percentage for all customers, a specific customer, or a customer price group. If you don't want to apply the same prepayment percentage to all customers, you must specify which customers or which customer price groups the prepayment percentage applies to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an item, and then choose the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For a customer or vendor, you can set up one default prepayment percentage for all items and all types of sales lines. You enter the percentage on the customer or vendor card. The following procedure shows how to specify a prepayment percentage for a customer, but similar steps apply to vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a customer.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, fill in the **Prepayment %** field.
4. Repeat the steps for other customers or for vendors.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page from the customer or vendor card.

### To determine which prepayment percentage has first priority  

An order might have a prepayment percentage on the sales header, and a different percentage for the items on the lines. To determine which prepayment percentage applies to each sale line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for and applies the first default percentage in the following order:  

1. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer that the order is for.  
2. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer price group that the customer belongs to.  
3. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line for all customers.  
4. The prepayment percentage on the sales or purchase header.  

In other words, the prepayment percentage on the customer card only applies if no prepayment percentage is set for the item. However, if you change the contents of the **Prepayment Percentage** field on the sales or purchase header after you create the lines, the prepayment percentage on all of the lines update. The update makes it easy to create an order with a fixed prepayment percentage, regardless of the percentage set on items.

## To automatically release sales orders when prepayments are applied

You can save time by setting up a job queue entry that will automatically release sales orders that require prepayment after payments are applied. Automating the process saves you the step of releasing the sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Prepmt. Auto Update Frequency** field, specify how often you want the job queue entry to run.

> [!TIP]
> While you're here, consider adding a safeguard against shipping or invoicing sales orders that have unpaid prepayment amounts. If you turn on the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents people from posting orders with outstanding prepayment amounts.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
4. Set up the **Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** job queue entry, for example, by using the settings on the **Recurrence** FastTab to schedule how often you want it to run. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Set the layout used by a report

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online, Business Central on-premises 2022 release wave 1 and later. For earlier versions, go [here](ui-how-change-layout-currently-used-report.md).

A report layout determines the look of a report. It controls which data fields of a report dataset appear, how they're arranged, styled, and more. A report may have more than one layout, which you can then switch among as needed.

When there are multiple companies in the application, the layouts are set on a per-company basis. So the same report in one company can have a different layout in another company.

## Get started

There are a few ways to set which layout a report uses. Each way has advantages, depending on what you're looking to do: 

- From the report request page

  When setting up a report to run, the report request page includes the **Reports Layout** field that shows the current default layout used by the report. You can use this field to temporarily switch to another available layout the report you're running. After you run the report, the layout will revert to the default layout again. For more information, see [Run and Print Reports](ui-work-report.md#switch-the-report-layout).

- From the **Report Layout Selection** page

  The **Report Layout Selection** page displays a list of all reports. This page indicates what the current default layout for a report is. It lets you set layouts in different companies, without having to switch the company you're working with.

- From the **Report Layouts** page
  The **Report Layouts** page displays all available layouts for each report in the current company. It's also used to specify the default layout for reports. It's easy to find a specific layout by sorting or filtering the list. Once you find the layout, you can set it for a report with a single selection.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can't use the **Report Layouts** page for Word and RDLC layouts that were created by using the legacy **Custom Layouts** feature. In fact, you won't even see these custom layouts listed on the **Report Layouts** page. For these layouts, you can only set them by using **Report Layout Selection** page.

## Set the layout from the Report Layouts page

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Find the layout in the list, select it, then select the **Set Default** action at the top of the page.

## Set the layout from Report Layout Selection page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** field specifies the layout that the report currently uses.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top to the company that includes the report.
3. Find and select the report in the list, then do one of the following steps:

   - If the layout that you want to switch to is a different type than the current layout, select the **Layout Type** field, then choose the type of the layout you want to set on the report. 
   - If the layout that you want to switch to the same type as the current layout, select the **Select Layout** action at the top.

4. In the **Report Layouts** page, select the layout, then select **OK**.

## Revert to the original default layout

Reports are designed to use a layout by default. You can switch back to the original default layout from **Report Layout Selection** page. Just select the report, then select the **Restore Default Selection** action at the top of the page.

# Calculate order promising dates

A company must be able to inform their customers of order delivery dates. The **Order Promising Lines** page enables you to do this from a sales order.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates shipment and delivery dates based on an item’s known and expected availability dates, which you can promise to customers.  

If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations:  

- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date  

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. If the items aren't available to be picked on the shipment date, then a stock-out warning is displayed.  

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following calculations:  

- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date  

## About order promising

The Order Promising functionality enables you to promise an order to be shipped or delivered on a specific date. The date that an item is available to promise or capable to promise is calculated, and order lines are created for those dates that you accept. The functionality calculates the earliest possible date that an item is available for shipment or delivery. It also creates requisition lines, in case the items must first be purchased or produced, for those dates that you accept.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses two fundamental concepts:  

- Available to Promise (ATP)  
- Capable to Promise (CTP)  

### Available to promise

Available to promise (ATP) calculates dates based on the reservation system. It performs an availability check of the unreserved quantities in inventory about planned production, purchases, transfers, and sales returns. Based on this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the delivery date of the customer’s order because the items are available, either in inventory or on planned receipts.  

### Capable to promise

Capable to promise (CTP) assumes a “what if” scenario, which only applies to item quantities that aren't in inventory or on scheduled orders. Based on this scenario, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the earliest date that the item can be available if it's to be produced, purchased, or transferred.

#### Example

If there's an order for 10 pieces, and 6 pieces are available in inventory or on scheduled orders, then the capable to promise calculation will be based on 4 pieces.

### Calculations

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the customer’s delivery date, it performs two tasks:  

- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer hasn't requested a specific delivery date.  
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic.  

If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, the shipment date is set to equal the work date, and availability is then based on that date. If the item is in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates forward in time to determine when the order can be delivered. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then verifies if the calculated delivery date is realistic by calculating backward in time to determine when the item must be available to meet the promised date. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date  

The shipment date is used to make the availability check. If the item is available on this date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] confirms that the requested/promised delivery can be met by setting the planned delivery date to equal the requested/promised delivery date. If the item is unavailable, it returns a blank date and the order processor can then use the CTP functionality.  

Based on new dates and times, all related dates are calculated according to the formulas listed earlier in this section. The CTP calculation takes longer but it gives an accurate date when the customer can expect to have the item delivered. The dates that are calculated from CTP are presented in the **Planned Delivery Date** and **Earliest Shipment Date** fields on the **Order Promising Lines** page.  

The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates. This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled.  

In addition to the external order promising that you can perform on the **Order Promising Lines** page, you can also promise internal or external delivery dates for bill-of-material items. For more information, see [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).

## To set up order promising

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Promising Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter a number and time unit code in the **Offset(Time)** field. Select one of the following codes.  

    |Code|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**d**|Calendar day|  
    |**w**|Week|  
    |**m**|Month|  
    |**q**|Quarter|  
    |**y**|Year|  

    For example, "3w" indicates that the offset time is three weeks. To indicate the current period, prefix to any of these codes with the letter “c”. For example, if you want the offset time to be the current month, enter **cm**.  
3. Enter a number series in the **Order Promising Nos.** field by selecting a line from the list on the **No. Series** page.  
4. Enter an order promising template in the **Order Promising Template** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Worksheet Template List** page.  
5. Enter a requisition worksheet in the **Order Promising Worksheet** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Wksh. Names** page.

### Inbound and outbound warehouse handling times in order promising

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, on the **Inventory Setup** page you can specify a default handling time to use on sales and purchase documents. You can also enter specific times for each of your locations on the **Location Card** page. 

#### To enter default inbound and outbound warehouse handling times for sales and purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to include in the order promising calculations.  

#### To enter inbound and outbound warehouse handling times on locations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant location card.  
3.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to be included in the order promising calculations.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you are creating a purchase order, if you choose **Location** in the **Ship-to** field on the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab, and then choose a location in the **Location Code** field, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will use the handling time specified for the location. For sales orders, the same is true if you choose a location in the **Location Code** field. If no handling time is specified for the location, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will be blank. If you leave the **Location Code** field blank on sales and purchase documents, the calculation uses the handling time specified on the **Inventory Setup**  page.

## To make an item critical

Before an item can be included in the order promising calculation, it must be marked as critical. This setup ensures that non-critical items don't cause irrelevant order promising calculations.   
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Critical** field.  

## To calculate an order promising date

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant sales order and select the sales order lines that you want application to calculate.  
3.  Choose the **Order Promising** action, and then choose the **Order Promising Lines** action.  
4.  Select a line, and then select one of the following options:  

    - Select **Available-to-Promise** if you want to calculate the earliest date that the item will be available with respect to inventory, scheduled receipts, and gross requirements.  
    - Select **Capable-to-Promise** if you know that the item is presently out of stock and you want to calculate the earliest date that the item can be available by issuing new replenishment requisitions.  
5.  Choose the **Accept** button to accept the earliest shipment date available.

# Bin Contents (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Bin Contents** report breaks down an organization's inventory levels on a bin-by-bin basis. Use this information to identify high and low volume bins and inform inventory movement requirements if bins need more inventory.

The report also shows the available quantity and quantity metrics across different warehouse activities. For example, picks, put-aways, and general adjustments.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/bin-contents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Bin Contents Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/bin-contents.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps managers and manufacturing or procurement staff to identify item volumes in each bin.

For warehouse or inventory managers, the report provides a clear picture of the stock levels of each bin across your organization. The report can help you make decisions on procurement or production. It might also prompt you to transfer stock to a specific bin to maintain supply.

Manufacturing team members can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan production schedules based on the inventory in each bin.

The procurement team can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan purchase orders to ensure that quantities in bins stay at a reasonable level.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Bin Contents* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity in Adjustment Bin**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity-in-adjustment-bin)
- [**Available Quantity to Take**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#available-qty-to-take)

# Search for a record in company data

When you want to find a particular record or value, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to look for it. Learn more about searching in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Finding Pages and Information with Tell Me](ui-search.md).

## How search works

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Getting started

You can speed up results by choosing the fields on the tables that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

When demand is planned for and the materials are issued according to production BOMs, production operations can start in the sequence defined by the production order routing.  

An important part of production, from a system point of view, is to post production output to report progress and to update inventory with the finished items. You can post output manually, by filling in and posting journal lines after production operations. Or, it can post automatically with the use of backward flushing. In that case, material consumption is automatically posted along with output when the production order changes to finished.  

As an alternative to the batch journal for output posting for multiple production orders, you can use the **Production Journal** page to post consumption and/or output for one production order line.

There are a few things to set up before you can start production. For example, work centers, routings, and production BOMs. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Manufacturing](production-configure-production-processes.md).

# Process sales return orders  

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

## Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Sales Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted sales invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to return that quantity on a new sales return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    -   For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    -   For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    -   Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    -   If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
     >   
     >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted sales credit memo line for a new sales credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Sales Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **post** action.

## To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
You might decide to compensate a customer for an item that you have sold them by replacing the item. You can make a replacement with the same item or a different item. This situation could occur if you mistakenly shipped the wrong item to the customer, for example.  

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.
3. On the **Move Negative Sales Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line for the replacement item is deleted from the sales return order and inserted in a new **Sales Order** page. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To create return-related documents from a sales return order
You can have replacement sales orders, purchase return orders, and replacement purchase orders created automatically during the sales return process. This is useful, for example, in situations where you want to handle items with warranties provided by vendors.

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, choose the **Create Return-Related Documents** action.
2. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the number of a vendor if you want to create vendor documents automatically.
3. If a returned item must be returned to the vendor, select the **Create Purch. Ret. Order** check box.
4. If a returned item must be ordered from the vendor, select the **Create Purchase Order** check box.
5. If a replacement sales order must be created, select the **Create Sales Order** check box.

## To create a restock charge
You might decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item. This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them, for example.

You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes this for a sales return order, but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo.

1. Open the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process.
2. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
3. Fill in the fields as for any item charge line. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).  

When you post the sales return order, the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Assembly Management

Companies can supply products to customers by combining components without using manufacturing features. Features for assembling items integrate with related features such as sales, planning, reservations, and warehousing.  

An assembly item is a sellable item that contains an assembly BOM. To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md).

Assembly orders are internal orders, just like production orders. Use assembly orders to manage the assembly process and to connect sales requirements with warehouse activities. Assembly orders involve both output and consumption when posting. Assembly order headers are similar to output journal lines. Assembly order lines are similar to consumption journal lines.  

You can use a just-in-time inventory strategy and customize products to meet customer requests. Assembly orders can be automatically created and linked when you create a sales order line. The link between the sales demand and assembly supply opens up for several opportunities when you process sales orders:

* Customize assembly items on the fly.
* Promise delivery dates according to component availability.
* Post output and shipment of the assembled item directly from their sales orders.

To learn more about selling assembly items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

Lines on sales orders can contain items to pick from stock and items to assemble for the order. The assemble-to-order quantities take priority over inventory quantities in partial shipping. To learn more about selling stock and assembly items, go to [Combination Scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

When an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to ship, a warehouse employee can post an inventory pick for the sales order lines. Posting an inventory pick does a couple of things:

* Create an inventory movement for the components
* Post the assembly output and the sales order shipment.

To learn more about assemble-to-order items and inventory picks, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

# Manage and reconcile your bank accounts

A bank reconciliation should be completed at regular intervals for all your bank accounts to ensure that the company's cash records are correct. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

You can perform the task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page where you match (reconcile) bank statement lines in the left-hand pane with your internal bank account ledger entries in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page as part of processing the payments that are represented on a bank statement. On both pages, you can fill in the bank statement information by importing a file or feed and you can use automatic matching suggestions.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the North American versions, you can also perform bank reconciliation on the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, deselect the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

Before you can manage your bank accounts within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up each bank account as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Setting Up Banking](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
| Reconcile bank accounts as a separate task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |[Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md) |
| Reconcile bank accounts in connection with payment processing on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. |[Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Use bank reconciliation to help verify that your books are up-to-date, and do not post the reconciliation until you are satisfied with the reconciliation.

# Walkthrough: Set up and invoicing sales prepayments

This walkthrough takes you through the process of setting up and using prepayments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can send more prepayment invoices if more items are added to the order.  

## About this walkthrough  

This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios:  

- Setting up prepayments  
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment  
- Creating a prepayment invoice  
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order  
- Applying prepayments to an order  
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment  

### Roles

This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Accounting Manager (Phyllis)  
- Order Processor (Susan)  
- Accounts Receivable Administrator (Arnie)  

## Story

 Phyllis is an accounting manager and makes decisions about which customers are required to pay a deposit before items are manufactured or shipped. Phyllis sets up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate prepayments automatically.  

 Susan is a sales order processor. When a customer calls to place an order, Susan enters the order into the system while the customer is on the telephone. This way, Susan can verify prices and payment terms with the customer immediately, and make changes to the order while negotiating with the customer.  

 Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department and posts invoices and payments.  

 In this scenario, Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian based on their credit history. Phyllis gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders.  

 When the customer calls, Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement, and then chooses to calculate the prepayment in several different ways.  

 After Susan sends the prepayment invoice, the customer orders an extra item. Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice.  

 Arnie registers the customer's payment and applies it to the invoices, and then sends the final invoice.  

## Set up prepayments

Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers.  

- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing.  
- Phyllis sets application to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order.  
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers.  

The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis' tasks:  

### To set up number series for prepayments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, expand the **Number Series** FastTab.  
3. Verify that the number series for posted prepayment invoices in the **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.** field is the same as for posted sales invoices (**Posted Invoice Nos.**), and the number series for posted prepayment credit memos (**Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**) is the same as for posted credit memos (**Posted Credit Memo Nos.**).  

### To block shipments for unpaid prepayment

1. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Check Prepayment when Posting** check box.

Now you can't ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount.  

By default, Phyllis requires customer 20000 to be invoiced for a 30% down payment on all orders. Therefore, Phyllis will enter a default prepayment percentage on the customer card.  

Phyllis requires all customers to be invoiced a 20% deposit for item 1896-S. Customer 20000 has a poor payment history, so Phyllis requires a 40% prepayment from customer 20000 for item 1896-S. The following procedure illustrates how to set up default prepayment percentages.  

### To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for customer 20000 (Trey Research).
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **30**.  
4. Choose the **Related** action, select the **Sales** menu item, and then choose the **Prepayment Percentages** menu item.  
5. Fill in two lines on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page as follows.  

    |**Sales Type**|**Sales Code**|**Item No.**|**Prepayment %**|  
    |--------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|  
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1896-S**|**40**|
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1900-S**|**30**|  
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Depending on your country/region, you must also specify a tax group code on the **Costs & Posting** FastTab for item 1896-S. When you use the demonstration company, this field is already set.

6. Close all pages.  

### To specify an account for sales prepayments in general posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line where the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field is set to **DOMESTIC**, and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field is set to **RETAIL**.  
3. In the **Sales Prepayments Account** field, specify the relevant account. Your selection is automatically saved.  

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the field in the **General Posting Setup** page, then use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

## Create an order that requires a prepayment

 In the following scenario, Susan, the order processor, creates an order when talking to a customer. The items the customer is ordering require a prepayment. Plus, the customer has made some late payments in the past. Susan's been instructed to require a fixed amount of **800** as a prepayment on the order.  

The customer asks to pay 35%, to which Susan agrees and changes the order.  

Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a sales order with a prepayment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Customer Name** field, choose **Trey Research**.  
4. Close the overdue balance warning that is displayed.  
5. Fill in two sales lines with the following information.  

    |**Type**|**No.**|**Quantity**|  
    |--------------|-------------|------------------|  
    |**Item**|**1896-S**|**1**|  
    |**Item**|**1900-S**|**1**|

    By default, the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden. To display the fields, you must personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

6. Verify that the **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1900-S** contains **30**. The default value was taken from the sales header, which was populated from the customer card.  

    The **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1896-S** contains **40**. 40 is the percentage you entered on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page for item **1896-S** and customer **20000**.  

    For more information, see [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).  
7. In the **Order** action, choose  **Statistics**.  
8. On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field contains **458.16**. If you create a prepayment invoice for the order now, 458.16 is the amount on the invoice.  

    In this scenario, Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of **800** for the order.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Depending on your country/region, the following step might not apply.  
9. Change the amount in the **Prepmt. Amount Excl. Tax** field to **800** and then close the page.  
10. Verify the **Prepayment %** field on the sales lines, and you'll see that it has been recalculated to **67.02438** and **67.02282**.  

     The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0.  

     Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35%. Susan's supervisor approves the change.
11. On the **Sales Order** page, on the **Prepayment** FastTab in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **35**.  
12. In the warning that appears, choose the **Yes** button. A rate of 35% will be applied as the payment percentage for the whole order.  
13. Verify that the lines have been updated correctly.  

## Create a prepayment invoice

After entering the correct prepayment values on the order, Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
2. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Susan would now send the invoice to the customer.  

## Create an additional prepayment invoice

The following day, the customer calls Susan and makes changes to the order. The customer wants two of item 1896-S. Susan reopens the order, updates it, and then creates a second prepayment invoice for the order and sends it to the customer.  

### To create an additional prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose the **Release** action, and then **Reopen**.  
2. On the line for item **1896-S**, in the **Quantity** field, enter **2**.  

    In the **Order** action, choose **Statistics**. The **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field now contains **768.04**, and the **Prepmt. Amt. Invoiced Excl. VAT** field contains **417.76**. These values show that there's an extra prepayment amount that hasn't been invoiced yet.  
3. To post an invoice for the extra prepayment amount, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
4. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

## Apply the prepayments

The customer pays the prepayment amount. Arnie, from the accounting department, registers the payment, and applies it to the prepayment invoices.  

### To apply a payment to the prepayment invoices

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in a journal line with the following information.  

    |Field name|Enter|  
    |----------------|-----------|  
    |**Document Type**|**Payment**|  
    |**Account Type**|**Customer**|  
    |**Account No.**|**20000**|  
3. Choose the **Process** action, and then **Apply Entries**.  
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the first prepayment invoice, and then choose the **Process** action, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
5. Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The **Amount** fields have now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices.  

7. To post the journal, choose the **Post/Print** action, then select **Post**.
8. Choose the **Yes** button.

## Invoice the remaining amount

Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing. Arnie creates the invoice for the order.  

### To invoice the remaining amount

1. Open the sales order.
2. Choose the **Posting** action, then **Post**.
3. Select **Ship and Invoice**, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. If you want to preview the invoice, choose the **Yes** button.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Normally, the shipping department would have already posted the shipment.  

    Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended.

5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Next steps

This walkthrough covered the following steps to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle prepayments. 

- Set up default prepayment percentages on customers and items.
- Use different methods to calculate the prepayments on an order.  
- Calculate the prepayment amount as a percentage of the total on the order.
- Assign one total prepayment amount to the order.  

You've also posted a prepayment invoice, created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed, and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount.  

The prepayments capabilities make it easy to set up and enforce prepayment rules for customers and items. They also let you to post every payment against an invoice.

# Track Relations Between Demand and Supply

From any supply or demand document in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan. For more information, see [Untracked Planning Elements](production-how-track-demand-supply.md#untracked-planning-elements).

## To track linked items
Order tracking shows how sales orders, production orders, and purchase orders are related to the manufacturing order through the planning and reservation systems.

The following describes how to track linked items on a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for all other order types, and from planning worksheet lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant firm planned production order from the list.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.

The lines in the **Order Tracking** display the documents that are related to the current production order line.

## Untracked Planning Elements
The **Untracked Planning Elements** page opens when you choose the **Untracked Qty.** field on the **order Planning** page. It serves two purposes:

1. To hold information about untracked quantities displayed when the user looks up from the Order Tracking page to see untracked quantities.
2. To hold warning messages displayed when the user chooses the **Warning** icon on the **Planning Worksheet** page.

The page contains entries which account for an untracked surplus quantity in order tracking network. These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# About cost accounting

Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business. Cost accounting information is designed to analyze:  

- What types of costs your business incurs.  
- Where the costs occur.
- Who bears the costs.

In cost accounting, you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations, departments, products, and projects to analyze the profitability of your company.  

## Workflow in cost accounting

Cost accounting has the following main components:  

- Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects  
- Cost entries and cost journals  
- Cost allocations  
- Cost budgets
- Cost reporting  

The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting.  

![Cost Accounting overview.](media/costaccountingoverview.png "CostAccountingOverview")  

## Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects

You define cost types, cost centers, and cost objects to analyze what the costs are, where the costs come from, and who should bear the costs.  

First, you define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts. You can create your own chart of cost types or do so by transferring the general ledger income statement accounts.  

Cost centers are departments and profit centers responsible for costs and income. Often, there are more cost centers set up in cost accounting than in any dimension that is set up in the general ledger. In the general ledger, typically only the first level cost centers for direct costs and the initial costs are used. In cost accounting, more cost centers are created for extra allocation levels.  

Cost objects are products, product groups, or services a company offers. These objects are the "finished goods" that carry the costs.  

You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company. Through the general ledger, you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions and supplement that information with subtotals and titles.  

## Cost entries and cost journals

Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger. You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting. You can also use a batch job to transfer general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting.  

In cost journals, you can post cost and activities that don't come from the general ledger or aren't generated by allocations. For example, you can post pure operational costs, internal charges, allocations, and corrective entries between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects individually, or on a recurring basis.  

## Cost allocations

Allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. Overhead costs are first posted to cost centers and later charged to cost objects. An example would be a sales department that sells several products at the same time. The department's overhead costs, such as salaries, supplies, and travel expenses, are initially assigned to the sales cost center. The costs are then allocated between the different products (cost objects) sold, together with the materials purchased (direct cost).

The allocation base and the accuracy of the allocation definition influence the results of cost allocations. The allocation definition allocates costs first from so-called precost centers to main cost centers, and then from cost centers to cost objects.  

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. You can allocate actual values or budgeted values using the static allocation method based on a definite value. For example, square footage, or an established allocation ratio of 5:2:4. You can also allocate actual values or budgeted values by using the dynamic allocation method with nine predefined allocation bases and 12 dynamic date ranges.  

## Cost budgets

Similar to budgeting in the general ledger, you can create budgets to plan for costs during a certain period (a fiscal year, for example), which can be applied to a cost center (company department), or a cost object (product or service). You can create as many cost budgets as you need. You can then copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa. And you can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs.

## Cost reporting

Most reports and statistics are based on the posted cost entries. You can set the sorting of the results and use filters to define which data must be displayed. You can create reports for cost distribution analysis. In addition, you can use the standard financial reports to define how your reports for the chart of cost types are displayed.

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Set up general fixed assets information

Before you can manage fixed assets (FA), you must set up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, and journal templates and batches to post and reclassify fixed assets. Also, define a classification hierarchy (classes and sub classes) to structure your assets and, if needed, define the locations where you store assets.

## To set up general behavior for fixed assets functionality

Define the general behavior of the fixed asset functionality and its document number series on the **Fixed Assets Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To set up fixed asset posting groups

Use posting groups to define groups of fixed assets. Entries for these posting groups post to the same general ledger accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Group Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   To make sure that balancing accounts for different fixed assets postings are automatically inserted when you choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on journal lines, follow the next step, based on appreciation posting.
4. On the **Balancing Account** FastTab, in the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field, select the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation.

For more information about using the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on fixed asset G/L journal lines, see [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).

## To set up fixed asset journal templates

A template is a predefined layout for a journal. The template contains information about trace codes, reports, and number series. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset journal template the first time that you open the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, but you can set up other journal templates.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset class and subclass codes

In fixed assets, you can define a classification hierarchy that can be used to group assets. The hierarchy has two levels: classes and subclasses.

### Fixed asset class codes

Fixed asset classes are the top-level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. For example, use classes to divide assets into tangible or intangible assets. You must create at least one fixed asset class in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Classes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset classes that you want to create.

### Fixed asset subclass codes

Fixed asset subclasses are the second level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. Each subclass points to a top-level class. Use fixed asset subclass codes to group fixed assets in more specific categories, such as buildings, vehicles, furniture, or machinery. You must create at least one fixed asset subclass in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Subclasses**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset subclasses that you want to create.

## Start to register assets

If you're using the fixed assets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, you must set up the general ledger application area before you set up fixed assets. How you do so depends on whether you integrate fixed assets with the general ledger.  

The following procedure is used if fixed asset transactions are to be posted to the general ledger.  

1. Complete the basic setups for fixed assets.  
2. Fill in a fixed asset card for each existing asset.  
3. Create a fixed asset depreciation book for each depreciation purpose (such as tax and financial statements). For each depreciation book, define the terms and conditions, such as integration with the general ledger.

    Enable general ledger integration by following the next steps. First, ensure that general ledger integration isn't enabled for all depreciation books, then post the opening entries, and finally, turn on general ledger integration.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **Depreciation Book Card** page.
6. On the **Integration** FastTab, turn off all of the toggles. If you have more than one depreciation book, repeat this step for each one.  
7. In the fixed asset journal, enter the following lines for each asset:
   * A line with the acquisition cost.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation to the end of the previous fiscal year.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation from the start of the current fiscal year to the date that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set to start calculating the depreciation.

    If you have other opening balances you can also enter them now, such as write-down and appreciation.  
8. After you enter and post the journal lines for each asset, turn on general ledger integration in the
depreciation books.

If the fixed assets aren't integrated with the general ledger, skip steps six and eight.

## To set up fixed asset location codes (optional)

Fixed asset location codes define identifiers for where assets can be located, such as sales department, reception, administration, production, or warehouse. You can use them to register the location of a fixed asset. This information is useful for insurance and inventory purposes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset locations that you want to create.

## To set up fixed asset allocation keys (optional)

Use allocation keys to allocate transactions to various departments or projects. For example, you can set up an allocation key to allocate vehicle depreciation costs with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department. For more information, see [Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md).

Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes, not to individual assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **FA Posting Groups** page, choose the **Allocations** action, and then choose a posting type.
3. On the **FA Allocations** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each posting type that you want to define allocation keys for.

## To set up fixed asset journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each journal template. For example, employees can have their own journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal templates (optional)

Use dedicated reclassification journals to transfer, split, or combine fixed assets. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset reclassification journal template the first time you open the **FA Reclass. Journal** page, but you can set up other reclassification journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each reclassification journal template. For example, employees can have their own reclassification journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the reclassification journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Reclass. Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

# Access Data in Teams without Business Central License

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central license that allows them to view, modify, and act on their business data within Teams. These users can collaborate on data by sharing records into chats or channels, or adding tabs that show records. However, there may be other employees across the organization who don't have a Business Central license but could benefit by being able to view data in Teams. For these users, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers limited access through their Microsoft 365 licenses only.  

As an administrator, you can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses. You can then choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. Once configured, employees who have a Microsoft 365 license, but no Business Central license, can view Business Central records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.

To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 Licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md) and [Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ](admin-access-with-m365-license-faq.md).

# Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods.

To analyze budgeted amounts, you must first create general ledger (G/L) budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## View a G/L budget

In a budget with dimensions, you can filter the entries and see specific budgets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **G/L Budgets** page, open the budget you want to view.  
3. At the top of the page, fill in the fields necessary to define what is shown. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then you must fill in the **View by** field. If you have not selected **Period** in either of those fields, enter the appropriate period in the **Date Filter** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only entries from the general ledger budget with the filter codes you enter on the **Filters** FastTab are included in the calculation. Budget entries without any or with other filter codes are not included. As long as the filter remains on the page, the budget only displays entries with those filter codes.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Edit Budget** action to modify the budget. On the budget page, choose an amount to view the underlying general ledger budget entries.

## View actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts

You can view general ledger budgets and compare them with actual figures in several areas of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. Hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

> [!NOTE]  
> The filters you set on the page header will be applied to both general ledger and budget entries.

The leftmost columns contain the chart of accounts. Of the five columns on the rightmost side, the first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **View by** field on the **G/L Balance/Budget** page to select the period length. Use the **View as** field to select the way the amounts will be calculated, either **Net Change** or **Balance at Date**. Choose the **Previous Period** or **Next Period** action to change the period.

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

## External document number

# Manage permissions through user groups (legacy)

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group applies to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

## Add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To learn how to create user groups automatically, go to [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

## Copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members aren't copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. To learn more, go to [To add users to a user group](#add-users-to-a-user-group).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. To learn more, go to [To add users to a user group](#add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A validation error displays if you try to assign a user group that refers to a permission set which was defined in an extension that you uninstalled. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever something references it. To assign that user group to a user, either:
>
> - Reinstall the extension.
> - Remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set.
> - Remove that permission set from the user group.

## Assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

## Assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.
license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

## Convert users groups to security groups

> [!NOTE]
> Security groups replace user groups in 2024 release wave 2 (version 25) and later. If you're using on-premises version 22, 23, or 24, use the assisted setup guide to convert user groups to permission sets and transition to security groups.

Security groups are very similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Active Directory, depending on whether you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, respectively. Groups benefit administrators because they can use them with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.

### Convert user groups to permission sets

In 2023 release wave 1 and later, you can convert user groups to permission sets in your tenant. The permission sets provide the same functionality as user groups. Here are some examples:

* You can use the **Users** FactBox to manage permissions for users.
* You can drill down on the permission set name to add other permission sets to the set you're working on. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-add-other-permission-sets).

Use the **User Group Migration** assisted setup guide to convert your groups. To start the guide, on the **Feature Management** page, find **Feature: Convert user group permissions**, and then choose **All Users** in the **Enabled For** field. The assisted setup guide offers the following options for the conversion.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign to user     | Assign the permissions in user groups directly to the users who were assigned to the group, and remove their user group assignments.        |
|Convert to a permission set     | Create a new permission for the permissions in each user group. The new permission set is assigned to all members of each user group.          |

### License configurations still apply

You can configure permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on licenses. Those permissions are directly assigned to new users. These configurations still apply, even if you start using security groups.

To use security groups exclusively, we recommend that you remove the license configurations. To learn more about license configurations, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

You can remove license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. Learn more at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Review the purchase order lines, and in the **Vendor No.** field, select the vendor that supplies the goods.
5. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action to convert the lines to a purchase order.

## To view the linked purchase order from the sales order

Select the drop-shipment sales order line, choose the **Order** action, choose the **Drop Shipment** action, and then choose the **Purchase Order** action.

## To post a drop shipment

After the vendor ships the items, you can post the sales order as shipped. You can also post the purchase order, but only with the **Receive** option until the sales order has been invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales order.
3. In the **Qty. to Ship** field, specify how many of the order quantity to ship, the full or a partial order quantity.
4. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Send** action.
5. Choose either the **Ship** option to invoice later, or the **Ship and Invoice** option to invoice immediately.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to post the purchase order invoice.

# Bookmark a page or report on your role center

Using the bookmark icon, you can add an action that opens a page or report from the navigation menu of your role center. Bookmarks allow you to quickly reach your favorite content or business tasks. You add the bookmark from the target page or report, meaning the screen that you want the link on the role center to open.

The bookmark icon is shown in the top-right corner of a page and also in the **Tell Me** window where you can efficiently bookmark multiple pages or reports. If a bookmark already exists for the page, then the icon is dark, and the tooltip says "Bookmarked".

## Bookmark the target page

1. Open any page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark the target report

1. Open any report request page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark a page or report from the Tell Me window

1. Open the **Tell Me** window and enter, for example, **Sales Orders**.
2. Hover over the search result for the **Sales Orders** page or report, and then choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page or report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Frequently asked questions  

### Can I reorganize my bookmarks?

Yes. You can personalize your role center and move actions into a more optimal sequence or move them into existing groups or subgroups.  
Learn how to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### How do I remove a bookmark?

On the target page or report, choose the bookmark icon again to remove the involved action from your role center. You can also personalize your role center and temporarily hide actions without fully removing them.

### Where do I find my bookmarks?

When adding a bookmark to a page or report, the new action is added to the top navigation menu on your current home screen (role center). If you happen to have many actions, you may need to activate the **More** button to display all of them because the new action is always appended at the end of those actions.

### I don't have a bookmark icon. Is something wrong?

The ability to bookmark a page or report is one of many user personalization features in Business Central. If the bookmark icon isn't displayed, it's likely that your administrator has disabled personalization.

### Why can't I bookmark certain pages or reports?

Not all pages and reports can be bookmarked. When a page or report is run within some special context governed by the business application, the bookmark icon isn't displayed. For example, pages that cannot be found in the **Tell Me** window but are launched from elsewhere will not display a bookmark icon. Similarly, report request pages that are only used to collect filters without running the report will not display a bookmark icon.

  See technical details about [RunRequestPage](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/report/reportinstance-runrequestpage-method) and [FilterPageBuilder](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/filterpagebuilder/filterpagebuilder-data-type).

### When clearing my personalization, will my bookmarks also be cleared?

Yes. Bookmarks reside in the navigation menu. If you clear changes to the navigation menu from any page, or clear all personalization on the role center, all your new actions will be permanently removed.

### Why does the bookmark icon continue to indicate it's still not bookmarked?

When you add a bookmark, the new action is added to the navigation menu on the role center and subsequent visits to the page or report show a dark bookmark icon. If you personalize your role center and reorganize your actions by moving them into groups, the bookmark icon will no longer be dark and you can add another bookmark to that same page or report. This allows you to add multiple actions to the same page or report and categorize them into different groups.

### Why does my link to a report display a different report?

Some reports may be substituted by other reports after applying an extension to Business Central. When substitution occurs, the text of the new action isn't updated and will continue to display the name of the original report, but navigate to the newer report. To correct the text of the new action, you can remove the new action and add it again.
<!-- For more information on report substitution, see this link UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME -->

### Is bookmarking available for XMLports?

No. At this time, adding actions to open XMLports isn't possible from the user interface.

### Will my bookmarks be translated when I change my language in Business Central?

When you add a new action, any translated text that was available at the time is used when bookmarking. If new translated text is added later, then the new action will not include the newer translations.

### Why can't I add text in a page right after opening it with the bookmark?

When a page is bookmarked, the page will always open in the view mode from the bookmark&mdash;even if it was in the edit mode when it was bookmarked. Selecting the **Make changes on the page** icon ![Shows the pencil icon for editing the page.](media/edit-pencil.png) will let you add text in the fields that are editable.

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Design Details: Searching for Dimension Combinations
When you close a page after you edit a set of dimensions, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the edited set of dimensions exists. If the set does not exist, a new set is created and the dimension combination ID is returned.  

## Building Search Tree  
 Table 481 **Dimension Set Tree Node** is used when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a set of dimensions already exists in table 480 **Dimension Set Entry** table. The evaluation is performed by recursively traversing the search tree starting at the top level numbered 0. The top level 0 represents a dimension set with no dimension set entries. The children of this dimension set represent dimension sets with only one dimension set entry. The children of these dimension sets represent dimension sets with two children, and so on.  

### Example 1  
 The following diagram represents a search tree with six dimension sets. Only the distinguishing dimension set entry is displayed in the diagram.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree.png "Example of dimension tree structure")  

 The following table describes a complete list of dimension set entries that make up each dimension set.  

|Dimension Sets|Dimension Set Entries|  
|--------------------|---------------------------|  
|Set 0|None|  
|Set 1|AREA 30|  
|Set 2|AREA 30, DEPT ADM|  
|Set 3|AREA 30, DEPT PROD|  
|Set 4|AREA 30, DEPT ADM, PROJ VW|  
|Set 5|AREA 40|  
|Set 6|AREA 40, PROJ VW|  

### Example 2  
 This example shows how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a dimension set that consists of the dimension set entries AREA 40, DEPT PROD exists.  

 First, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **Dimension Set Tree Node** table to make sure that the search tree looks like the following diagram. Thus dimension set 7 becomes a child of the dimension set 5.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree_example2.png "Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013")  

### Finding Dimension Set ID  
 At a conceptual level, **Parent ID**, **Dimension**, and **Dimension Value**, in the search tree, are combined and used as the primary key because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] traverses the tree in the same order as the dimension entries. The GET function (record) is used to search for dimension set ID. The following code example shows how to find the dimension set ID when there are three dimension values.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet."Parent ID",UserDim.DimCode,UserDim.DimValueCode);  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```  

However, to preserve the ability of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to rename both a dimension and a dimension value, table 349, **Dimension Value**, is extended with an integer field, **Dimension Value ID**. This table converts the field pair, **Dimension** and **Dimension Value**, to an integer value. When you rename the dimension and dimension value, the integer value is not changed.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet.ParentID,UserDim."Dimension Value ID");  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```

# Sustainability scorecards and goals overview

This article offers guidance on how to create scorecards and goals, and how to update the status of goals. Scorecards and goals allow organizations to curate sustainability metrics and track them against key business objectives. Goals can be created based on current and target values, so users can keep track of the progress of current gas emissions, or water/waste intensity, compared to previous periods.  

## Create a scorecard  

To create a sustainability scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Scorecards** page, select **New** to create a new scorecard.  
3. Specify the **No.** and the **Name** fields on the **General** FastTab, and then add the **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Owner** field, you can only choose users who enabled the **Sustainability Manager** field on the **User Setup** page.

## Create goals  

To create a new sustainability goal, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Goals** action to create a new sustainability goal for the scorecard.  
3. Select **New** to start creating a goal.
4. The **Scorecard No.** is automatically added based on the value from the sustainability scorecard, and you can't edit this field. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also fills in the **Unit of Measure** field based on the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  
5. Fill in **No.** and **Name** of the new sustainability goal. The **Owner** field is automatically filled in based on the value from the connected **Sustainability Scorecard**.
6. You can create a sustainability goal for the entire company, a specific country/region, or a facility. To create a specific goal, choose the country or region in the **Country/Region Code** field or the facility in the **Responsibility Center** field.  
7. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields to set up a dedicated period for tracking current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Current Value for CO2**, **Current Value for CH4**, **Current Value for N2O**, **Current Value for Water Intensity**, and **Current Value for Waste Intensity** fields.  
8. Select the **Baseline Start Date** and **Baseline End Date** fields to set up a dedicated baseline period for comparing current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Baseline for CO2**, **Baseline for CH4**, **Baseline for N2O**, **Baseline for Water Intensity**, and **Baseline for Waste Intensity** fields.  
9. You can also add target values in the selected **Unit of Measure** field for the current period using the following **Target Value for CO2**, **Target Value for CH4**, **Target Value for N2O**, **Target Value for Water Intensity**, and **Target Value for Waste Intensity** fields.
10. You can specify one of these goals as a **Main Goal**. Values from the main goal are used on the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center.  

If you have many goals on the page, you can use the **Show My Goals** action to show only your goals. To show all, run the **Show All Goals** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sustainability goals for a specific sustainability scorecard. You can't create goals that aren't related to a scorecard, but you can create more goals for one scorecard. You can only have one sustainability goal as the **Main Goal**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up different combinations of goals for the whole company, specific countries or regions, and a responsibility center for a sustainability scorecard. You can also use different periods for the same model of tracking.

# Use time sheets

This article describes how to use time sheets to track absence, and to track time and resources that are spent on a project. Tracking time helps you identify issues early and avoid delays or cost overruns. Time sheets make it easy for a resource to report time usage for an individual or a machine so that managers can review the usage and its allocation.

You can copy and use your project planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct. To learn more, go to [To copy project planning lines to a time sheet](#copy-project-planning-lines-to-a-time-sheet).

After you approve time sheet entries for a project, you can post them to the relevant project journal or resource journal. To learn more, go to [To post time sheet lines in a project journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-project-journal) and [To post time sheet lines in a resource journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-resource-journal).

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. To learn more about setting up time sheets, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use time sheets on a mobile device. To do that, you might have to turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** toggle on the [Resources Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=462) page.

## Create time sheets

You can use the **Create Time Sheets** page to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. Then, the time sheet owner can open it and record time spent on a task. You can also [schedule the batch job to run automatically](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permissions to create time sheets. To learn more about permissions, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the **Create Time Sheets** action on the **Resources** list page and the **Resource Card** page.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Before you create time sheets for a resource, make sure that the **Use Time Sheet** and **Time Sheet Owner User ID** fields are specified for them on the **Resource Card** page.

    Optionally, choose the **Schedule** action to specify how often to automatically run the task. For example, to configure the task to run weekly for four weeks, on the **Schedule a Report - Create Time Sheets** page, in the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter **4W**. To learn more about how to schedule reports, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

You can view the time sheets that you create on the **Time Sheets** page. Each time sheet consists of one or more lines that define the time that you want to submit for approval. The following table describes the types of lines that you can add to the time sheet.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| | Use to add a note or marker in the **Description** field of the time sheet line. For example, you can use this field to categorize time sheet entries. If you leave the **Type** field empty for a time sheet line, you can't enter time values in the weekday fields for that line. |
| Absence | Use to register the time you're absent during a work week. To complete the information for the line, specify the type of absence in the **Cause of Absence Code** field. |
| Assembly Order | Used to register time for assembly orders. A time sheet line of this type is created while posting assembly order lines for which the resource is set up to use time sheets. You can't manually select a line of this type. |
| Project | Use to register time usage for a project. To complete the information for the line, specify the project number and the project task number for which you want to register time. You can register time for lines that aren't scheduled.|
| Resource | Use to register time usage for a resource. To complete the information for the line, provide a description of the work. |
| Service | Use to register time usage for a service order or service credit memo. |

For example, you want to submit a time sheet for a week where you did cleaning tasks and had a day off for a medical appointment. The following table shows how you would add lines to the time sheet.

| Type | Description | Work Type Code | Absence Type Code |
|--|--|--|--|
| Resource | Work hours | Cleaning |  |
| Absence | Time off |  | Health |
|  | I had to take off Tuesday due to a medical appointment. |  |  |

In this example, you can then register the hours across the relevant days for each workday.  

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, companies have predefined work types for the various types of lines. You just choose the relevant work type from the list, and then add a description.  
>
> Choose the work type by choosing:
>
> * The :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Description** field, or by selecting the field and pressing **F8**.
> * The **Activity Details** action and then specifying it in the page that opens.
> * The **Work Type Code** field or the **Absence Type Code** field, respectively. In this case, you can ignore the [To define work types and add one to a time sheet](#define-work-types-and-add-one-to-a-time-sheet) section.  

## Reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets

If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, copy the lines from the previous time period to save time. Then, just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.  
3. Use the following actions to specify what to copy:

   * To copy only the lines, choose the **Copy lines from time sheet** action.
   * To copy the lines and comments, choose **Copy lines from time sheet with comments** action.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a project, the **Project No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can modify the lines as needed.

## Copy project planning lines to a time sheet

The following procedure describes how to quickly add project planning lines to a time sheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Time Sheets** page, select a time sheet for the relevant time period.  
3. Choose the **Create lines from project planning** action. Any project planning lines in the time sheet time period are copied to the time sheet for the person or machine in the **Resource No.** field on the time sheet.

## Define work types and add one to a time sheet

You can define the work type for all-time sheet lines for service orders, project orders, and resources. In this way, you can add information that you need to bill the customer for different types of work.  

1. On the **Time Sheets** page, choose the relevant time sheet.
2. On the first of the lines in the **Lines** section, choose the **Type** field, and then choose the relevant type, such as *Resource*.  
3. Choose the **Description** field, and then, in the **Time Sheet Line Resource Detail** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
    1. If no work types exist, choose the **New** action.
    2. On the **Work Types** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then return to the time sheet.
4. Fill in the rest of the time sheet. Learn more in the [To fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval](#fill-in-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval) section.  

> [!TIP]
> You can follow similar steps to define absence codes.

## Fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval

Time sheet registration is tracked in hours, the standard base unit of measure for resources. By default, a time sheet shows the common work days of Monday through Friday.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a time sheet for the relevant period.
3. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary. Enter the number of hours used by the resource on each day of the week.  

    In most cases, to track work, you add a line of type **Resource**, and then register hours spent each day. If you want to register absence, add a line of type **Absence**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can review the sum of time sheet hours entered in the **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBox.  
4. Repeat step 3 for other work types that the resource performs.  

    Next, decide whether to submit all, or selected, lines on the time sheet.  

    * To submit the time sheet for one or more lines, choose the relevant line, and then choose the **Submit** action.

        On the submission page, choose the **Selected lines only** option. The state of the line changes from **Open** to **Submitted**.
    * To submit the time sheet for all open lines, choose the **Submit** action at the top of the **Time Sheet** page.  

        Confirm that you want to submit all open lines on the current time sheet.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only submit time sheet lines for which you entered time.  
5. To modify information on a line that is set to **Submitted**, select the line, and then choose the **Reopen** action.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A manager might reject a time sheet line that is submitted for approval. If a line has the status **Rejected**, you can make changes to the line, and then choose **Submit** again.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

## Approve or reject a time sheet

A time sheet must be submitted for approval before it can be used. You can approve and reject individual lines on a time sheet or send them back to the submitter. You approve a time sheet in two ways:

* A time sheet administrator can approve any time sheet.
* The person who is specified in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on a resource card can approve that resource's time sheets. To learn more about setting up approval, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a time sheet from the list.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page:
    1. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Approve** action.
    2. Choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Reject** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Time Sheet Status** and **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBoxes to get an overview of time sheet information.

After you approve or reject a time sheet, if you want to update it you must reopen it. The following procedure explains how to reopen an approved or rejected time sheet.

## Reopen a time sheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets** or **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a time sheet from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only reopen lines with the status **Approved**. You can't reopen lines with the status **Rejected** or that are posted.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page, choose the **Reopen** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to reopen all lines, or the **Selected lines only** action to reopen only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The status of the time sheets line or lines is changes to **Submitted**.  

## View and approve time sheets by project

On a project, you can specify a person who is responsible for the project. That information is linked to time sheet lines. The link gives project managers a list of the time sheets to approve. For example, the team's project manager might be responsible for certain projects in your company. In that case, the manager should be designated as the **Person Responsible** on the Project Card page. This view of time sheet information shows the project tasks associated with a project and the quantity of hours used.

> [!NOTE]
> To approve time sheets on the **Manager Time Sheet by Project** page, you must first select a **Time Sheet by Project Approval** option in the **Resources Setup** page. To learn how to set up approvals for resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).

# Period-Over-Period Growth (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period Growth** report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. The report compares sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, providing insight into growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the sales amount in September 2023 to the sales amount in September 2022. If the analysis scope is fiscal years, the report compares the sales amount in fiscal year 2023 to the sale amount in fiscal year 2022.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-growth.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Period-Over-Period Growth Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-growth.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Previous Period**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pp-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop--fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data 

Copilot in Business Central uses AI from the Azure OpenAI Service, hosted and operated by Microsoft and built with enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance controls. This article explains the data that the service processes when you use Copilot.

## How Business Central communicates with Azure OpenAI Service

Each time you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any data needed for Copilot to perform the task, are sent to the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint.

- Each request to Copilot, such as a chat message or a request to match records, is converted to one or more service calls to the endpoint.
- Prompts, results, and data from any one call are never shared or accessible to other calls by other users of the service. Including business data with prompts improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from the Business Central database. Business Central selects this data and retrieves it using Business Central's standard mechanisms for data access, ensuring that Copilot can only access the same data as the user operating Copilot. Copilot has no way to circumvent Business Central’s security, privacy, and compliance controls.  
- User input and business data might include personal information, depending on the task.
- Prompt and output data might be stored for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but Microsoft only reviews the data if the automated systems flag it for review.
- Microsoft doesn't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models.

> [!NOTE]
> When administrators activate a Copilot feature or enable data movement to Azure OpenAI Service, the entire company database remains in its location:
>
> - It isn't transferred to the Azure OpenAI Service.
> - It isn't moved to another geographic region.
> - AI isn't trained on that data.  

## Example Copilot features and their data flow

For a high-level understanding of the data sent to Azure OpenAI Service, the following table provides three examples of how Business Central sends prompts and data to the service.

The table isn't an exhaustive list of features and doesn't provide a complete and accurate picture of every data point sent to the service.

|Copilot feature|Example of user interaction|Example of data sent to Azure OpenAI Service|
|-|-|-|
|Chat|User asks Copilot to "show customer Adatum" |<ul><li>System instructions to interpret and act on the user's message, including system-defined constraints and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of most likely table and page names, the list of available field names for those objects, along with descriptive information such as teaching tips and tooltips.</li></ul>| 
|Analysis assist|While viewing the Items list, the user asks Copilot to display "items by category" |<ul><li>System instructions to generate an analysis tab, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of column captions from the Items list, along with tooltips and similar descriptive information.</li><li>If the list includes option fields with predefined values, the possible values are included.</li></ul>|
|Bank account reconciliation assist|User activates the **Reconcile** Copilot action on the details page |<ul><li>System instructions to compare records, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of bank statement lines (transaction descriptions, dates, and amounts) that the user requested Copilot to process. Additionally, the minimal list of bank account ledger entry records or G/L account names they're compared with.</li></ul>|

# User Access Flow for Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes what happens when a user accesses Business Central data using their Microsoft 365 license for the first time. Understanding this flow allows administrators to plan their approach and configure Business Central to match their business needs.

1. First, the user’s identity is authenticated 
2. Business Central verifies that all the [minimum requirements](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#minimum-requirements) are met.
3. Business Central verifies that this user does not have a greater license, such as a Business Central license or an administrative role such as a delegated admin role. 
4. Business Central verifies whether the user is accessing data that belongs to an environment that has enabled access with Microsoft 365 licenses. 
5. The user record is provisioned in Business Central, assigning the User Group, Profile and Permission Sets defined in the Microsoft 365 license configuration page. By default, the Teams Users user group is assigned, the Employee profile is assigned, and only the Login permission set is assigned. Any other defaulting of user settings is also applied, just like a licensed Business Central user. 
6. The full Business Central security model is applied, to determine whether the user should be able to access the record, page, in the specified company and specified environment. 

If all steps succeed, the user can now view this Business Central data in Teams. The Business Central service automatically ensures read-only access and simplifies the UI. 

The user account is now registered in Business Central and can be managed like any Business Central user.

> [!NOTE]
> Steps may vary depending on any additional security configuration that you have specified in Microsoft 365 or Business Central.

# Collect outstanding balances

This article describes features that can help you collect outstanding balances from your customers.

When customer payments are registered and reconciled, the collections process often involves one or more of the following steps to collect outstanding balances. Depending on the way you handle collections in your business, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you:

- Send statements to inform customers about their balances, overdue balances, and the relevant transactions. For example, either open entries or all entries posted in last year/quarter/month or other period. If customers have overdue payments, you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder. To learn more, go to [Statements](#statements).
- Send reminders (also known as *dunning letters* or *payment requests*) to customers to inform them of overdue balances. The reminder can include both overdue and open entries, so the customer is also aware of upcoming due dates. You can also use reminders to calculate finance charges, such as interest or fees and include them on the reminder. You can automate the processes for creating, issuing, and posting reminders. To learn more, go to [Reminders](#reminders).  
- Send finance charge memos to claim interest fees for overdue amounts. Use finance charge memos if you want to debit customers for interest or fees without reminding them of overdue amounts. To learn more, go to [Finance Charges](#finance-charges).
- Communicate with customers over the phone or by e-mail regarding overdue balances and manage potential misunderstandings and disputes, or simply to remind customers to balance their accounts in a more direct manner. To learn more, go to [Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work](#use-copilot-for-finance-in-outlook-to-streamline-manual-collections-work).

## Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot for Finance is currently in preview and available in the United States. It's planned to become generally available in the second half of 2024, at which point pricing information is expected to be published.

When you're communicating with customers via e-mail about outstanding balances, chances are you need to look up customer and invoice related information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot for Finance makes this task easier by ensuring that relevant customer data is on hand in Outlook. For example, for an email you received, Copilot for Finance can find the customer through the linked contact and display aged balance information and list outstanding invoices that you can easily attach to a reply. Copilot for Finance in Outlook also lets you:

- Access and update the **Dispute Status** and **Promise to Pay** date on invoices
- Update contact information
- Draft e-mail replies with Copilot
- Attach a statement and invoices directly from Outlook.

To learn more, go to [Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-for-finance) and [Deployment Guide for Copilot for Finance (preview)](/copilot/finance/get-started/deployment-guide).

## Statements

From the customer card, you can create a statement for customer's transactions with you. Then, you can generate a PDF file and send it to the customer. Alternatively, use the **Customer Statement** report to send your customers an overview of their business with you.

> [!TIP]
> If needed, you can send the statement to Excel to make changes.  

### To send the Customer Statement report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Statement**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Under **Output Options**, select how to send the report to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using multiple currencies, the Customer Statement report is always printed in the customer's currency. The last date in a statement period is also used as the statement date and the aging date, if aging is included.

## Reminders

[!INCLUDE [receivables-reminders](includes/receivables-reminders.md)]

## Finance charges

When a customer doesn't pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments. Alternatively, you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders.  

Before you can create finance charge memos, you must set up terms. For more information, see [Set Up Finance Charge Terms](finance-setup-finance-charges.md).  

You can manually create a finance charge memo for an individual customer, and fill in the lines automatically. Alternatively, you can use the **Create Finance Charge Memos** action to create finance charge memos for all or selected customers with overdue balances.  

After you create the finance charge memos, you can modify them. The text that appears at the beginning and end of the finance charge memo is determined by the finance charge terms, and can be seen in the **Description** column on the lines. If a calculated amount is added automatically in the beginning or ending text, the text won't be adjusted if you delete lines. Then you must use the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.  

After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos, typically as email.

### To create a finance charge memo manually

A finance charge memo is similar to an invoice. You can fill in a header manually and have the lines filled in for you, or you can create finance charge memos for all customers automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose **Suggest Fin. Charge Memo Lines** action.
4. On the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** page, set a filter on the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create finance charge memos only for specific entries.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although they're listed, selecting **Payment** and **Credit Memo** as **Document Type** filters won't have an effect because the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** action only handles positive amounts.
5. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.  

### To update finance charge memo texts

In some cases, you might want to modify the beginning and ending text for the finance charge terms. If you do this at a time when you have created, but not yet issued, finance charge memos, you can update the memos with the modified text.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memo**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the finance charge memo that you want to change text for, and then choose the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.
3. On the **Update Finance Charge Text** page, you can set a filter if you want to update several memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button to update the beginning and ending texts.  

### To issue finance charge memos

After you create finance charge memos and make any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos.

When you issue a reminder, the entries post according to your specifications on the **Finance Charge Terms** page. This specification determines whether interest and/or additional fees post to the customer's account and the general ledger. Settings on the **Customer Posting Groups** page determine the accounts that interest or fees post to.

For each customer ledger entry on the finance charge memo, an entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page.

If the **Post Interest** or the **Post Additional Fee** checkboxes are selected on the **Finance Charge Terms** page, the following entries are also created:

- One entry on the **Cust. Ledger Entries** page
- One receivables entry in the relevant G/L account
- One interest and/or one additional fee entry in the relevant G/L account

Also, issuing the finance charge memo might result in VAT entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant memo, and then choose the **Issue** action.
3. On the **Issue Finance Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The finance charge memo is either printed for sent to a specified email as a PDF attachment.

### To cancel an issued finance charge memo

If finance charge memos were issued in error, you can cancel them before they're sent out. You can do this either one by one or as a batch.

1. On the **Issued Finance Charge Memos** page, select one or more lines for issued finance charge memos that you want to cancel, and then choose the **Cancel** action.
2. On the **Cancel Issued Fin. Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

### To view reminder and finance charge entries  

When you issue a reminder, a reminder entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page for each reminder line that contains a customer ledger entry. You can then get an overview of the created reminder entries for a specific customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant customer card, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the line with the ledger entry you want to see the reminder entries for, and then choose the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** action.

# Check amounts on purchase invoices and credit memos

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

Before posting a purchase invoice or credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the amount including VAT and the VAT amount on the document equals the total amount on the purchase lines. This check requires that you fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoice or credit memo.  

When the document has only one purchase line, or all lines are subject to the same VAT percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field when you add purchase lines and fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** field. If there are several lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually enter the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field.  

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the total amounts. If you prefer that it doesn't, you can turn off the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you turn on this feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos which, depending on the number of documents, might take some time.
>
> You can't turn on this feature if you have purchase invoices or credit memos that don't have lines, or where a quantity isn't specified on the lines.

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

# Fixed assets analytics

Businesses with fixed assets capture a lot of data about them during daily activities. That data supports valuable business intelligence (BI) for fixed assets managers:

- Asset acquisitions
- Asset deprecation
- Insurance and maintenance
- Asset budgets

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share data about your organization's fixed assets:

- Financial reporting (for financial statements and KPIs on fixed assets accounts)
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in fixed assets analytics tools
- Built-in fixed assets reports

> [!NOTE]
> Analytics for fixed assets is a little different than other areas. You need to analyze data that's already present, such as asset acquisitions, deprecation, and insurance, but also data about future (projected) data, such as depreciation and asset retirements. For the latter type of analysis, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in reports that can calculate these numbers.

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article describes ways use these analytical features to get insights into your fixed assets.

## Analytics needs in asset management

When thinking of analytics needs in asset management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes their analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

When it comes to data, people in different roles have different needs, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CFO / COO / CEO                 | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Asset Management / Controller   | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Bookkeeper                      | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

## Asset Management KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In asset management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's use of assets:

- Total Asset Turnover
- Return on Assets

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to fixed assets

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for asset management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track fixed assets postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reporting, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to fixed assets)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for asset management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your fixed assets accounts to be able to track fixed assets KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries** or **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-overview-current-value.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see asset value." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-overview-current-value.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page for ledger entries, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png"::: -->

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

For more information on how to do ad-hoc analysis on Fixed Assets ledgers, see [Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data](ad-hoc-analysis-fa.md).


## Built-in reports for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who report on fixed assets.

[!INCLUDE [fa_reports_report_explorer](includes/fa-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

For more information about reports that are relevant for fixed assets, see [Built-in fixed assets reports](fa-reports.md).

## On-screen fixed assets analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you fixed assets overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Calculate depreciation, post depreciation, and analyze depreciation](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md)
- [Monitor maintenance costs](fa-how-maintain.md#monitor-maintenance-costs)
- [Monitor insurance coverage](fa-how-insure.md#to-monitor-insurance-coverage)
- [View changed depreciation book values](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md#to-view-changed-depreciation-book-values-due-to-fixed-asset-reclassification)
- [View disposal ledger entries](fa-how-dispose-retire.md#to-view-disposal-ledger-entries)
- [View projected disposal values](fa-how-manage-budgets.md#to-view-projected-disposal-values)

### Show fixed asset general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers in the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for fixed assets, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows asset accounts, or maybe only the asset accounts you use for posting fixed assets entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page-fa.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page-fa.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to fixed assets)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as FA journals. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the department or location an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md)

# Average Production Times (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Average Production Times** report shows the detailed average production times for each item. The report can help you make informed decisions and optimize your production processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Average Production Times Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the average time it takes to produce each item. For example, you might want to identify the items that take the longest to produce and schedule their production process.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the production time for a particular item and the quantity produced on production orders. For example, you notice that the production time for a particular item is longer than expected. You can use the report to identify the cause of the delay and optimize the production process to increase efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Average Production Times* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Average Production Time Per Finished Quantity](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#average-production-time-per-finished-quantity)
- [Actual Time Used](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-time-used)
- [Finished Quantity](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#finished-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Production Order
- Capacity Ledger Entry

# Transfer bank funds

You might sometimes need to transfer an amount from one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to another. To do this, you must post the transaction on the **General Journals** page. The task varies depending on whether the bank accounts use the same currency or different currencies.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with the same currency code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On a journal line, fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. In the **Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be transferred.

    Next, you must specify the balancing account. If you can't see the relevant fields, then choose the **Show More Columns** action to view all available fields.
6. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. Post the journal.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with different currency codes

To transfer funds between bank accounts that use different currencies, you must post two general journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create two journal lines, and fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. On the first journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some companies prefer to transfer between accounts on separate journal lines. Other companies prefer to post everything on one journal line by using a balancing account. Check with your local expert if you're not sure what to do.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a balancing account, then set the **Bal. Account Type** field to **Bank Account**, and set the **Bal. Account No.** field to the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds. Then proceed to step 9 or 10.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a separate journal line, then move on to the next step.
6. On the second journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
9. If the exchange rates used in the journal are different than the exchange rates on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, enter a new journal line for the exchange rate gain or loss.  

    1. Enter **G/L Account** in the **Account Type** field.  

    2. Enter the G/L account number for exchange rate gain or loss in the **Account No.** field.  

    3. Enter the exchange rate gain or loss in the **Amount** field with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
10. Post the journal.

# Set up locations

Locations are places such as warehouses where you buy, store, or sell items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses locations to help keep track of inventory in both simple and complex warehouse processes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. To learn more, go to [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fe5ed50e-2e5d-47d4-8616-92ae4639f400]

## Location cards

You specify information about a location, such as a warehouse or distribution center, on the **Location Card** page. You give each location a name and a code that represents the location. You can then enter the location code in other parts of the program when you want to record transactions for a given location.  

You can enter information about bins and warehouse policies for each location. Based on your warehouse policies, you can use the options on the **Bins** FastTab to specify the bins to use by default for transactions. If you're using directed put-away and pick, the options on the **Bin Policies** FastTab let you define how to use advanced warehousing features.  

Some option fields depend on settings in the **Location Card** page to restrict unsupported setup combinations.  

Choose the **Zones** or **Bins** actions to view information about zones and bins that are defined for the location.

### To set up a location

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many fields on the Location Card page are related to the handling of items in inbound and outbound warehouse processes. These fields are not relevant for companies that do not require complex warehouse functionality. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

You can change the configuration of a location as long as it doesn't have item ledger entries.  

If you have multiple locations, you can define transfer routes between locations. To learn more about transfer routes, go to [To create a transfer route](inventory-how-setup-locations.md#to-create-a-transfer-route).

### To create a transfer route

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
4. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. To learn more about transfers, go to [Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

## Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure and can suggest where to put items. Your bins can have contents, or be floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, on the **Location Card** page, on the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle. You can design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in the fields for the warehouse processes on the **Bins** and **Bin Policies** FastTabs.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can specify bin codes on a location, you must create bin codes. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## Zones

If you want to structure your bins under zones, you can do that in the **Zones** page. When you assign a zone to bins, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies information from the zone to the bins. You can also choose to set up one zone and use bins alone to organize your warehouse. To learn more about zones, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Default Dimensions for Locations

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them using various reporting tools. For example, dimensions can indicate the department or project an entry came from. Having default dimensions helps people avoid making mistakes and having to enter dimensions manually on the transaction level if all goods come from a single location and department.

You set default dimensions for a location on the **Location Card** page by choosing **Dimensions**. Afterward, the location's default dimensions are assigned to the following documents when you choose the location on a line.

* Transfer orders
* Physical inventory orders
* Inventory shipments
* Inventory receipts
* Item journals

If needed, you can delete or change the dimension on the line. In the **Value Posting** field, you can require people to specify dimensions for locations before they can post an entry. If you want to allow people to choose only certain dimension values, you can specify the values in the **Allowed Values Filter** field. You can also include location dimension values on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, and for combinations of priority and dimension rules on the **Dimension Combinations** page.

Because transfer order documents and reclassification journals deal with more than one location, the order in which you enter data is important. Default dimensions are copied from the last location field (the in-transit location is ignored).

### Example of default dimensions on locations

The following examples illustrate how the default dimension is used.

You have the following dimension settings:

* Location EAST. Department dimension is ADM
* Location WEST. Department dimension is PROD

You specify the location on a transfer order as follows:

1. From Location = EAST
2. To Location = WEST

The PROD dimension will be copied from location WEST.

You fill in the fields in the opposite order, as follows:

1. To Location = WEST
2. From Location = EAST

The ADM dimension will be copied from location EAST.

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Capacity Variance (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Capacity Variance** report gives an overview of the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis. This report helps you identify areas where costs are overrunning. You can optimize production processes, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Capacity Variance Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track and manage capacity costs for production operations. By analyzing the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis, you can find areas where costs are overrunning and take corrective action.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the performance of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual capacity costs against the expected costs, you can quickly uncover deviations. For example, the report might show that the cost of raw materials increased significantly. You can investigate whether the issue is due to supplier pricing or production inefficiencies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Capacity Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Actual Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-capacity-cost)
- [Expected Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost)
- [Standard Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-variance)
- [Standard Capacity Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost-variance)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-dev-percent)
- [Standard Capacity Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost-dev-percent)
- [Prod Order Actual Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-actual-capacity-need)
- [Prod Order Expected Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-expected-capacity-need)

# Record and reimburse employees' expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employees in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization might have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is flexible enough to suit many different practices. The exact account numbers to use depend on your organization's configuration and processes.  

You can use general journals for employee accounts to register employee expenses and reimbursement transactions in foreign currencies, and then easily track the amounts and compare them to receipts. Leave your calculator in your desk drawer—Business Central can adjust the exchange rate for you. When you use general journals to post transactions for employee accounts, such as when you reimburse expenses, you can use the **Currency Code** field to specify the currency for the transactions. Specifying a currency lets you use the same features as when you register transactions in the customer and vendor ledgers. For example, employees can register an expense in euros but get paid in dollars.

To ensure that the exchange rate for the amounts is up to date, you can adjust employee balances when you run the currency exchange rate batch job. If you want to use the exchange rate table, but settle employee balances in your local currency, you can exclude employee accounts when you adjust exchange rates.

## To record an employee's expense

You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee

You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries

You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Purchasing

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. If you need to control an inventory, purchase invoices are also used to dynamically update inventory levels so that you can minimize your inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices contribute to profit figures and other financial KPIs on your Role Center.

You must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity wasn't available at the vendor. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use purchase orders. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same way as purchase invoices.

You can have purchase invoices created automatically by using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service to convert PDF invoices from your vendors to electronic documents, which are then converted to purchase invoices by a workflow. To use this functionality, you must first sign up for the OCR service, and then perform various setups. To learn more, go to [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

Products can be both inventory items and services. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

For all purchase processes, you can use an approval workflow, for example, to require that an accounting manager approves large purchases. To learn more, go to [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Advanced Warehouse Configurations

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], receiving and putting away occurs using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method D in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In advanced warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require receiving processing in addition to put-away processing, you use the **Warehouse Receipt** page to record and post the receipt of items on multiple inbound orders. When the warehouse receipt is posted, one or more warehouse put-away documents are created to instruct warehouse workers to take the received items and place them in designated places according to bin setup or in other bins. The specific placement of the items is recorded when the warehouse put-away is registered. The inbound source document can be a purchase order, sales return order, inbound transfer order, or assembly or production order with output that is ready to be put away. If the receipt is created from an inbound order, more than one inbound source document can be retrieved for the receipt. By using this method you can register many items arriving from different inbound orders with one receipt.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

-   Setting up WHITE location for receiving and putting away.  
-   Creating and releasing two purchase orders for full warehouse handling.  
-   Creating and posting a warehouse receipt document for multiple purchase order lines from specific vendors.  
-   Registering a warehouse put-away for the received items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Warehouse Manager  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Receiving Staff  
-   Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

-   CRONUS installed.  
-   To make yourself a warehouse employee at WHITE location by following these steps:  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Users** page.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select the **Default** field.  

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, creates two purchase orders for accessory items from vendors 10000 and 20000 to be delivered to WHITE warehouse. When the deliveries arrive at the warehouse, Sammy, who is responsible for receiving items from vendors 10000 and 20000, uses a filter to create receipt lines for purchase orders arriving from the two vendors. Sammy posts the items as received into inventory in one warehouse receipt and makes the items available for sale or other demand. John, the warehouse worker, takes the items from the receiving bin and puts them away. John puts all units away in their default bins, except 40 out of 100 received hinges are put away in the assembly department by splitting the put-away line. When John registers the put-away, the bin contents are updated and the items are made available for picking from the warehouse.  

## Reviewing the WHITE Location Setup

The setup of the **Location Card** page defines the company's warehouse flows.  

### To review the location setup  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the WHITE location card.  
3.  Note on the **Warehouse** FastTab that the **Directed Put-away and Pick** check box is selected.  

    This means that the location is set up for the highest complexity level, reflected by the fact that all warehouse handling check boxes on the FastTab are selected.  

4.  Note on the **Bins** FastTab that bins are specified in the **Receipt Bin Code** and the **Shipment Bin Code** fields.  

This means that when you create a warehouse receipt, this bin code is copied to the header of the warehouse receipt document by default and to the lines of the resulting warehouse put-aways.  

## Creating the Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase orders  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70200|WHITE|100 PCS|  
    |70201|WHITE|50 PCS|  

    Proceed to notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4.  Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    Proceed to create the second purchase order.  

5.  Choose the **New** action.  
6.  Create a purchase order for vendor 20000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70100|WHITE|10 CAN|  
    |70101|WHITE|12 CAN|  

    Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    The deliveries of items from vendors 10000 and 20000 have arrived at WHITE warehouse, and Sammy starts to process the purchase receipts.  

## Receiving the Items

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, you can manage multiple inbound orders for source documents, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive the items  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select **Actions** then **Functions** then choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.  
5.  In the **Code** field, enter **ACCESSORY**.  
6.  In the **Description** field, enter **Vendors 10000 and 20000**.  
7.  Choose the **Modify** action.  
8.  On the **Purchase** FastTab, in the **Buy-from Vendor No. Filter** field, enter **10000&#124;20000**.  
9. Choose the **Run** action. The warehouse receipt is filled with four lines representing purchase order lines for the specified vendors. The **Qty. to Receive** field is filled because you did not select the **Do not Fill Qty. to Handle** check box on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page.  
10. Optionally, if you want to use a filter as described earlier in this section, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select purchase orders from the vendors in question.  
11. Choose **Posting** then the **Post Receipt** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Positive item ledger entries are created reflecting the posted purchase receipts of accessories from vendors 10000 and 20000, and the items are ready to be put away in the warehouse from the receiving bin.  

## Putting the Items Away

On the **Warehouse Put-away** page, you can manage put-aways for a specific warehouse receipt document covering multiple source documents. Like all warehouse activity documents, each item on the warehouse put-away is represented by a Take line and a Place line. In the following procedure, the bin code on the Take lines is the default receiving bin at WHITE location, W-08-0001.  


### To put the items away  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-Aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the only warehouse put-away document in the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    The warehouse put-away document opens with a total of eight Take or Place lines for the four purchase order lines.

    The warehouse worker is told that 40 hinges are needed in the assembly department, and proceeds to split the single Place line to specify a second Place line for bin W-02-0001 in the assembly department where the warehouse worker places that part of the received hinges.  

3.  Select the second line on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, the Place line for item 70200.  
4.  In the **Qty. to Handle** field, change the value from 100 to 60.  
5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Split Line**. A new line is inserted for item 70200 with 40 in **Qty. to Handle** field.  
6.  In the **Bin Code** field, enter W-02-0001. The **Zone Code** field is automatically filled.  

    By default, the **Zone Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

    Proceed to register the put-away.  

7.  Choose the **Register Put-Away** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    The received accessories are now put-away in the items' default bins, and 40 hinges are placed in the assembly department. The received items are now available for picking to internal demand, such as assembly orders, or to external demand, such as sales shipments.

# Inspecting pages in Business Central

The page inspection feature enables you to get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection is especially designed for administrators, power users, support personnel, and developers. It's ideal for learning the data model behind a page and troubleshooting. For example, if you're experiencing a problem with a page, you can use page inspection to get information to pass on to your system administrator or support personnel.

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, through page inspection, you can start Visual Studio Code from within the web client to further investigate and debug source code of an extension. For more information, see [Troubleshoot in Visual Studio Code directly from the web client](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-troubleshoot-vscode-webclient) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)]

## Work with page inspection

You start page inspection from the **Help & Support** page. Choose the question mark in the top right corner, choose **Help & Support**, and then choose **Inspect pages and data**. Or, you can just use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>.

The **Page inspection** pane opens on the side. When the pane first opens, it shows information that pertains to the main page object.

Use the keyboard or pointing device to move focus to different elements on the page. When you select a FactBox or a part on the main page, the bounding area is highlighted by a border, and the **Page Inspection** pane shows information about the selected element. For example, the previous figure shows information about the list part in the **Sales Order** page. As you navigate to other pages in the application, the **Page Inspection** pane will automatically update with page information as you move along.

For more information about what is shown in page inspection, see [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

If you don't see the details that you expect to see in the **Page Inspection** pane, you probably don't have the required permissions, as described in the next section.

## Controlling access to page inspection details

As an administrator, you can control access to the full details that are shown in the **Page Inspection** pane by configuring the permissions that users have. To grant a user permission to the full details, give users **Execute** permission on the **System** object **5330**. You can grant this permission by using a permission set (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**) or a user group (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**). For more information about permissions, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

Users who aren't granted permissions on **System object 5330** can still access the **Page Inspection** pane, but they will only see the **Page** and **Table** fields, which display basic details that they can pass on to their support team.

# Introduction to Business Central and Power BI

It's easy to get insights into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data with [[!INCLUDE[powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) - a data visualization system from Microsoft. [!INCLUDE[powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] retrieves [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data so that you can build dashboards and reports based on that data. [!INCLUDE[powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] provides a flexible alternative to reports built in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], enabling you drill down and customize the visualization, and even merge data from different companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Some [!INCLUDE[powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can also be embedded in Business Central and viewed without leaving the system. More complex dashboards are better experienced from the [!INCLUDE[powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] web site.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Delete cost budget entries

You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you can't delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

## To delete a cost budget entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and can't be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2. Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Design

Item tracking in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] started with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The item tracking functionality is in a separate object structure with intricate links to posted documents and item ledger entries, and it is integrated with the reservation system, which handles reservation, order tracking, and action messaging. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md) in the Supply Planning design details.  

This design incorporates item tracking entries in total availability calculations throughout the system, including planning, manufacturing, and warehousing. Serial and lot numbers are applied on the item ledger entries to ensure simple access to historical data for item tracking purposes. With 2021 release wave 1, item tracking in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes package numbers.  

With the addition of serial, lot, and package numbers, the reservation system handles permanent item attributes while also handling intermittent links between supply and demand in the form of order tracking entries and reservation entries. Another different characteristic of serial or lot numbers compared to the conventional reservation data is the fact that they can be posted, either partially or fully. Therefore, the **Reservation Entry** table (T337) now works with a related table, the **Tracking Specification** table (T336), which manages and displays summing across active and posted item tracking quantities. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  

The following diagram outlines the design of item tracking functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

![Example of item tracking flow.](media/design_details_item_tracking_design.png "Example of item tracking flow")  

The central posting object is redesigned to handle the unique subclassification of a document line in the form of serial or lot numbers, and special relation tables are added to create the one-to-many relations between posted documents and their split item ledger entries and value ledger entries.  

Codeunit 22, **Item Jnl. – Post Line**, now splits the posting according to the item tracking numbers that are specified on the document line. Each unique item tracking number on the line creates its own item ledger entry for the item. This means that the link from the posted document line to the associated item ledger entries is now a one-to-many relation. This relation is handled by the following item tracking relation tables.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Item Entry Relation** (T6507)|Relates shipped or received lines to item ledger entries|  
|**Value Entry Relation** (T6508)|Relates invoiced lines to value entries|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure](design-details-item-tracking-posting-structure.md).

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. You can also set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, and text that makes the email more friendly. For example, a standard greeting. To learn more, go to [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. To learn more, go to [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You can't also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how to attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, the **Send Email** page opens. The page shows the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you don't want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page won't open. See Step 4. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar, or want to send a bulk communication, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. For example, to advertise a sales campaign. You can create a template for entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts. Templates can generate the content of an email message for you. Templates can even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. The attachment is added because a default attachment is assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. To learn more, go to [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add the default attachment from the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they're sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document was printed. The number in that field is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email.

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. It stores the emails to let you resend them, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can access a list of messages that people sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** contains the emails that you saved as drafts and emails that failed to send. For example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Sustainability certificates

In today’s business landscape, sustainability is more than a trend - it’s a necessity. As companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and meet growing consumer demand for responsible practices, sustainability certificates are now an essential tool for validating these efforts. These certificates serve as an independent verification that a company or its products meet specific environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, fostering trust and transparency in the marketplace.  

Sustainability certificates offer a clear and measurable way to assess the environmental and ethical credentials of both companies and their products. By prioritizing vendors who hold recognized sustainability certifications, businesses can enhance their supply chain integrity, reduce risks, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Sustainability certificates for companies cover a wide range of criteria, including resource efficiency, waste management, emissions reduction, and social responsibility. Similarly for products, these certifications ensure that items meet stringent environmental standards, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal. 

## Sustainability certificate area 

The *sustainability certificate area* refers to the specific area covered by a particular certificate. Generally, this method is used to categorize similar certificates based on distinct characteristics. To create new sustainability certificate area, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Areas**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Areas** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate area. 
3. Close the page.   

## Sustainability certificate standards

The *Sustainability certificate standard* refers to the specific standard for a particular certificate. Generally, it should provide third-party verified, transparent, and measurable criteria aligned with international ESG frameworks to promote responsible business practices. To create new sustainability certificate standard, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Standards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Standards** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate standard. 
3. Close the page.  

## Create a sustainability certificate 

To create a new sustainability certificate, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Certificates**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Certificates** page, select **New**.
3. In the **Type** field, choose if this certificate is related to vendors or items, and enter the **No.** and **Name** fields.
4. In the **Area** field, choose specific **Sust. Certificate Area** option and in the **Standard** field, choose adequate **Sust. Certificate Standard**.
5. In the **Issuer** field, specify the issuer name. 
Sustainability certificates are typically issued by independent third-party organizations, which can include non-profit certifying bodies, industry associations, standards organizations, or specialized sustainability certification firms. The issuers are responsible for assessing compliance with established sustainability standards.
1. If this certificate has a measurable value, enable the **Has Value** field and enter the **Value**.   

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create a new sustainabilty directly from the vendor or item card. In this case, the **Type** field is automatically prepopulated as an Item or Vendor based on where you create the certificate.   
 
### Add the sustainability certificate for vendors

# Work with general journals

Most financial transactions are posted to the general ledger through documents such as purchase invoices and sales orders. However by posting journal lines, you can also process business activities such as:

* Purchasing
* Payments
* Using recurring journals to post accruals
* Refunding employee expenses

Most journals are based on the general journal, and you can process all transactions on the **General Journals** page. Learn more at [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

For example, you can use post employee expenses for reimbursement. Learn more at [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers journals that are optimized for specific types of transactions, such as the *Payment Journal* for registering payments. Learn more at [Record Payments and Refunds in the Payment Journal](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).  

You use general journals to post financial transactions to general ledger accounts and various other accounts. The other accounts include bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account. The entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in the journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to entries on individual accounts, where it can't be changed. You can, however, unapply posted entries, and you can post reversing or correcting entries. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]  

## Add context to general journal transactions

When you create a journal, you can add links that give context to its transactions. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the links to the posted journal and ledger entries the journal creates. For example, providing links can make life easier for your auditor. If you keep images of your expense receipts on your company's Sharepoint site, you can add links to the files. When you post the journal to submit your expenses, your auditor can quickly get to the receipt files.

## Use journal templates and batches

There are several general journal templates. Each journal template is represented by a dedicated page with particular functions and the fields that are required to support those functions, such as the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page to process bank payments and the **Payment Journals** page to pay your vendors or reimburse your employees. Learn more at [Make Payments](payables-make-payments.md) and [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md).

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. For example, you can define your own journal batch for the payment journal that has your personal layout and settings. The following tip is an example of how to personalize a journal.

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page, then the **Amount** field on, for example, general journal lines for the same document number is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the document. Learn more at [Letting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can add or remove fields in journals by personalizing them. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### Validating general journal batches

You can turn on a background check that helps prevent delays when posting. The check notifies you when a mistake in the financial journal you're working on will prevent you from posting the journal. On the **General Journal Batches** page, you can choose **Background Error Check** to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate finance journals, such as general or payment journals, while you're working on them.

When you enable the validation, the **Check Document** or **Journal Check** FactBoxes show issues in the current line and the whole batch. Validation happens when you load a finance journal batch, and when you choose another journal line. The **Issues total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found, and you can choose it to open an overview of the issues.

You can use the **Show Lines with Issues** and **Show All Lines** actions to toggle between journal lines that do or don't have issues. The **Journal Line Details** FactBox provides quick overview and access to data from journal lines, such as the G/L account, customer, or vendor, and the posting setup for specific accounts.

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]  

## Understanding main accounts and balancing accounts

If you set up default balancing accounts for the journal batches on the **General Journals** page, the balancing account is filled in automatically when you fill in the **Account No.** field. Otherwise, fill in both the **Account No.** and **Bal. Account No.** fields manually. A positive amount in the **Amount** field is debited to the main account and credited to the balancing account. A negative amount is credited to the main account and debited to the balancing account.

> [!NOTE]  
> VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account, so they can use different VAT percentage rates.

## Work with recurring journals

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. For example, transactions for expenses such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, and heat. Using recurring journals lets you post fixed and variable amounts, and specify automatic reversal entries for the day after the posting date. Allocation keys let you divide the recurring entries among various accounts. Learn more at [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).

With a recurring journal, you create the entries that you post regularly only one time. For example, the accounts, dimensions, dimension values, and so on, stay in the journal after posting. If changes are needed, you can make them each time you post.

### Recurring Method field

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how to treat the amount on the journal line after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time you post the line, you can let the amount remain. If you'll use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time you post, you can delete the amount after posting.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|F Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting. Lines with amounts of zero remain in the journal, but aren't posted. You can update the amount in a later run.  |
|V Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting.|
|B Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line in the Gen. Jnl. Allocation table. The balance on the account is set to zero. Remember to fill in the **Allocation %** field on the **Allocations** page. For more information, see [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).|
|RF Reversing Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RV Reversing Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RB Reversing Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line on the **Allocations** page. The balance on the account is set to zero, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|BD Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to be used to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. As an alternative, choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|
|RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's reversing balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to use to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. You can also choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT fields can be filled in on either the recurring journal line or on the allocation journal line but not on both. That is, they can be filled in on the **Allocations** page only if the corresponding lines in the recurring journal are not filled in.

### Recurring Frequency field

This date formula field determines how often to post the entry on the journal line, and it must be filled in. Learn more at [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

#### Examples

If the journal line must be posted every month, enter **1M**. After every posting, the date in the **Posting Date** field will be updated to the same date in the next month.

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month, you can take one of the following actions:

* Post the first entry on the last day of a month by entering 1D+1M-1D (1 day + 1 month - 1 day). With this formula, the posting date is calculated correctly regardless of how many days there are in the month.

* Post the first entry on any day of the month by entering 1M+CM. With this formula, the posting date will be after one full month + the remaining days of the current month.

### Expiration Date field

This field determines the date on which the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after this date.

The advantage of using the Expiration Date field is that the line isn't deleted from the journal immediately. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future.

If the field is blank, the line is posted every time until you delete it from the journal.

### Allocating recurring journal amounts to several accounts

On the **Recurring General Journals** page, you can choose the **Allocations** action to specify how to allocate amounts on the recurring journal line to several accounts and dimensions. Allocation acts as balancing account line for the recurring journal line.

Like a recurring journal, you enter an allocation one time and it stays in the allocation journal after posting. You don't need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use allocation accounts in journal batches that have an approval workflow for creating journal lines.

If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance** or **Reversing Balance**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are disregarded when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, only one reversing entry is created.

> [!NOTE]
> If you allocate a recurring journal line that contains a dimension value code, don't enter the same code on the **Allocations** page. If you do, the dimension values will be incorrect.  

To allocate recurring journal amounts based on dimensions, set the **Recurring Method** field to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**. If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are considered when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, reversing entries are created that match the number of dimension value combinations that the balance is comprised of. If you allocate account balance through a recurring journal that contains a dimension value code, remember to use **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension** to ensure that the dimension values are correctly balanced or reversed from the source account.  

For example, your company has a couple of business units and a handful of departments that your controllers set up as dimensions. To speed up the purchase invoice entry process, you decide to require the accounts payable clerks to enter only business unit dimensions. Since each business unit has specific allocation keys for the Department dimension, such as based on the number of employees, you can use the **BD Balance by Dimension** or **RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension** recurring methods to reallocate expenses for each business unit to the right departments based on the allocation keys.  

> [!NOTE]
> Dimensions that you set on allocation lines are not automatically calculated, and you must specify which dimension values must be set on the allocation accounts. In case you want to preserve the link between the source account dimension and the allocation account dimension, we recommend that you use the [Cost Accounting](finance-about-cost-accounting.md) capabilities instead.

#### Example: Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments

You pay rent monthly, so you enter the amount on the cash account on a recurring journal line. On the **Allocations** page, you can use the Department dimension to divide the expense among several departments. For example, according to the number of square feet that each department occupies. The calculation is based on the allocation percentage on each line. You can allocate in different ways:

* Enter different accounts on different allocation lines to divide rental expense among several accounts.
* Enter the same account but use different dimension value codes for the Department dimension on each line.

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

### Calculate the reversal date

When using recurring general journals to post accruals at the end of a period, it's important to have full control over reversal entries. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field lets you control the date that reversal entries are posted when reversal recurring methods are used.

#### Example

Accruals are typically posted with **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Balance** recurring methods on the journal line. The posting date of the posted amount on the account on journal line is calculated using the recurring frequency. The posting date for the balancing entry is calculated using the **Reversal Date Calculation** field, as follows:

* If the field is blank, the balancing entry will be posted the next day.
* If the field contains a date formula (for example, **5D** for five days), the balancing entry is posted with a posting date calculated using the reversal date calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field is not available on the **Recurring General Journals** page. To use the field, you must add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Work with standard journals

When you create journal lines that you know you're likely to create again later, you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal. The same applies for item journals and general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals might not contain all of the fields you want to include in the resulting ledger entries. For example, if you're using a standard general journal to register a payment, the ledger entries won't contain the Payment Method Code field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures refer to the item journal, but the information also applies to the general journal.

### To save a standard journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter one or more journal lines.
3. Select the journal lines that you want to reuse.
4. Choose the **Save as Standard Journal** action.
5. In the **Save as Standard Item Journal** request page, define a new or existing standard item journal that the lines should be saved in.

    If you have one or more standard item journals, and you want to replace one of them with the new set of item journal lines, in the **Code** field, select the item journal.
6. Choose **OK** to verify that you want to replace the content of the existing standard item journal.
7. To save the values in the **Unit Amount** field of the standard item journal, choose the **Save Unit Amount** field.
8. To save the values in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Save Quantity** field.
9. Choose **OK** to save the standard item journal.

When you save the standard item journal, the Item Journal page displays so you can post it.

### To reuse a standard journal

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals don't always have the same fields as general journals. When you use the Get Standard Journals action to copy the fields to the general journal, the general journal might have less information than if you created it manually. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Get Standard Journals** action.
3. To review a standard item journal before you select it for reuse, choose the **Show Journal** action.

    Changes you make in a standard item journal are implemented right away, and they'll be there next time you open or reuse the standard item journal. Be sure that the change is important enough to generally apply. Otherwise, make the specific change in the item journal after the standard item journal lines are added. See step 4.
4. On the **Standard Item Journals** page, select the standard item journal to reuse, and then choose **OK**.

    The item journal contains the lines you saved. If the item journal already has lines, the new lines appear after them.

    If you didn't turn on the **Save Unit Amount** toggle when you saved the journal, the **Unit Amount** field on lines added from the standard journal contain the value from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you turned on the **Save Unit Amount** or **Save Quantity** toggles when you saved the journal, make sure the new values are correct before you post the item journal.
    >
    > If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you don't want to post, you can adjust it to the current value of the item.

5. Select the item journal lines you want to adjust, and then choose the **Recalculate Unit Amount** action. This action updates the Unit Amount field with the current unit cost of the item.
6. Choose the **Post** action.

## To renumber document numbers in journals

To avoid posting errors caused by the document number, you can use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action before you post a journal.

In all journals that are based on the general journal, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines or the same document number for related journal lines.

If the **No. Series** field on the journal batch is filled, then the posting function in general journals requires that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines be in sequential order. Just choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action, and relevant **Document No.** fields are then updated. If related journal lines are grouped by document number before you used the function, they remain grouped, but might be assigned a different document number.  

This function also works on filtered views.

Renumbering document numbers respects related applications, such as a payment application made from the document on the journal line to a vendor account. Accordingly, the **Applies-to ID** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields are updated on the ledger entries.

### To renumber documents in journals

The following procedure is based on the **General Journals** page, but applies to all other journals that are based on the general journal, such as the **Payment Journals** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. When you're ready to post the journal, choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action.

Values in the **Document No.** field are changed, where required, so that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines are in sequential order. After documents are renumbered, you can post the journal.

# Understanding WIP methods in project management

As a project progresses, materials, resources, and other expenses are consumed and must be posted to the project. Work in Process (WIP) is a feature that enables you to estimate the financial value of projects in the general ledger while the projects are ongoing. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing a project. When only expenses are posted, your financial statement is inaccurate.

To track the value in the general ledger, you can calculate WIP and post the value to the general ledger. For more information, see [Monitor Project Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md).

Out of the box, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following methods of calculating and recording the value of work in process.

| WIP Method | Description | Recognized Costs | Recognized Sales |
| --- | ------- |--- | --- |
| Cost Value |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales. |Cost Value|Contract (Invoice Price)|
| Cost of Sales |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales.|Cost of Sales|Contract (Invoiced Price)|
| Sales Value |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Sales Value|
| Percentage of Completion |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Percentage of Completion|
| Completed Contract |No sales or costs are part of the WIP calculation. Completed contract doesn't recognize revenue and costs until the project is complete. For example, this option is useful when there's high uncertainty around the estimates of costs and revenue for the project.|At Completion|At Completion|

Exact formulas and general ledger transactions are defined by the selection in the [**Recognized Cost**](#recognized-cost) and [**Recognized Sales**](#recognized-sales) fields.

## Create a project WIP method

Create a project WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a method to create WIP entries, you can't modify or delete the method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, select the appropriate values for the **Recognized Costs** and **Recognized Sales** fields, and then fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **projects setup**, and then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

### Recognized cost

| Recognized Cost | Recognized Cost Calculation Formula | General Ledger Entries |

When project status is changed to Completed, the **Calculate WIP** task reverts the WIP transaction and posts instead.

Dt **Recognized Cost Account** Cr **Project Cost Applied Account** , Amount: **Actual (Total Cost)**

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the selection in the **WIP Posting Method Used** field, the **Item Cost Applied Account**, **Resource Cost Applied Account**, or **G/L Cost Applied Account** could be used instead of **Project Cost Applied Account**. For more information, see [Project posting groups](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#to-set-general-information-for-projects).

### Recognized sales

| Recognized Sales | Recognized Sales Calculation Formula | General Ledger Entries |

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices, to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** check box.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

The status of the price list must be **Draft**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter adjustment in **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** field.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected **Item**.  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them in the **Sales Prices** table, you can use the **Implement Price Changes** batch job, which is found on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

# Set Up Salespeople

Many companies want to follow an individual employee's performance as a basis for calculating the sales commission or bonus. See, for example, the **Salesperson Commissions** report. A company may also want to assign a salesperson to each of their contacts.

When you have set up a salesperson on the **Salespeople** page, you can select it in the **Salesperson Code** field on all relevant records, such as G/L account, customer, vendor, contacts, and campaign cards. Then, when you post or set up invoices, credit memos, journal lines, finance charge activities, and so on, the salesperson code is carried to the resulting ledger entries.

# Summarize records with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. Copilot uses AI to generate two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data tailored to your role in Business Central. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. Interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## How Copilot summarizes your data

Copilot uses fields from the record, information from FactBoxes, and fields from related statistics pages to create a summary. It works on your behalf and can only access data that you can access in Business Central. For example, if you personalize the page to hide a field, Copilot doesn't include that field in the summary. If security controls remove access to specific fields, Copilot doesn't include those fields in summaries.

## Prerequisites

The **Summarize** capability is active, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

This feature is available on most card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**. If it's not available on a page as expected, it might be hidden. [Learn how to show or hide the summary](#show-or-hide-the-summary).

## Summarize a record

1. Open the record.
1. In the **Summary** part at the top of the FactBox pane on the right side, select the ![Shows the down arrow head icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/down-arrow-head.png) **Expand summary** icon to generate the summary.

   ![Shows the Summary part in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-collapsed.svg "Shows the Summary part in the FactBox pane.")

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Summary** part is expanded when the page opens, Copilot generates the summary immediately without your interaction. If the **Summary** is expanded when you close the page, Copilot automatically generates the summary the next time you open the page for a record.

1. The summary appears in a moment for you to review and interact with.

   ![Shows the Summary part opened in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-opened.svg "Shows the Summary part opened in the FactBox pane.")

   Review the summary before making any decisions. The content is AI-generated and might be incorrect or inaccurate.

   - Explore the data

     Summaries are based on data from the record, FactBoxes that display related information, and related pages that show aggregated information like statistics pages. Some summary text is linked, so you can go to the data source. Select the links to view details or take action based on the summarized data.

   - Get more insights

     Select the **Show more** button to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens on the right side and generates more points of interest.

   - Regenerate the summary

     Select the **Regenerate summary** icon to generate a new summary, updated with changes to the record and related data. The same summary appears for a few minutes before a new one is automatically generated, but you can request a summary from the latest data at any time.

## Share the summary  

You can easily share any summary with your coworkers by using the **Copy summary** button, then pasting into your favorite app such as Microsoft Teams chats, Outlook emails, or in your project OneNote. Pasting a summary includes the summary bullet points and a link to the source page in Business Central that you can navigate to the full information.

- To copy the summary from the FactBox, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the bottom of the FactBox, and then select **Copy summary**. The summary is now copied to your clipboard. You can also select or set focus to the FactBox using your keyboard and use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut, then switch apps and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> shortcut to paste.

- To copy the summary from the Copilot pane, hover over the summary message and select **Copy**. The summary is now copied to your clipboard. You can also select or set focus to the summary message and use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut, then switch apps and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> shortcut to paste.

> [!NOTE]
> Summaries are intended for use within your organization and might contain sensitive information. Review the summary carefully before sharing outside of your organization.

## Show or hide the summary

Business Central remembers if you collapsed, expanded, or hid the **Summary** the last time you had the page open.

- To show the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To hide the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the **Summary** part.
- Because the **Summary** part is in the FactBox pane, it's hidden if the FactBox pane is collapsed. To show the FactBox pane, select the ![Shows the icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/expand-factbox-icon.png) **Expand FactBox pane** icon.

# Work with responsibility centers

Responsibility centers provide the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. For example, companies can set up user-specific views of sales and purchase documents related to a particular responsibility center.  

Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in flexible, optimal ways.

Multiple locations allow companies to manage their inventory in multiple locations using one database. Two concepts, locations and stockkeeping units, are the cornerstones of this granule. A location is defined as a place that handles physical placement and quantities of items. The concept is broad enough to include locations such as plants or production facilities and distribution centers, warehouses, showrooms, and service vehicles. A stockkeeping unit is defined as an item at a specific location and/or as a variant. Using stockkeeping units, companies with multiple locations can add replenishment information, addresses, and some financial posting information at the location level. As a result, they can replenish variants of the same item for each location and order items based on location-specific replenishment information.  

## To set up a responsibility center

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If you're using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
5. On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field, enter a responsibility center code.

This code is used on all purchase, sales, or service documents, if the user, customer, or vendor has no default responsibility center. On sales, purchase, or service documents, you can enter another responsibility center than the default.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.  

## To assign responsibility centers to users

You can set up users so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  

To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas: Purchases, Sales, and Service Management.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **User Setup** page, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
3. In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to sales.  
4. In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to purchasing.  
5. In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to service management.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users can view only those posted documents that related to their own responsibility center. However, they can view all ledger entries and navigate to other posted documents from the ledger entries.

# Set up company consolidation

Before you can consolidate the general ledger entries of two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company, you must prepare the charts of accounts and the consolidation company.  

Depending on the complexity of your businesses, there are two ways to set up consolidation:

* If you don't need advanced settings, such as including a company that you only own part of, you can use the **Company Consolidation** setup guide to quickly set-up a consolidation. The guide helps you through the basic steps.
* If you need more advanced settings, you can set up the consolidated company and business units yourself.
  * In each business unit, specify the general ledger accounts to include in the consolidation and the translation method for each account.
  * In the consolidated company, set up a business unit card for each company to include in the consolidation. The business unit card includes information such as the dates of the business unit's fiscal year, and the percentage of each account to include in the consolidation.

## Simple consolidation setup

If your consolidation is straightforward, for example because you wholly own the business units to consolidate, the **Company Consolidation** guide helps you through the following steps:

* Create a new consolidated company, or consolidate a company you already created. The company shouldn't contain transactions.
* Preview the results. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that you can successfully transfer the master data and transactions to the consolidated company.

To use the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Process Consolidations**, and then complete each step in the Company Consolidation assisted setup guide.

## Advanced consolidation setup

If you need more advanced settings for your consolidation, you can set up consolidation manually. For example, if you have companies that you partially own, or you have companies that you don't want to include.  

### Set up the consolidated company

First, you must set up the consolidated company. You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. To learn more about setting up a company, go to [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

The following list illustrates key aspects of the consolidated company.

1. Set up the chart of accounts.

    To learn more about setting up a chart of accounts, go to [Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

    The charts of accounts can be identical across a business unit and the consolidated company, or the consolidated company can have a different chart of account. If a business unit's chart of accounts differs from the consolidated company's, you must map the accounts to the accounts in the business unit. To learn more, go to the [Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation](#glacc) section.

2. Add business units.

    To consolidate several companies' data, you must set up the subsidiaries as business units and specify how much of their balances to include. To learn more about business units, to go the [Add business units](#busunit) section.

3. Specify exchange rates, if needed.

    Specify exchange rates if you consolidate data for business units that use different currencies. The exchange rates you can use are **Average Rate (Manual)** and **Closing Rate**. To learn more about exchange rates, go to [Specify exchange rates for consolidations](#exchrates).

4. Consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

    To learn more, go to the [Include or exclude dimensions](#dim) section.

### <a name="busunit"></a>Add business units

In the consolidated company, set up each company that you want to consolidate data from as a business unit. Before you run a consolidation and generate your consolidation report, it's a good idea to verify the financial data in each business unit.

A significant part of setting up the business unit is to specify how the unit shares it's financial data with the consolidated company. There are manual and automated options:

* To use a manual process, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises, you can export an .xml file that contains the unit's general ledger entries. Then import the file in the consolidated company.
* To automate the data exchange, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online you can use an API that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides to share data across environments. If your companies are in the same environment, you can use the **Database** option.

> [!NOTE]
> The API option also lets you share general ledger entries from other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. To use the API option, the user who configures the consolidation must have permission to access G/L entries. For example, the D365 Basic and D365 Read permission sets provide access.

#### Set up business unit currencies

When you run consolidation for business units in a foreign currency, pay attention to the exchange rates that various parts of the process use. This is especially true when you rerun consolidation. Use the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page to easily keep track of the rates.

The **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page gives you the last rates for average and closing. You can look up the exchange rates in the currency exchange rate table, which makes it easier to validate rates. You can change the rates for the current run by entering the values or copying them from previous runs. To copy rates, choose **Select from previous consolidation**. This page is valuable when you want to rerun a previous consolidation and use a previous closing rate. This step helps to correctly revaluate your balance sheet items. The **Select from previous consolidation** page is also useful if you just want to view the rates that were used, for example, when you're troubleshooting. The page is filtered to runs that included the selected business unit.

You start the **Run Consolidation** batch job from the **Business Units** list page. You can also find the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page by choosing the **Exchange Rates** action.

> [!NOTE]
> The exchange rate setup pages for average and closing that are currently available on the **Business Unit** card will be deprecated in a future version. However, you can still maintain these rates if you have business units that you import through files.

#### Create a business unit

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields on the **General** and **G/L Accounts** FastTabs. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, make sure you comply with GAAP rules concerning the fiscal periods of the business unit versus the parent company.
4. On the **Data Import** FastTab, in the **Default Data Import** field, specify how you share general ledger entries with the consolidated company:

   * To share data between companies in the same environment, choose **Database**.
   * To share data between companies in different environments, choose **API**, and then fill in the **API's Endpoint** field.
        
        To get the endpoint URL, in the business unit company's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Consolidation Setup Page** and check the Current environment's API Endpoint field value. 
   * To export an .xml file and manually share it, choose **File Format**.

### <a name="glacc"></a>Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation

The chart of accounts for a company that you will consolidate must specify accounts for consolidation. For each posting general ledger account in each company, you must specify the general ledger account in the consolidated company to transfer the balance to. This mapping lets you consolidate companies that have different charts of accounts.

If the chart of accounts in the business unit differs from the consolidated company, you must prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation. You can specify the accounts to post debits and credits to, and the method to use to translate currencies in the consolidated company.

1. In each business unit's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the account, and then fill in the fields on the **Consolidation** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Consol. Debit Acc.** and **Consol. Credit Acc.** fields, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes they're mapped to the same accounts in the consolidated company.

> [!TIP]
> There might be scenarios where you don't want to include an account in a consolidation. For example, if you want your consolidation company to reflect only the balance sheets from the subsidiary companies. To exclude an account from consolidation, turn on the **Exclude from Consolidation** toggle for the account.

### <a name="exchrates"></a>Specify exchange rates for consolidations

If a business unit uses a different currency than the consolidated company, you must specify exchange rate methods for each account before you consolidate. For each account, the content of the **Consol. Translation Method** field determines the exchange rate. In the consolidated company, on each business unit card, in the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field you specify whether consolidation uses exchange rates from the business unit or the consolidated company. If you use exchange rates from the consolidated company, you can change the exchange rates for a business unit. For business units, if the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field on the business unit card contains **Local**, you can change the exchange rate from the business unit card. The exchange rates are copied from the **Currency Exchange Rate** table, but you can change them before consolidating.

The following table describes the exchange rate methods you can use for accounts.

|Exchange rate | Typical use |
|---|---|
|Average Rate (Manual) | You manually calculate the average rate for the period to consolidate. Calculate the average either as an arithmetic average or as a best estimate, and specify the result for each business unit. Use for income statement accounts.|
|Closing Rate | Used for balance sheet accounts.|
|Historical Rate | The exchange rate that was valid when the transaction occurred.|
|Composite Rate | The current period amounts are translated at the average rate and added to the previously recorded balance in the consolidated company. You typically use this method for retained earnings accounts. Those accounts include amounts from different periods, so they contain amounts translated with different exchange rates.|
|Equity Rate | This option is similar to **Composite**. Differences post to separate general ledger accounts.|

To specify exchange rates for a business unit, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Business Unit List** page, choose the business unit, and then choose the **Exchange Rates** action.  
3. On the **Setup Business Unit Currencies** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### <a name="dim"></a>Include or exclude dimensions

You can consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

* On the dimensions, specify the **Consolidation Code** field, or leave it blank.
  * To exclude a dimension in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank on the dimension, and don't choose dimensions in the **Copy Dimensions** fields in any consolidation functions or reports.
  * To include dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank. However, the consolidation works only if the dimension values in the business unit are the same as the consolidated company.
  * To consolidate the dimension value code in the business unit with a different dimension value code in the consolidated company, fill in the **Consolidation Code** field on the dimensions.  
* Add the dimensions to the general ledger accounts.

### <a name="exclude"></a>Exclude a company from consolidation

If you don't want to include a business unit in the consolidation, you can exclude it. To do that, go to the business unit card, and clear the **Consolidate** checkbox.

### <a name="include"></a>Include a partially owned company in consolidation

If you own only part of a company, you can include a percentage of each transaction that reflects the percentage you own. For example, if you own 70% of the company, consolidation includes $70 of an invoice for $100. To specify the percentage of the company you own, go to the business unit card and enter the percentage in the **Consolidation %** field.

# Reverse journal postings and undo receipts/shipments

Reverse journal postings are useful, for example, for correcting errors and for clearing out an old accruals entry before entering a new one. A reverse entry is the same as the original entry, but has an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The reverse entry must have the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After you reverse an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed one time.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they're posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you posted an incorrect negative quantity, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, as received but not invoiced, you can undo the posting.

If you posted an incorrect positive quantity as shipped but not invoiced, you can undo the posting. For example, if you posted a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items.

> [NOTE!]
> Due to how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts and updates amounts in an additional reporting currency (ACY), you can't use this feature if you use ACY. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts amounts in local currency to the alternate currency, but doesn't net transactions. If you use ACY, you must manually reverse the amounts.

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry

You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry must originate from a journal posting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Reverse Transaction** action.
3. On the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page, choose the **Reverse** action.
4. Choose **Yes** to confirm the reversal.

## To post a negative entry  

Use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. By default, the field is available in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

## To undo a quantity on a posted purchase receipt  

The following steps describe how to undo a posted receipt of items or resources. The steps are similar for posted shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted receipt that you want to undo.  
3. Select the line or lines that you want to undo.  
4. Choose **Undo Receipt** action.

A corrective line is added under the selected receipt line. If the quantity was received in a warehouse receipt, then a corrective line is added on the posted warehouse receipt.  

The **Quantity Received** and **Qty. Rcd. Not Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order are set to zero.

## To undo and then redo a quantity on a posted return shipment

The following steps describe how to:

* Undo a posted return shipment of items or resources.
* Repost the purchase return with a new quantity.

The steps are similar for posted return receipts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Return Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted return shipment to undo.
3. Select the line or lines to undo.  

4. Choose the **Undo Return Shipment** action.  

    A corrective line is inserted in the posted document, and the **Return Qty. Shipped** and **Return Shpd. Not Invd.** fields on the return order are set to zero.  

    Now go back to the purchase return order and redo the posting.  

5. On the **Posted Return Shipment** page, take a note of the number in the **Return Order No.** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then select the related link.  
7. Open the return order in question, and then choose the **Reopen** action.  
8. Correct the entry in the **Quantity** field and post the purchase return order again.  

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

## Reverse a customer and vendor ledger entry with a realized gain or loss entry

You can use the **Reverse transaction** action to reverse payments that were applied to entries that originated in foreign currencies and were adjusted using the Exchange Rate Adjustment batch job. The feature works for both purchases and sales.

The following steps are a simple scenario that illustrates how it works:

1. Post a sales invoice for a customer using a foreign currency.
2. Adjust the exchange rate for that currency.
3. Post a payment applied to the invoice.
4. Unapply and reverse the payment transaction, for example, from the **Customer Ledger Entries** page.

# Managing Sales Opportunities
Any incoming lead can be considered a sales opportunity. You can create opportunities and associate them to a salesperson so that you can keep track of potential sales.

Before you can start using opportunity management, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. As you create opportunities, you should provide information about the contact, salesperson, sales cycle, and dates, as well as your estimates for the sales value of the opportunity and your estimation of the chances of its success.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Set up intercompany transactions

Intercompany partnerships make it easier to handle accounting processes when two or more subsidiaries of a company frequently do business with each other. Partners can exchange transactions, such as sales and purchases, and handle them either manually or automatically. For example, when a partner sends a sales journal line to another partner, a purchase journal line is created for the receiving partner.

The intercompany chart of accounts can be, for example, a version of the synchronization partner's chart of accounts. Each partner maps their accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Each partner also maps their dimensions and dimension values to the intercompany dimensions.

## Before you start

Before you start to set up your intercompany partnership, there are a few decisions to make.

|Decision  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Which chart of accounts should be the basis for the intercompany chart of accounts?     | All companies in the partnership must use the same intercompany chart of accounts. You can base your intercompany chart of accounts on the chart of accounts from one of the companies in the partnership, or create a new intercompany chart of accounts. You map the accounts to use in the partnership in both ways, so that each partner both sends and receives transactions in the correct accounts. Learn more about setting up the intercompany chart of accounts at [Set up the intercompany charts of accounts](#set-up-the-intercompany-charts-of-accounts).         |
|Which dimensions should be the basis for the intercompany dimensions?     | If you use intercompany dimensions, they must be the same for all companies in the partnership. After you specify your intercompany dimensions, map their dimension values. Learn more about mapping dimension values at [Set up intercompany dimensions](#set-up-intercompany-dimensions).        |
|Which partners are customers or vendors, or both?     |  Learn more about setting up customers and vendor companies in an intercompany partnership at [Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors](#set-up-intercompany-partners-as-customers-and-vendors).       |
|Do you want to specify bank accounts to use in the partnership?| You can speed up the process of registering payment transactions by specifying the bank account to use for each partner company. Learn more at [Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners](#specify-bank-accounts-for-intercompany-partners). |
|How do you want to identify the companies in the partnership?     | All parties must agree on a unique intercompany partner identification code for each company. You assign the code to customer and vendor cards to identify related transactions. Learn more about identifiers at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).        |
|How do you want to handle item numbers?     | If intercompany lines contain items, you can either use your own item numbers, or you can set up your partner's item numbers for each item, either in the **Vendor Item No.** field or in the **Common Item No.** field on the item card. You can also use the **Item Reference** action to map your items' numbers to your intercompany partners descriptions of the items. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).        |
|Are resources involved?     | If intercompany sales transactions include resources, fill in the **IC Partner Purch. G/L Acc. No.** field on the resource card for each resource. The field contains the number of the intercompany general ledger account that the amount for this resource posts to in the partner company. To learn more about resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).<br><br>**NOTE**<br>Intercompany purchase transactions that include resources, fixed assets, and item charges aren't fully supported. In the partner company, the **Line Type** field is blank on purchase document lines that include these entities. You must manually update the field.        |

## Overview of the steps to get started

Use the **Intercompany Setup** page to set up the following components of intercompany transactions:

* Your company's intercompany settings.
* The company that is the synchronization partner.
* The intercompany chart of accounts that all partners use to exchange transactions.
* The mappings between accounts in the chart of accounts and intercompany chart of accounts for inbound and outbound transactions for each partner.
* The intercompany dimensions and dimension values to use, and how they're mapped to dimensions for each partner.
* The companies that are the intercompany partners.
* The companies that are vendors or customers, or both.

## Set up a synchronization partner

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts and, if needed, the same intercompany dimensions. You can save time when you set up the partnership by using the chart of accounts and dimensions for one of the partners as a baseline for the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. The company that you use as the baseline is called the *synchronization partner*. Typically, the synchronization partner is the headquarter company, but it doesn't have to be.

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, each partner specifies the synchronization partner in the **Synchronization Partner** field. Afterward, the intercompany chart of accounts and intercompany dimensions are automatically specified for them, based on the setup for the synchronization partner. The partners then use the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts Mapping** and **Intercompany Dimension Mapping** pages to map their chart of accounts and dimensions to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and vice versa. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to map accounts and dimensions in both directions. That is, both to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and from them to your own accounts and dimensions.

### Connect with partners in another tenant or environment

If one or more partners' [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in another tenant or environment, there are a few extra steps to create the connection. The steps apply to all partners in another tenant or environment.

* Set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a registered app in Azure portal.
* Add and enable the app registration in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Exchange information about their intercompany setups. Each partner can get this information from the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**.

   |Copy from the partner's setup  |Copy to your setup  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Current Connection URL     |IC Partner's Connection URL         |
   |Current Company ID     |IC Partner's Company ID         |
   |Intercompany ID     |IC Partner's Intercompany ID         |
   |Company Name     |IC Partner's Company Name         |

* Exchange the following authentication settings so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can authenticate when it connects. Each partner can get this information from their registered app. To learn more about how to create a registered app, go to [Create a registered app in Azure portal](#create-a-registered-app-in-azure-portal).  

  * Client ID
  * Client secret
  * Token endpoint
  * Redirect URL

Run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details** in all companies to specify the information.

#### Create a registered app in Azure portal

This process is only necessary if you want to connect with a partner whose [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in a different tenant or environment.

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to have a text editor open, such as Notepad, while you create your registered app. You'll need some of the information when you run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**, so it's nice to have the information handy.

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. Choose the **Microsoft Entra ID** service.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **App registrations**.
4. On the **App registrations** page, choose **new registration**.
5. Give the application a name.
6. Choose the **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)** account type.
7. For the redirect URI, in the **Select a platform** field, choose **Web**, and then provide the URI. For example, \**https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm**.

  If you're working with an embed ISV, you might need a different URI.

8. Register the app.
9. On the **Intercompany App** page, on the navigation pane, choose **API permissions**.
10. Choose the **Add a permission** action.
11. On the **Microsoft APIs** tab, choose **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.
12. On the **Request API Permissions** pane, choose **Application permissions**, and then choose the **API.ReadWrite.All** permission.
13. On the **Intercompany App | API permissions** page, choose the **Grant admin consent for Contoso** action, and then grant consent.
14. On the navigation pane, choose **Certificates & secrets**.
15. Choose the **Client secrets** tab, and then choose **New client secret**.
16. On the **Add a client secret** pane, enter a name for the secret, and specify when it expires.

  > [!NOTE]
  > All partners who are in different environments must renew the secret before it expires.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Copy the ID in the **Value** field before you leave the **Intercompany App | Certificates & secrets** page. You'll need it in a later step, and it won't be available after you leave the page. For example, paste the value in a text editor.

17. On the navigation pane, choose **Overview**.
18. Copy the value in the **Application (client) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
19. Choose the **Endpoints** action, and then copy the value in the **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
20. Copy the value in the **Directory (tenant) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
21. In the token value you copied, replace **organizations** with the value you copied from the **Directory (tenant) ID** field in the previous step.

## Set up the intercompany charts of accounts

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts, and map the accounts in their own chart of accounts to it. If the chart of accounts for your company defines the intercompany chart of accounts for your partner companies, follow the steps in this section.

If you're using an XML file that contains the intercompany chart of accounts, follow the steps in [Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts](intercompany-how-setup.md#import-or-export-an-intercompany-chart-of-accounts).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. To add accounts, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each account on a line on the page.  
    * If your intercompany chart of accounts is identical or similar to your regular chart of accounts, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Chart of Accounts** action. You can edit the new lines as needed.
    * If you set up an intercompany chart of accounts for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those accounts.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany chart of accounts from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany accounts with any changes the partner makes to theirs.

The next step is to map your chart of accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Learn more at [Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts](#map-the-intercompany-chart-of-accounts-to-your-companys-chart-of-accounts).

### Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts

The synchronization company can share its chart of accounts with partners by exporting it to a file. Partners can import the file to get the chart of accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.  

The **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page is filled with new or edited G/L account lines according to the intercompany chart of accounts in the file. Any existing, unrelated lines on the page remain unchanged.

## Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts  

After you define or import the intercompany chart of accounts, map each intercompany account with one of your accounts. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, you specify how intercompany G/L accounts on incoming transactions map to G/L accounts from your company's chart of accounts.

If the intercompany accounts and your accounts have the same numbers, you can map the accounts automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > To access the actions on the page, you might need to expand the page to the wide layout view.

3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Chart of Accounts Mapping** action.
4. You can map the accounts manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Chart of Account** and **G/L Chart of Accounts** panes, choose an account, and then choose an account in the **G/L No.** and **IC No.** fields.
    * To automatically map accounts that have the same numbers, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map to Acc. with Same No** action, and then choose the chart of accounts to update.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all accounts, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

## Set up intercompany dimensions

If partners exchange transactions with dimensions linked to them, agree on the dimensions that all of you use. For example, the synchronization company can create a simplified version of their dimensions, export them to an XML file, and then distribute the file to each partner. Each partner can import the XML file on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page and then map the intercompany dimensions to their dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

> [!NOTE]
> Each company must map their dimensions to the intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents and incoming documents. Mapping accounts in both directions is important, and helps maintain consistency across the companies.

If partners use the synchronization partner's intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in this section. If you want to share using an XML file that contains the intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in [Import or export intercompany dimensions](#import-or-export-intercompany-dimensions).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. To add dimensions, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each dimension on a line.  
    * If your intercompany dimensions are identical or similar to your regular dimensions, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Dimensions** action. Afterward, you can edit the lines as needed.
    * If you specify intercompany dimensions for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those dimensions.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany dimensions from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany dimensions with any changes the partner makes to theirs.  

### Import or export intercompany dimensions  

The synchronization company can share its dimensions with partners by exporting them to a file. Partners can import the file to get the dimensions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.  
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.

The next step is to map the dimensions with the intercompany dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

### Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions

After you specify the dimensions you use, map each intercompany dimension with one of your company's dimensions, and vice versa. Use the **Intercompany Dimensions Mapping** page to specify the mapping. Afterward, repeat the process for the dimension values.

* Specify how intercompany dimensions on incoming transactions map to dimensions from your company's list of dimensions.
* Specify how your dimensions translate to intercompany dimensions on *outgoing transactions*.

If any of the intercompany dimensions have the same code as the corresponding dimensions in your company, you can automatically map the dimensions.  

In the following steps, you first map intercompany dimensions to dimensions for incoming documents in the **Intercompany Dimensions** pane. Then, you map dimensions to intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents on the **Current Company Dimensions** pane.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Dimensions Mapping** action.
4. You can map the dimensions manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Dimensions** and **Current Company Dimensions** panes, choose a dimension, and then choose a dimension in the **Dim. Code** and **IC Dim. Code** fields.
    * To automatically map dimensions that have the same code, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map dimensions with same code** action, and then choose the dimensions to update. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all dimensions, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

5. Choose the **Dimension Values Mapping** action.
6. On the **Intercompany Dimension Values Mapping** page, the steps to create the mapping are similar to what you just did for dimensions.

## Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches

You must set up a general journal template and a general journal batch to use by default for intercompany transactions. The template and batch are especially important if you automatically accept intercompany transactions from your partners. To learn more about autoaccepting transactions, go to [Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners](#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).

* General journals are used to post to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, and vendor accounts. Posting with a general journal always creates entries on general ledger accounts. Use the **Intercompany General Journal** page to set up the general journal batch to use. The settings that are specific to intercompany transactions are the accounts you specify in the **IC Account Type** and **IC Account No** fields.
* Journal templates give you a journal page designed for a specific purpose. That is, the fields in journal templates are exactly the ones needed for a particular part of the program. Use the **General Journal Templates** page to set up a template to use for intercompany transactions.

To learn more about general journal templates and batches, go to [Use journal templates and batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Set up a company for intercompany transactions

The following steps assume that a synchronization partner is set up with the chart of accounts and dimensions on which you base the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. You can set them up yourself, but it's typically faster to get started, and maintenance is easier, to you use a synchronization partner. To learn more about the synchronization partner, go to [Set up a synchronization partner](#set-up-a-synchronization-partner).

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab on the **Intercompany Setup** page for each partner before you add their partners. When you add partner companies that are in the same tenant, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets their IC code and company name from their setup on the General FastTab. The **Company Name** field will verify that their IC code is unique.

> [!NOTE]
> If you'll use a synchronization partner, leave the **Synchronization Partner** field blank when you set that company up for the partnership.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Setup** page, fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't use file locations to transfer transactions to your partners because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't access your local network. Therefore, if you choose **File Location** in the **Transfer Type** field, the **Folder Path** field is not available. Instead, the file will be downloaded to the **Downloads** folder on your computer. You then send the file to someone in the partner company, for example, by email. For a more direct process, we recommend that you choose **Email**.

The next step is to set up the partner companies.

## Set up intercompany partners

Each partner must add all other companies in the partnership as a partner.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, choose **Add**.
3. In the **Transfer Type** field, specify how you send data to the partner.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **File Location** option works only for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

4. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all companies in the partnership.

> [!NOTE]
> For intercompany posting, if you turn on the **Auto. Accept Transaction** toggle on the **Intercompany Partner** page [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suppresses messages that warn about purchase invoices duplicating the original purchase order. It's important to have a business process for managing duplicates. For example, by deleting such purchase orders when the purchase invoice is received from the intercompany partner.

### Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, open the card page for the partner.
3. Depending on what you want to do, choose the customer or partner in the **Customer No.** or **Vendor No.** fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the customer or vendor hasn't been created, you can choose **+New** in the drop-down menu to set them up. To learn more about creating customers and vendors, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md) and [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also specify a customer or vendor as an intercompany partner by filling in the **IC Partner Code** field on the **Customer Card** and **Vendor Card** pages.

### Set up default intercompany partner general ledger accounts  

On the **G/L Account Card** page, for accounts that you regularly use on outgoing intercompany sales or purchase lines, you can specify a default intercompany partner general ledger account. For example, for your receivables accounts, you can enter the corresponding payables accounts from the intercompany chart of accounts. The receivables and payables accounts are used as the off-setting account for the intercompany partner when you post transactions on intercompany general journals.  

Then, when you enter a general ledger account in the **Bal. Account No.** field on an intercompany line with **Intercompany Partner** in the **Account Type** field, the **IC Partner G/L Account** field is automatically filled in.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the G/L account that's used for intercompany transactions, and in the **Default IC Partner G/L Account** field, enter the intercompany general ledger account that your partner post to when you post to the general ledger account on the line.
3. Repeat step 2 for each account that you often enter in the **Bal. Account No.** field on a line in an intercompany journal or document.

### Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners

To make it faster to process intercompany transactions, you can specify that you want to automatically create journal lines based on an intercompany partner's posts from the **IC General Journal** page. To autocreate incoming and outgoing transactions, you must turn on the following toggles for each partner:

* On the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle for the synchronization partner. Then specify where to create received intercompany journal transactions by filling in the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** and **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Batch** fields.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** field is blank, you need to set up a general journal template to use for your intercompany general journals. To learn more about templates and batches, go to [Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches](#set-up-intercompany-general-journal-templates-and-batches)    

* On the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto Accept Transactions** toggle.

The journal lines are created for you, but not posted.

### Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners

To facilitate fast payments, specify one or more bank accounts to use for intercompany partners. When a partner uses an intercompany general journal to make a payment, they can specify the bank account on the line. The bank account is used as the balancing account in the receiving company, which minimizes the need to manually enter transactions.

* To specify the bank account to use, on the **Intercompany Partners** page, choose the **Bank Accounts** action. On the **Intercompany Bank Account Card**, enter the account information.

## Troubleshoot your intercompany setup

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, the **Intercompany Setup Diagnostics** pane contains tiles that indicate whether all of the components needed to exchange intercompany transactions are set up. The tiles are also available on the Business Manager Role Center. Choose the tiles to find out what's missing. For an overview of the required components, go to [Overview of the steps to get started](#overview-of-the-steps-to-get-started).

# Manage project supplies

You should manage project supplies of items, services, and expenses as an integral part of all projects. You can use inventory quantities or make project-specific purchases through purchase orders or purchase invoices. For example, when service on a computer requires a new disk, you create a purchase invoice to buy a new disk and record the project that uses it.

If the purchase process doesn't require you to record the physical transaction separately, you can process a purchase on the **Project G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [To post a project-related expense](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md#to-post-a-project-related-expense).

## Manual or semi-automated replenishment

If you already know which supplies you need to replenish for a project, you can create a purchase order. To learn more, go to [Manual or semi-automated replenishment](#manual-or-semi-automated-replenishment).

However, if you aren't sure what you're missing, you can use a semi-automated process where you create a purchase order directly from a project. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps by listing all items and shows whether they're available or unavailable. You can adjust the quantities to replenish on the lines.  

The semi-automated process creates a purchase order for each vendor from which you purchase the items, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page. You can continue to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines.

Later, you can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action. To learn more, go to [Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project](#use-a-semi-automated-replenishment-process-for-a-project).

> [!NOTE]
> As in other cases that involve advanced inventory processes, such as reservation, warehousing, and assemble-to-order, the project's status must be **Open** and the **Apply Usage Link** toggle must be turned on.

### Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a project that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.
4. The **Create Purchase Orders** page shows a line for each item on the project. Lines for both fully available quantities and unavailable quantities show by default. To show only unavailable quantities, choose the **Show Unavailable** action.
5. The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable quantity. To purchase a different quantity, edit the value in the field.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on unavailable lines, even though they represent fully available quantities.

6. You can also turn on the **Reserve** toggle if you want to reserve the quantity on the purchase line against a demand instead of filling out the **Project No.** and **Project Task NO.** fields on the purchase line. By default, the **Reserve** toggle is hidden on the page. You can personalize the page to add the toggle. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
7. Select **OK**.

You can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action.

### Replenish a project manually

The following procedure shows how to use a purchase invoice to purchase products for a project. The same steps apply when using a purchase order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action and fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. In the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields, select the information of the project that you want to purchase items or services for. Use the personalization tools if a field isn't visible. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    The value that you select in the **Project Line Type** field defines whether a planning line is created when you post the usage of the item. If the field contains **Billable**, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. To learn more, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md).

### How posting purchases affects inventory and WIP

When you post a receipt, the inventory is received and immediately written-off by an item ledger entry of the type **Negative Adjustment**. To avoid affecting WIP calculation, the project ledger entries don't include purchase order lines that aren't of the type **G/L Account**.

Project ledger entries are created as follows:

* From a purchase order, when you choose the **Post** action and choose **Invoice**.
* From a purchase invoice, when you choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action on the **Lines** FastTab, and then the **Post** action.

### To view the value of purchases for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.

    On the **Tasks** FastTab, the **Outstanding Orders** field shows the total outstanding amount, in local currency, of inventory items and services on purchase documents for the project task line.  

    The **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced** field shows the value of items delivered on purchase documents but not invoiced.  
3. Choose either of the fields to open the **Purchase Lines** page where you can review information about the related purchase document lines, including which items or services are received.

## To post a project-related expense

If you incur extraordinary or one-time project expenses, you can use the **Project G/L Journal** page to post them directly to the relevant project account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line and enter information about the expense, including information in the **Project No.** and **Project Task No** fields.  
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

## Receive items for projects with warehouse receipts or put-aways

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers advanced warehouse handling for purchase orders that are linked to projects. Save some time by using warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways to directly receive and register usage of items for projects.

Use the following methods to receive items:

- Post receipt and consumption from the order line.
- Post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document.
- Post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document.

### To post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document

When your location is set up to require processing put-aways but not receipts, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your purchase orders.

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:

- Create the inventory put-away directly from the purchase order by choosing the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
- Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement** batch job.
- Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the purchase orders to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document on the **Inventory Put-away** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If bins are mandatory for the location, make sure that the **Bin Code** is filled in the purchase order lines.

### To post the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.
1. Enter the quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.
1. After you put away the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines that were put away. There are two item ledger entries for each line. One entry for receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project. There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice. If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

### To post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document

You must get the lines from the released purchase order that the receipt is for. You can create warehouse receipts in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action on the **Purchase Order** page to create warehouse receipt for a source document.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action on the **Purchase Order** page to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a warehouse receipt for one or more released source documents.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use bins, the default bin is suggested. You can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in.

### To post the warehouse receipt

1. On the **Warehouse Receipts** page, open the warehouse receipt.
1. The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed.
1. After you received the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines. There are two item ledger entries for each receipt line. One entry for the receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project.

There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice.

If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Warehouse put-away documents aren't created, even if your warehouse processes require both receipt and warehouse put-away.

### Good to know

- Return orders aren't supported for locations with directed put-away and pick. You need to undo consumption via a project journal, and then create return order for items in inventory.
- If purchase documents were created before the update, you can post them directly. If you want to use warehouse handling, reopen and release the purchase orders again.
- You can't edit the **No.**, **Variant Code**, **Project No.**, and **Project Task No.** fields on purchase lines if warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways exist.

# Project Invoiced Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Invoiced Sales by Customer** report breaks down your sales values for each project and highlights customer sales.

This report can show you key information about the customers you sell to the most, and which projects generate the sales.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Invoiced Sales by Customer Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.png":::

## Use the report

The report is typically used by project managers, but leadership can also use it to view your high-volume customers.

Project managers use the report to track sales to each customer for each individual project. The report helps you monitor the performance of each project and identify potential issues if you aren't meeting quota for a customer or you're over spending.

# Auditing changes

A common challenge in many business management applications is avoiding unwanted changes in data. It could be anything from an incorrect customer telephone number to an incorrect posting to the general ledger. This article describes the capabilities for finding out what changed, who changed it, and when the change was made.

## About the Change Log

The change log lets you track all direct modifications a user makes to data in the database. You specify each table and field that you want the system to log, and then you activate the change log. The change log is based on changes that are made to data in the tables that you track. On the **Change Log Entries** page, entries are chronologically ordered and show all changes that are made to the values in fields on the tables you specify.

Tracking changes can affect performance, which can cost you time, and increase the size of your database, which might cost you money. To reduce those costs, keep the following things in mind:

- Use caution when choosing the tables and operations.
- Don't add ledger entries and posted documents. Instead, prioritize system fields such as Created By and Created Date.
- Don't use the **All Fields** tracking type. Instead, choose **Some Fields** and track only the most important fields.

> [!NOTE]
> The Change Log doesn't track changes for fields that use the `autoIncrement property`. An example of a field that uses the property is the Integer field on the Error Messages and VAT Report Line tables.

Also for performance reasons, the change log is turned off during the process of upgrading [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the next version. In addition to speeding up the upgrade process, turning off the log also helps reduce clutter in the change log. As soon as the upgrade is complete, the log starts tracking changes again.

> [!Important]
> Changes display in the **Change Log Entries** only after the user's session is restarted, which happens as follows:
>
> - The session expired and was refreshed.
> - The user selected another company or Role Center.
> - The user signed out and signed in again.

## Setting up the Change Log

On the **Change Log Setup** page, you can turn on or turn off the change log. When you do, the activity is logged, so you can always see who made the change.

On the **Change Log Setup** page, if you choose the **Tables** action, you can specify which tables you want to track changes for, and which changes to track. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also tracks several system tables.

> [!NOTE]
> You can monitor specific fields for changes, such as fields that contain sensitive data, by setting up field monitoring. If you do, to avoid redundancy the table that contains the field will not be available for the change log setup. For more information, see [Monitor Sensitive Fields](across-log-changes.md#monitor-sensitive-fields).

After you set up the change log, activated it, and made a change to data, you can view and filter the changes on the **Change Log Entries** page. If you want to delete entries, set up a retention policy, where you can set filters based on dates and time. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).  

## Analyze data in the Change Log

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data in the Change Log from the [Change Log Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=595) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Who changed what data, and when," or "Data changes by table/field," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### Change Log ad-hoc analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing change log can help you monitor and audit important changes.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Who changed what data, and when](#example-who-changed-what-data-and-when) | See who changed what data. | [Change Log Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=595&layout=analysis) | **User ID**, **Date and Time**, **Table Caption**, **Field Caption**, **Primary Key Value 2**, **Primary Key Value 3**, **Type of Change**, **Old Value**, and **New Value**. |
| [Data changes by table/field](#example-data-changes-by-tablefield) | See data changes by table/field, and who made the change. | [Change Log Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=595&layout=analysis) | **Table Caption**, **Field Caption**, **User ID**, **Date and Time**, **Primary Key Value 2**, **Primary Key Value 3**, **Type of Change**, **Old Value**, and **New Value**. |

### Example: Who changed what data, and when

To analyze Who changed What data When, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Change Log Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=595&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **User ID** field (who did it) to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Now choose the following fields:
   - To show when it happened, choose **Date and Time**.
   - To show the table where it happened, choose **Table Caption**. 
   - To show which field, choose **Field Caption**.
   - To show the field code, choose **Primary Key Value 2**. 
   - To show the company name, choose **Primary Key Value 3**.
   - To show whether the change was an insert, update, or delete action, choose **Type of Change**.
   - To show the change, choose **Old Value** and **New Value**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Who changed what data when**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source=" media/data-analysis-change-log-entries-Who-changed-What-data-When.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Change Log Entries page (Who changed What data When)." lightbox="media/data-analysis-change-log-entries-Who-changed-What-data-When.png":::

### Example: data changes by table/field

To analyze data changes by table/field, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Change Log Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=595&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Table Caption** (on what table), and **Field Caption** (on which field) fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Now choose the following fields:
   - To show when it happened, choose **Date and Time**
   - To show who made the change, choose **User ID**.
   - To show the code for the field, choose **Primary Key Value 2**.
   - To show the company name, choose **Primary Key Value 3** (typically the company name), 
   - To show whether the change was an insert, update, or delete action, choose **Type of Change**.
   - To show the change, choose **Old Value** and **New Value**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Data changes by table + field**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source=" media/data-analysis-change-log-entries-data-changes-by-table-field.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Change Log Entries page (data changes by table/field)." lightbox="media/data-analysis-change-log-entries-data-changes-by-table-field.png":::

## About activity logs

From some pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view an activity log that shows the status and any errors from files that you export from or import into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Work with activity logs

The information is displayed on the **Activity Log** page according to the context you opened it from. For example, you can open the page from the **Document Exchange Service Setup**, **Incoming Document**, **Posted Sales Invoice**, and **Posted Sales Credit Memo** pages. You can empty the list of log entries, or just clear the list of entries older than seven days.  

## Monitor sensitive fields

Keeping sensitive data secure and private is a core concern for most businesses. To add a layer of security, you can monitor important fields and get an email when someone changes a value. For example, you might want to be notified if someone changes your company's IBAN number.

> [!NOTE]
> Sending notifications by email requires that you set up the email feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

### Set up field monitoring

You can use the **Monitor Field Change Setup** assisted setup guide to specify the fields that you want to monitor based on filter criteria, such as the data sensitivity classification for the fields. For more information, see [Classifying Data Sensitivity](admin-classifying-data-sensitivity.md). The guide also lets you specify the person who receives an email notification when a change occurs, and the email account that sends the notification. Specify both the user to notify and the account from which to send the notification. After you finish the guide, you can manage settings for field monitoring on the **Field Monitoring Setup** page.

> [!NOTE]
> When you specify the email account from which to send notifications, you must add either the **Microsoft 365** or **SMTP** account types. Notifications should be sent from an account that is not associated with an actual user. Therefore you cannot choose the **Current User** account type. If you do, notifications will not be sent.

Over time, the list of entries on the **Monitored Fields Log Entries** page will grow. To reduce the number of entries, you can create a retention policy that will delete entries after a specified period of time. For more information, see [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

When you set up field monitoring, or change something in the setup, entries are created for your changes. You can specify whether to display entries related to the monitoring setup by showing or hiding them.

You can manage settings for field monitoring, such as whether to send an email notification or just log the change, for each field on the **Monitored Fields Worksheet** page. The page is also where you can add or remove fields to monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add one or more fields and start monitoring, you must sign out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and sign in again to apply your settings.

### Work with field monitoring

Entries for all changed values for monitored fields are available on the **Monitored Fields Log Entries** page. For example, entries contain the following information:

- The field in which the value changed.
- The original and new values.
- Who made the change, and when they did so.

To further investigate a change, choose a value to open the page where it was made. To view a list of all entries, choose **Field Change Entries**.

### View field monitoring telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send field monitoring activity to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and IT Pro help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)
- [Analyzing Field Monitoring Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-field-monitoring-trace?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json)

## Define retention policies

You can create retention policies to delete unneeded data in logs after a period of time that you specify. For example, over time the number of entries in a log can build up. By cleaning up old entries you can make it easier to focus on more recent, and probably more relevant, entries. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

# Searching for Customers, Vendors, and Other Contacts from Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]. Introduced in 2021 release wave 1.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a comprehensive business contact management system that is essential for users in sales, operations, or other departmental roles. If you're a user in one of these roles, you'll often need to look up, meet, or start a conversation with your vendors, customers, and other contacts. With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can do these tasks directly from Teams, without having to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From within Teams, you can:

- Look up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts from the Teams command box or from the message compose area. Contacts can include prospects, vendors, customers, or other business relationships.
- Share a contact as a card in a Teams conversation.
- View details about the contact, interaction history, and other insights like outstanding payments or open documents.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)
- You've got a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account with access to contacts in at least one company.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you searching from the command box or message compose box, you may be asked to sign in or set up the app the first time. This step is necessary to search for contacts in the right Business Central company. Learn more about setting up the app to choose your company in [Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams](across-teams-settings.md).

## Look up contacts from the command box

The command box is at the top of every screen in Teams. It lets you search, take quick actions, or launch apps, like the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. Searching from the command box is great for quickly looking up contacts and their related data for your own use. For example, suppose you want to look up an email address of a vendor to set up a calendar meeting. Or maybe you want to look up interaction history during a meeting with a customer.

1. In the command box, type **/Business Central**, then select the Business Central app from the results.

    ![Open Business Central app  to search for contacts from command box.](media/teams-contacts-command-1b.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search Business Central contacts from command box in Teams.](media/teams-contacts-command-3.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears beneath the command box.

4. If you want to add the contact card into a conversation, go to the upper right corner of the card, select **... (More options)** > **Copy**. Then, paste the copy in the message compose box of a conversation.  

Learn more about the Teams command box at [Teams - Use the command box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-command-box-13c4e429-7324-4886-b377-5dbed539193b).

## Look up contacts from the message compose box

The advantage of using the message compose box is that you can add a contact card directly to a conversation, for others to see.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+** and then select **Business Central** from the list to launch the app.

    ![Open Business Central app to search for contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-message-box-2.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search for Business Central contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-6.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears in the message compose box.

> [!NOTE]
> The contact card isn't sent to the conversation right away for others to see. You have the opportunity to review the contents of the card, and add text before or after it as you like. Then, send your message to the chat when ready.

## Viewing contact card details

The contact card in Teams gives you a quick overview of the customer, vendor, or contact. The card is interactive&mdash;meaning you can view more information or even modify a contact by using the **Details** or **Pop-out** buttons.

The **Details** button opens a window within Teams that displays more information about the contact, but not as much as you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To see all the information about a contact in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Pop-out**.

The contact card works just like cards for records, like items, customers, or sales orders. Learn more in [View card details](across-working-with-teams.md#view-card-details).

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central contact that you submit to a conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

# Setting up purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, which is typically done once during the initial implementation. Learn more in the following section, [Purchases, and payables setup](#purchases-and-payables-setup).

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the finance setup section. Learn more at [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, such as units of measure and item tracking codes, can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).

## Purchases and payables setup

Before working with purchases and payables, specify on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page how purchase values are posted and the number series used for vendors and purchase documents.

### General settings

On the **General** FastTab, you specify options such as how you want to calculate and post discounts and whether you want to round invoices. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

Some fields require special attention, such as the **Calc. Inv. Disc. per VAT/Tax ID** field, which specifies whether the invoice discount is calculated according to the tax identifier or the invoice total. Learn more at [Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups](finance-setup-vat.md#combine-vat-posting-groups-in-vat-posting-setups).

Similarly, the **Appln. between Currencies** field can result in small rounding differences when applying entries in different currencies to one another. Learn more at [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).

Also, some fields change their behavior or depend on how other fields are set. For example, the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** feature is influenced by how the **Prepmt. Auto Update** field is set to check for pending prepayments.

Read details about the [**Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory**](#external-document-number) and [**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory**](#exact-cost-reversing) fields in sections later in this article.

### Number series settings

On the **Number Series** FastTab, you must specify unique identification codes to use for vendors, invoices, and other purchase documents. Numbering is important not only for internal processes, but might also need to follow local regulations. So it might be worth considering setting up all series in the **No. Series** page beforehand instead of creating new ones from the **Purchases & Payables Setup**. Learn more at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Exact cost reversing

The **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** function helps ensure returned goods are valued at the same cost as when they were originally drawn from inventory, using a fixed application instead of following an average or first-in, first-out (FIFO) costing method. Learn more in the [Design Details: Fixed Application](design-details-item-application.md#fixed-application) section. If an extra cost is later added to the original purchase, the program updates the value of the respective purchase return.

With the feature enabled, a return transaction can only be posted by specifying the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line. By default, the field isn't displayed on the **Lines** FastTab. To learn how to add fields to pages, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

# Setup Best Practices: Costing Method

The **Costing Method** on the item card defines item's cost flow is recorded and whether an actual or budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation.  

Setting the correct costing method according to item type and business environment is important to ensure economical inventories.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up the **Costing Method** field. For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|FIFO|Use where the product cost is stable.<br /><br /> Use for items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date.|An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> In inventory valuation, it is assumed that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. **Note:**  When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.|

This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates. **Important:**  Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.|  
|Average|Use where the product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> Use where inventories are piled or mixed together and cannot be differentiated, such as chemicals.|An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> For inventory valuation, it is assumed that all inventories are sold simultaneously.|
|Specific|Use in production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> Use for items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> Use for items with serial numbers.|An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received.|
|Standard|Use where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> Use in repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Use where there is discipline and staff to maintain standards.|An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values.|

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

# Inventory by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory by Location** outlines inventory levels across an organization's locations. It provides an accurate picture of each location and the inventory levels broken down by category and item.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is designed for management teams in warehousing and supply chain management.

Warehouse managers can use the report to check whether each location has appropriate stock levels. This information can help identify whether a location is low or high on stock, and show where you can move stock around where required.

For supply chain managers, the report provides information about where you store each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions about shipping and ensure that items are delivered on time and at the lowest cost.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Location* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

title: Track item cost adjustments
description: Learn how tracking adjustments to item costs can help you keep your item cost data accurate.

# Track item cost adjustments

It's important to keep item costs accurate and shorten the time between when you post an entry and when the general ledger reflects its cost. You can track the performance of the cost adjustments for individual adjustment runs and items. If errors happen, you can identify the problematic items and make corrections. For example, you can exclude the items from calculations to ensure adjustments aren't interrupted for other items. You can adjust costs for individual items or create batches of items and adjust them all at the same time.

## Start tracking cost adjustments

It's easy to get started. On the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Cost Adjustment Logging** field offers a few options:

* **Disabled** means you don't log cost adjustment runs.
* **Errors Only** means you log only runs that failed.
* **All** means you log all runs.

> [!NOTE]
> To minimize the size of the log, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't log the adjustments that happen automatically when someone posts an item.

You must also set up the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. This job queue entry automatically adjusts costs according to a schedule. To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Manage cost adjustments

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process.

### About item batches

You can run cost adjustments for several items by grouping them into batches. Batches make it easy to adjust some items separately, for example, because they take longer to adjust. Batches can also help identify items that have issues.

To create a batch, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page:

* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add Batch**.

To create a batch and run cost adjustment immediately:
* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add batch and run**.
* Choose **Run cost adjustment**, choose **Item Batches**, and then enter a filter in the **Item Filter** field.
  
> [!TIP]
> To quickly create another batch for all items that aren't already included in a batch, on the **Cost Adjustment - Item Batches** page, choose **Add Missing Items**.

When a run for a batch finishes, the batch has one of the following status on the **Item Batches** page:

* **Success**: The cost adjustment is successful.
* **Failed**: If the cost adjustment fails, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies the item that caused the error and then splits the current batch into two. One batch with the problematic item, and another with the remaining items. Cost adjustment reruns for the batch with the remaining items. If it fails again, the process repeats. You define the maximum number of splits in the **Max. Retry Attempts** field. The default value for retries is 10, but you can enter a new limit.
* **Timed out**: If the cost adjustment for a batch doesn't finish within the period specified in the **Timeout (Minutes)** field (ranging from 1 to 720 minutes), the session terminates and changes are rolled back. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then splits the current batch in half and reruns the cost adjustment process for each half. This process continues until the cost adjustment is successful or reaches the maximum retry attempts.

> [TIP!]
> Each batch runs in a separate session. To monitor progress, use the **Refresh** action.

### Run cost adjustment

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to make adjustments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Cost Adjustment**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on what you want to do, use one of the following options:

  * For one or more items immediately, select the items in the list and then choose **Run cost adjustment**.
  * For batches, use one of the following options:

    * To create a batch and adjust costs immediately, choose the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then **Add batch and run**.
    * To run it for all batches, choose **Run cost adjustment**, **Item Batches**, and then choose **Run**. To learn more about batches, go to [About item batches](#about-item-batches).
  * For all items on an item-by-item basis, which saves the results after each item is processed. For example, this option is useful for handling a large number of items, reducing lock times, and preventing full reruns if something goes wrong. To use this option, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** report, and turn on the **Item-by-Item Adjustment** toggle.

### Explore item details

Use the **Item** menu to access information about cost adjustments for a selected item.

* **Item Ledger Entries**: List item entries for the item. The **Mark for Adjustment** action lets you force the rerun of cost adjustment for items directly or indirectly linked to the inbound entries you select. Forcing a rerun can be helpful if previous runs led to incorrect costs.
* **Value Entries**: List value entries for the item.
* **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points**: Open the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** page, which you primarily use to calculate average cost. The page displays combinations of items, locations, variants, and valuation dates for which cost adjustments are, or must be, run.
* **Cost Adjmt. Orders**: Open the **Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)** page, where you adjust production and assembly orders. It shows the orders are adjusted or require adjustment.
* **Item Application Entries**: Open the **Item Application Entries** page for details about quantity and cost applications. You can use the **Reset Outbound Entry is Updated** action in combination with the **Mark for Adjustment** setting on the **Item Ledger Entries** page to force a rerun of cost adjustment.

### View the outcome

Use the **Log per** menu to view the outcome of cost adjustments:

* **Run**: Show cost adjustment logs for each run. The log includes data about the item filter, status (Success/Failed/Timed out), start and end date/time, duration, and the cost differences produced by the run.
* **Item**: Show detailed information about the adjustment process for the selected item.

### Include or exclude items from adjustments

If one or more items fail, you can exclude the items from the adjustment run and then include them in later runs. On the **Functions** menu, choose one of the following:

* **Exclude item from adjustment** and **Include item in adjustment**: Temporarily disable and then re-enable cost adjustment for a selected item. Cost adjustment continues to keep costs accurate for other items while you investigate an issue with a specific item.

### Use iterative cost adjustments

To manage the processing scope of cost adjustments for items that have a high volume of transactions, you can do the adjustments on a period-by-period basis. You can do that in just a few steps. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select the item to adjust, choose the **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points** action. Next, choose the **Valuation Date** until you want to complete the adjustment and then choose the **Adjust Cost Until Valuation Date** action.

These steps adjust entries for the selected item up to the chosen date and affects entries across all locations and variants. The item is marked as adjusted when all periods are fully adjusted.

You can also adjust costs for individual production and assembly orders. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select one or more production or assembly orders, and then choose the **Adjust Cost for Selected Orders** action.

## Post adjusted costs to the general ledger

Typically, new value entries are posted to the general ledger according to the schedule for the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. However, you can post adjustments to the general ledger immediately from the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page. On the **Functions** menu, choose **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

## Troubleshoot cost adjustments

Use the following options on the **Diagnostics** menu to troubleshoot cost adjustment runs.

* **Export item data**: Export item-related data to a text file. You can use the file for further analysis in a sandbox environment or attach it to a support request when investigating costing calculation issues.
* **Import item data**: Import the previously exported text file back into the database. This action is only enabled in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.
* **Reset Cost Is Adjusted**: Reset the **Cost Is Adjusted** toggle on items, production orders, or assembly orders. This setting allows you to force the rerun of the cost adjustment for them.
* **Costing Issues Detection report**: Diagnose typical data issues cause calculation errors in costing. It checks whether the item ledger entries, value entries, item application entries, and capacity ledger entries are correct.
* **Delete item data**: Clear all item-related tables in the database. This action is only available in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.

### Self-diagnostics for potential issues and performance pitfalls

During posting and cost adjustment, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] scans the current setup and data to identify inefficiencies that might affect the accuracy and performance of cost adjustment.

When you open the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, a notification might state that issues were found. You can view the issues on the **Action Messages** page by selecting **Action Messages** in the **Diagnostics** section.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] issues warnings in the following scenarios:

* Cost adjustment isn't set for automatic runs or run manually.
* Average cost adjustment settings aren't optimal for performance.
* Inventory periods aren't in use.
* Many periods require adjustment.
* Many production and assembly orders require adjustment.
* Cost adjustment for a single item takes more than five minutes to complete.
* One or more items are excluded from cost adjustment.
* Data discrepancies remain after cost adjustment completes.

Scanning happens automatically during normal system usage, but you can start it manually at any time by selecting the **Run Tests** action on the **Cost Adjmt. Action Messages** page. You can't turn off diagnostics completely but you can pause it for up to 30 days by choosing **Snooze for 30 days**.

## Use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature

Cost adjustment can take time to complete. For example, due to a high volume of entries, data errors, or a setup that isn't optimal. Because the cause is often unclear, you can use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature to gain visibility and get some help to diagnose data-related issues.

To use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, choose **Item Batches**. Create a batch for one or more items, fill in the **Timeout (minutes)** field, select the **Trace** checkbox, and then choose the **Run** action.

During the cost adjustment process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records AL events, items, locations, variants, entries, and orders it processes. When the cost adjustment completes or reaches the specified time-out, it saves the results in the **Trace Log**. To access the recorded details, select **Trace Log**. Due to the potentially large volume of log entries, we recommend that you turn on the **Analysis View** mode to summarize the data.

# Design Details: Planning Assignment Table
All items should be planned for, however, there is no reason to calculate a plan for an item unless there has been a change in the demand or supply pattern since the last time a plan was calculated.  

If the user has entered a new sales order or changed an existing one, there is reason to recalculate the plan. Other reasons include a change in forecast or the desired safety stock quantity. Changing a bill of material by adding or removing a component would most likely indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

For multiple locations, the assignment takes place at the level of item per location combination. If, for example, a sales order has been created at only one location, application will assign the item at that specific location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If no change in an item’s demand-supply pattern has occurred, the planning system will not suggest any actions to be taken. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items in order to find out what to plan for, and that would drain system resources.  

The **Planning Assignment** table monitors demand and supply events and assigns the appropriate items for planning. The following events are monitored:  

* A new sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Change of item, quantity, location, variant, or date on a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Cancellation of a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Consumption of items other than planned.  
* Output of items other than planned.  
* Unplanned changes in inventory.  

For these direct supply-demand displacements, the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message.  

The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance:  

* Change of status to Certified in the production BOM header (for all items using that header).  
* Deleted line (child item).  
* Change of status to Certified in the routing header (for all items using that routing).  
* Changes in the following item card fields.  
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time.  
* Lead Time Calculation.  
* Reorder Point.  
* Production BOM No. (and all children of old BOM reference).  
* Routing No.  
* Reordering Policy.  

In these cases, a new function, Planning Assignment Management, maintains the table and states the planning reason as Net Change.  

The following changes do not cause a planning assignment:  

* Calendars  
* Other planning parameters on the item card  

When calculating an MPS or an MRP, the following restrictions apply:  

* MPS: The planning system checks that the item carries a demand forecast or a sales order. If not, the item is not included in the plan.  
* MRP: If the planning system detects that the item is being replenished by an MPS planning line or MPS supply order, the item will be left out of the planning. However, any demand from relevant components is included.

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

# Business Process Walkthroughs

This selection of walkthroughs provides step-by-step, end-to-end business processes that you can perform using the CRONUS demonstration company. The walkthroughs consist of multiple procedures, some of which would normally be performed by one user, while others incorporate several different user roles. In order to simulate the working environment, some of the walkthroughs contain setup steps necessary to complete the exercises as described. These steps can provide insight into the kind of information users need to share with their company's IT professionals.  

 The walkthroughs are complete scenarios, and should be performed from beginning to end for the greatest benefit. Many are based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstrations, and enable you to try those procedures yourself, at your own pace.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the walkthroughs require sample data that is not available in the default demonstration company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. <!--For more information, see [Sandbox Environments](admin-sandbox-environments.md). -->

# Responsible AI FAQ for Autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central and expert users who are tasked with entering records throughout their workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central as if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the **like** (thumbs up) or **dislike** (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- **General AI limitations**
  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. 

- **Geographic and language availability**

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- **Certain industry, product, and subject limitations**

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot due to the sensitive nature of that domain.

## What data does Autofill collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to offer the service. 

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your choice to keep or discard a suggestion. It doesn't collect suggested field values or other company data used by Copilot to provide suggestions.
- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Development of Validated Localization apps

This article describes the requirements and guidelines for developing a Validated Localization app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is a Validated Localization app?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available [globally in 170+ markets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json). In some markets, Microsoft works with independent software vendor (ISV) partners to localize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through localization apps that we make available on [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For those regions, localizations can be available through preferred localization app program. Preferred localization apps program recognizes those apps, which are built according to Microsoft quality guidelines. ISV partners who comply with those program requirements and guidelines can benefit technically and commercially to serve their resellers and customers.  

In the following sections, you can find requirements and guidelines. You can reach out to the program team if you want to participate in this program and comply with the below requirements by contacting us through [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Validated Localization apps initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot program. The following requirements and benefits can change based upon the partner and customer feedback.  

Apps in the Validated Localization pilot program contain a set of functionalities addressing local regulatory requirements that fall within one of the categories in the following list.  

- **Regulatory requirements** - local functionality that helps businesses fulfill their legal requirements, such as tax reporting, local E-invoicing formats, local GAAP, and other regulatory requirements.
- **National standards requirement** – local functionality that addresses local standards, such as address formats, national banking formats, or local interpretations of global standards.
- **Local language** - local language in the localization app, but also for a base app if this language isn't currently on the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Local market needs or industry requirements should not be included in the preferred localization apps. If apps contain these functionalities, the apps can't be approved as Validated Localization apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Local functionality is beneficial to the productivity business processes in a country and thereby adds value to a business but isn't required from a regulatory perspective, such as specific banking and payment formats, expense reports, HR features, and payroll. Similar smaller or bigger, and nice-to-have features should be isolated into other apps. If apps contain these functionalities, they aren't approved as Validated Localization apps.

## Validated Localization app business requirements  

- The Validated Localization App provider complies with all requirements to be a CSP indirect provider.  
- The Validated Localization App provider brings to market a minimum of offerings across five countries/regions, which bundle Dynamics 365 Business Central with a Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider has a minimum of 10 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers with production environments, which are actively using the Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider submits a business plan on a yearly basis to the program v-team. The plan includes planned marketing and readiness activities to promote the bundled offering with the CSP Indirect Resellers in applicable countries/regions. Plan can be submitted at the start of each quarter to [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).  
- The Validated Localization Apps are available to all customers and partners who want to benefit from them.
- The Validated Localization App provider engages in recurring workstreams with Microsoft.
- The Validated Localization App provider must maintain its status as an Embedded Localization Partner.  
- The Validated Localization App provider agrees to continuously adhere to the business, functional, and technical requirements outlined on this page.

## Validated Localization app functional and technical requirements  

### Functionality requirements

In addition to the technical requirements for the preferred localization app, the minimum viable product scope for preferred localization app is:  

- Local Regulatory Features:  
  - Legal requirements.
  - Officially mandatory features.
  - Horizontal only features (not industry-specific).  
  - Applicable in most businesses.  
  - Within the following blueprint:
    - Areas of the most frequent legislative changes.
    - Already tracked as a localization in Microsoft localizations.
    - Feature references – seldom new.  
    - No vendor or bank specific formats, payroll, or similar.
    - No global features not built by Microsoft.
- Translations:
  - Translation of a localization app to local languages.
  - Translation of a base app to local languages if the language isn't already [supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  
  - Translation of the localization app's documentation to local languages.
- Even though they're both part of localization, we recommended that National Standard Features (local part) are built as separate apps from Local Regulatory Features.
- Demo data in the local language for the specific market.
- All features must be designed with a basic user interface. They're intended primarily for the SMB market.  
- Avoid building new features if the same or similar functionality is already in the base app. For example, electronic invoicing, audit exports, VAT features, data exchange, and others. Most of the functionality is common to all countries/regions, but there are local rules or business formats that are extensions of global frameworks or formats. Instead of building new features, extend existing ones.  
- Prepare setup guides (wizards) for areas that are complex to set up to help users enable, discover, and have good first experience using your localization app.  
- Partners must provide functional documentation for all aspects of their localization.  

### Technical requirements  

The following are requirements that you must meet before submitting the Validated Localization app as an extension for validation. This list doesn’t change the [technical validation list](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission) and only extends requirements from there.  

- Providers must build the Validated Localization app based on the W1 base app.  
- Providers must follow Microsoft lifecycle and support policies.   
- Mandatory test automation must cover a minimum 80% of code and all business processes that change with the Validated Localization app must be covered by test automation.  
- Providers must update and/or test its Validated Localization app before the official launch of new release (minimum with the RC before new release) to confirm there are no issues. 
- All objects in the Validated Localization app code must be in English.   
- The Validated Localization app providers must follow Microsoft policy for obsolete objects and breaking changes and best practices for deprecation of the AL Code.  
- The Validated Localization app providers should add new events if required by the market (other implementation partners or customers) if it makes reasonable business sense. The events must follow Microsoft policy and practice. Otherwise, the validated localization app providers must provide a response to justify why it doesn't make reasonable business sense to add them.
- The Validated Localization app providers must provide written test scenarios in English and enable Microsoft to do manual testing if required by Microsoft.  
- If a Validated Localization app extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data model with new tables and/or fields, the Validated Localization app provider must set the **DataClassification** property correctly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create an integration if you find it beneficial to have some functionality placed outside the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and instead connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using for example, APIs or web services.

> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). To learn more, go to [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).  

Choose an app to learn about what it does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to its terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. Some apps require that you provide some information before you can use them. For example, after you install the **PayPal Payments Standard** app, you must specify the email or the Merchant account ID for your PayPal account. To set up an app, or to find out what information you need, on the **Installed Extensions** page, choose the **Set up** action.  

Other apps simply add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. The data is available if you install the app again.

Some apps are provided by Microsoft, and other apps are provided by [other companies](ui-extensions-other.md). We recommend that you learn more about the app before you choose to install it.

Microsoft provides the following apps:

## Set up an app

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. For example, for the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app you must specify the PayPal account to use. If that's the case, when installation completes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks whether you want to set up the app right away. Setups can be required for the app to work, or optional.

If you choose to set up your app right away, and it has a required setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the required setup. The setup can be either a page where you enter information, or an assisted setup guide that helps you through the steps. If you don't complete the setup in one go, you can use the **Setups for _name of app_** page, which lists all setups for the app. Required setups indicated by **bold letters**.

## Upload a per-tenant extension (PTE)

You upload a PTE by using the **Extension Management** page. On the **Extension Management** page, go to **Manage**, then choose **Upload Extension**. On the **Upload and Deploy Extension** page, specify the .app file to upload. To proceed, choose the **Accept** button, and then the **Deploy** action to  start deploying the PTE.

If the PTE contains breaking schema changes, it's possible to *force* an upload of it. To do that, in **Schema Sync Mode** choose the **Force** option, and then confirm that you want to proceed. 

## Uninstall an app

You uninstall an app by using the **Extension Management** page. To uninstall an app, select it on the page, then select the **Uninstall** action. If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install the app again.

By default, when you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. If you're sure you won't reinstall the app, you can delete the data when you uninstall it. To delete data when you uninstall an app, turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle and then confirm your action. Afterward, you can uninstall the app. Reconfirm that you want to uninstall the app and delete the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> * There might be apps that require or depend on the app that you want to uninstall. These apps are referred to as *dependents*. You can't uninstall an app unless you also uninstall its dependents. When you uninstall an app that has dependents, a dialog lists the dependents. To continue, select **Yes** to uninstall the app and its dependents.
> * If you turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle, uninstalling the app deletes all data for the app *plus* data for all dependent apps. The action can't be undone.
> * Some apps are required and you can't delete them on the **Extension Management** page.  

If you want to keep the data for an uninstalled app, you can delete the data later. The **Delete Orphaned Extension Data** page lists the apps that you still have data for. To delete the data, choose the app, and then choose **Delete Data**.

# Set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service

You can import electronic bank statements from your bank to quickly fill on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page so you can apply payments and reconcile the bank account. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. This functionality is not supported for on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments hosted on Embed ISV application services. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a co-brand account from Envestnet, and you must add code to integrate with the Yodlee API.
>
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For technical assistance with the Envestnet Yodlee functionality, contact Microsoft Support. Do not contact Envestnet Yodlee. For more information, see [Configuring Technical Support for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support).

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is installed as an extension to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and is ready to be enabled in the supported countries/regions. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

After you enable the bank feed service, you must link a bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

* A bank account doesn't exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
* A bank account exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which you want to link to an online bank account.
* A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
* Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When the bank feed service is enabled, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statements into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page every two hours. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page won't be imported. For more information, see the “To enable automatic import of bank statements” section.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the Set Up Company assisted setup guide, some of the steps in the following procedures happen automatically when you get to the company bank account setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## To enable the bank feed service

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the bank account that you'll use for the bank feed service.
3. On the **Bank Account Card** page, in the **Bank Statement Import Format** field, select YODLEEBANKFEED.  

The bank feed service is enabled when you link a bank account to its related online bank account. See the next procedure.

    > If you have more than one online bank account at the bank, you must create additional bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for them. See steps 8 through 10.  

    After the process completes, the bank name will appear in the **My Accounts** pane on the **Linked** tab. The number in brackets indicates how many online bank accounts were linked.  
7. Choose the **OK** button.

    If you're only linking one online bank account, the **Bank Account Card** page opens and displays the name of the online bank account. In this case, the bank account linking task is completed.

    If you're linking more than one online bank accounts, the **Bank Account Linking** page opens and lists the online bank accounts that aren't yet linked to bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In that case, follow the next step.  
8. On the **Bank Account Linking** page, select the line for an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to New Bank Account** action.  

    The **Bank Account Card** page for a new bank account opens and displays the name of the online bank account.

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. To learn more, go to [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. To learn more, go to [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).
   * The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. To learn more, go to [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. To learn more, go to [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. To learn more, go to [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. To learn more, go to [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

## To fill and post a cash receipt journal

A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal. You can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment. You can also apply from the posted entries later.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.

7. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.
8. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer.

On the ledger entry list, on the line that contains the ledger entry that was fully applied to, notice that the **Open** checkbox isn't selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
> After you select an entry on the **Apply Customer Entries** page, or several entries by setting the **Applies-to ID**, the **Applied Amount** field on the journal line contains the sum of the remaining amounts for the posted entries you selected, unless the field contains something already. If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. To learn more, go to [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there might be a small residual amount when they convert to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries

When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If an entry was applied by more than one application entry, unapply the latest application entry first.

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## To create an opportunity from a salesperson
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the salesperson from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose **List**.
4. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields as relevant. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  



## To create an opportunity from a contact
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Do one of the following:
   * Choose the **Create Opportunity** action.
   * Choose the  **Opportunities** action, and then choose **New**.
4. Fill in the relevant fields.

# Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Stock**, the sales order process assumes that the item is already assembled and can be picked from inventory if it's available. Therefore, an assembly order isn't automatically created and linked to the sales order line. However, if some or all of the quantity isn't available, you can create an assembly order for the remaining quantity. To do that, fill in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line. This setting lets you assemble the item to order although it's set up to be assembled to stock.  

You have similar flexibility when you sell assemble-to-order items and some of the quantity is already in inventory. You'll want to deduct that quantity from the assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure doesn't include the sales order steps that you need to follow before you create an assembly order for unavailable quantities.

## To sell assemble-to-order items and inventory items together

1. On a sales order line for an assemble-to-stock item, enter a quantity in the **Quantity** field that exceeds inventory. The **Check Availability** page appears. To learn more about item availability, go to [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).
2. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the value from the **Total Quantity** field.  
3. Make any changes needed to the assembly components. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  
4. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about the standard assembly steps, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it is, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Let Business Central suggest values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you complete tasks faster and more accurately by prefilling fields or completing lines with data that you would otherwise calculate and enter manually. Although such automatic data entry is always correct, you can change it afterwards if you want to.

This article contains a selection of such functionality. More sections will be added in future updates of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When you draft a new record or edit an existing record, Copilot suggests values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## The **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page

When, for example, you're entering general journal lines for multiple expenses that must all be posted to the same bank account, then each time you enter a new journal line for an expense, you can have the **Amount** field on the bank account line automatically updated to the amount that balances the expenses. For more information about working with general journals, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

### To have the **Amount** field on balancing general journal lines filled automatically

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the line for your preferred general journal batch, choose the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box.
1. Open the general journal and proceed to register and post transactions using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.       

For information about how to set up a personal general journal batch, for example, for expense handling, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

## The **Automatically Fill Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page

The **Register Customer Payments** page shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment. For more information about applying customer payments, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

Your main actions on the page are to fill in the **Payment Made** check box and the **Date Received** field. You can set [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] up to automatically enter work date in the **Date Received** field when you select the **Payment Made** check box.

### To have the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page filled automatically

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the **Automatically Fill Date Received** check box.
1. Open the **Register Customer Payments** page and proceed to process incoming customer payments using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.

# Personalize your workspace

You can personalize your workspace to suit your work and preferences. Change pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. Personalization affects only your workspace. It doesn't change how others work. You can personalize all types of pages, including the [role center](ui-change-basic-settings.md#role-center) page.

The adjustments outlined in this article are applied universally across all your devices and browsers. There are other modifications, not detailed here, that only affect the specific device and browser on which they're made. Learn more about the differences in [Where is personalization stored?](ui-personalization-stored.md).

## Video and training

The following video shows some of the ways in which you can personalize your Role Center.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=d76e5d60-ecc2-462b-bba2-18d6deee3534]

For online training, go to [Personalize the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central user interface](/training/modules/personalize-ui-dynamics-365-business-central/).

## About personalization

You can make various adjustments, such as move or hide fields, columns, actions, and entire parts, and add new fields. You do most adjustments by first activating the **Personalizing** banner using the [personalization mode](#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode). You can also readily make the following adjustments on any list page without using the personalization mode:

- [Resize a column](#resize-a-column)
- [Create, rename, or edit a view](ui-views.md)
- [Bookmark the page](ui-bookmarks.md)
- [Hide or resize a FactBox](#hide-or-resize-a-factbox)
- Expand/collapse hierarchical list

### Resize a column

There are two ways to change the width of a column in any list, including in dropdown lists for looking up field values:

- Select and drag the boundary between two columns in the header of a list.
- Double-click the boundary between two columns to autofit the width of the column. The width adjusts to the optimal size for readability.

### Hide or resize a FactBox

A FactBox is a pane along the right side of a page that displays more information related to the record on the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/factbox.png" alt-text="Shows the FactBox position in the web client":::

- To hide or show the FactBox, select the ![Shows the collapse or expand FactBox icon in Business Central](media/collapse-expand-factbox.png) **Collapse/Expand the FactBox pane** icon at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To resize the FactBox, drag the vertical divider between the FactBox and main content. Double-click the divider to reset the width to default.

   If you can't resize the FactBox, you're either using Business Central version earlier than 26.0, or **Feature: Optimize screen estate usage for web** isn't turned on in **Feature Management**. Contact your admin, or learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

## Start personalizing by using the personalization mode

1. Open any page that you want to personalize.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") and then choose the **Personalize** action.

    The **Personalizing** banner appears at the top to indicate that you can start making changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

    If you see **Personalize lock** ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") or **Personalization blocked** ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") on the banner, you can't personalize the page. For more information, see [Why a Page is Locked from Personalization](ui-personalization-locked.md).

1. To change a user interface (UI) element, point to the element, such as an action, a field, or a part. The element is immediately highlighted with an arrowhead or border. Choose the element, and then choose either **Move**, **Remove**, **Hide**, **Show**, **Show under "Show more"**, **Show when collapsed**, **Show always**, **Set/Clear Freeze Pane**, or **Include/Exclude from Quick Entry**, depending on the type and state of the UI element.
1. To add a field, choose the **+ Field** action. From the **Add Field to Page** pane, drag and drop a field into the desired position on the page.
1. When you finish changing the layout of one or more pages, choose **Done** on the **Personalizing** banner.

## <a name="Actions"></a>Personalize action bar and menus

Personalization lets you decide which actions to show on the navigation and action bars and on Role Centers, and where to show them. You can show, hide, or move individual actions or action groups.

The following video shows how you can personalize actions on pages and Role Centers.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=88d1055a-6b3d-4767-bbf7-98a78170e394]

Personalizing the navigation and action bars is done basically the same as with other UI elements. However, what you can do with an action or group depends on where the action or group is located. The best way to find out is to enter personalizing mode and then let the arrowheads guide you.

There are a couple of terms that you should be familiar with to better understand action personalization: *action group* and *promoted category*.  

An *action group* is an element that expands to display other actions or groups. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, one action group is the **Functions** action that appears when you choose the **Actions** action.

A *promoted category* is an action group that appears before the vertical line `|` on the action bar. The categories typically include the most commonly used actions, so that you can quickly find them. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, the **Order**, **Release**, and **Posting** actions are promoted categories.

> [!NOTE]  
> To clear personalization, select the arrowhead around the part's designer menu, and then choose **Clear personalization**.

### Remove, hide, and show actions and action groups

When you want to show or hide an action, the options under the arrowhead define what you can do depending on the action's state. 

1. Choose the arrowhead for an action or action group.
2. Choose from one of the following options:

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Remove**|This option appears if the selected action is also shown somewhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Choosing this option deletes the action from the selected location so that it no longer appears. The action or action group remains in the other locations. |
   |**Hide**|This option appears if the action or action group isn't located anywhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Like **Remove**, choosing this option makes the action or action group disappear from the navigation bar or action bar. However, in personalizing mode, the action, or action group is still shown in the current position, except that it appears dimmed.|
   |**Show**|This option appears if the action or action group is hidden (dimmed). Choosing this option makes the action or action group appear on the navigation bar or action bar.|

### Move actions and action groups

A horizontal line between two actions or a border around an action group indicates where you can drop actions or actions groups. There are the following limitations:

- You can move individual actions into the promoted categories, but you can't rearrange the order of the actions in the category.
- You can't move an action group into a promoted category.

To move an action or action group, drag and drop it into the desired position, like you do with fields and columns.

To move an action or action group into another action group that is empty, drag the action or action group to the new group and drop it in the **Drop an action here** box.

### About the Automate menu

- You can't hide or move the **Automate** menu or the **Power Automate** submenu and its actions.
- You can move flows included under the **Automate** item, but you can't hide them using personalization. Moving the flow makes a copy the flow in the destination, it doesn't remove it from the **Automate** item.

> [!TIP]
> As an administrator, you can hide the **Automation** item from users. Learn more at [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

## <a name="Parts"></a>Personalize parts

Hover over or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to get information about a field.

Parts are areas on a page that are typically composed of multiple fields, charts, or other content. A part shows a colored border when you focus on the part. For example, a Role Center home screen has multiple parts. Because of their well-defined boundary, you can personalize the entire part and its contents.

- To move a part, drag and drop it into the desired position. A colored line indicates valid positions on the screen. For example, FactBoxes can only be moved next to other FactBoxes in the FactBox pane.
- You can hide a part by choosing the **Hide** option under the arrowhead.
- When you start personalizing or navigate to a new page, any parts that are currently hidden appear on the page with distinctive visuals to indicate they're hidden. You can unhide that part by choosing the **Show** option under the arrowhead.

You can clear all personalization changes that you made within a single part by choosing the **Clear personalization** option under the part's arrowhead. Clearing personalization of a part only affects changes to the contents of the part. It doesn't affect the placement or visibility of the part on the page.  

## <a name="fields"></a> Work with fields and columns

When personalizing a page, you use the **Add field to page** pane to include fields or columns on the page that are currently hidden from view. To open this pane, select the **+ Field** action near the top of the page. Unlike other hidden elements, hidden fields aren't indicated on the page itself in personalization mode. However, you can identify hidden fields by using the **Add field to page** pane.

Here are some general guidelines to follow when using the **Add field to page** pane:

- By default, the pane lists all hidden fields. To find hidden fields, look for the ![Shows the hidden field icon](media/hidden-icon.png "Shows the hidden field icon") icon.
- You can filter the list to show other fields, for example, those fields currently shown on the page, by selecting the **Recommended fields** button above the list and choosing a filter option. The name of the button changes based on the filter option you choose.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/personlaization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the personalization mode.":::
- Selecting a field in the list highlights its location on the page. If the field is hidden, its location shows in a shaded state.
- To get more details about a field in the list, hover over it or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to display a tooltip.
- The fields available in the **Add field to page** pane are determined by the developer of the page and its source table or by a profile admin who [customized the page](ui-personalization-manage.md). You can't create new ones.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.

### Add a field so it's visible on the page

From the **Add field to page** pane, there are two ways to include a hidden field on the page:

- Drag the field to the desired position. A thick horizontal or vertical line indicates the target location.
- Select the field in the list, then go to the shaded field on the page and select the **Show** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Some fields that you add won't be editable on the page when you're done with personalization. These fields are either originally designed this way or an administrator [customized](ui-personalization-manage.md) the page to prevent you from editing them.

## Clear personalization

At some point, you might want to undo some or all of the personalization changes that you made to a page over time.

1. On the **Personalizing** banner, choose the **Clear personalization** action.
2. Choose one of the following options.  

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Clearing personalization can't be undone.

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Only Navigation Menu**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the navigation menu that is shared across the Role Center and other pages. Such changes include any new actions that were added as bookmarks, and any changes to links and groups in the menu.|  
   |**Only Actions**|Clears any personalization changes that you made on the navigation or action bars on the page.|
   |**Only Fields and Columns**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the page except changes on the navigation or action bars. Such changes include changes to fields, columns, parts, and tiles. |
   |**All**|Clears all personalization changes that you made to the page so it looks like it did originally. Such changes include changes to navigation and action bars, fields, columns, parts, and tiles.|

## Tips and other points of interest

To help you better understand personalization, here are some pointers:

- When you make changes to a card page that you open from a list, the changes take effect on all records that you open from that list. For example, let's say you open a specific customer from the Customers list page, and then personalize the page by adding a field. When you open other customers from the list, the field that you added is also shown.
- Changes that you make affect all your Role Centers. For example, if you make a change to the Customer list when the Role Center is set to Business Manager, you also see the change on the **Customers** page when the Role Center is set to Sales Order Processor.
- Changes to a page in a pane take effect on the page wherever it appears.  
- You can't personalize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you happen to switch to personalization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analysis mode is automatically switched off.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.
- If a part or group is hidden, ghosted fields still show inside it, but you can't drag-and-drop or add/show that field until you make the group/part visible.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to restrictions on design capabilities in the web client, it's currently not possible to customize or personalize the controls within the `grid` and `fixed` syntax. It applies to all design modes, not just personalization.
>
> Administrators can make the same layout changes as users by customizing a profile (role), which can be assigned to multiple users. To learn more about pages for Roles, go to [Customize Pages for Roles](ui-personalization-manage.md)<br /><br />
Administrators can also override or disable users' personalization, and they can define which features are even available for users to see in all or specific companies. For more information, see [Customize Business Central](ui-customizing-overview.md).

# Insure fixed assets

Use the **Insurance Card** page to set up an insurance policy to cover one or more fixed assets. You can assign one fixed asset to one insurance policy, or multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy.

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger from the **Insurance Journal** page.

In addition, you can assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy and create coverage ledger entries when you post its acquisition cost. You post an acquisition cost from the fixed asset journal with the **Insurance No.** field filled in. You must turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. For more information, see [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](fa-how-acquire.md#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page isn't turned on, posting acquisitions from the fixed asset journal creates lines on the **Insurance Journal** page. You must post those lines manually.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you don't turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, your insurance journal should be based on a journal template without a number series. This is because the inserted document numbers from the fixed asset journal line will otherwise conflict with the number series of the insurance journal. For more information about journal templates and batches, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).

After you assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, the **Insured** field on the fixed asset card contains **Yes**. When you sell the fixed asset, the toggle is automatically turned off.

## To create or modify an insurance card

When you receive information about changes in the coverage amount, you must enter the new information on the **Insurance Card** page to ensure that you analyze insurance policy coverage correctly.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card for an insurance policy. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Alternatively, select the insurance policy that you want to change, and then choose the **Edit** action.

## To assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting from the insurance journal

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger.  

The following procedure explains how to create an insurance journal line manually. If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle is turned on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, insurance journal lines are automatically created when you post acquisition costs. In that case, all you have to do is to post the journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant journal, and fill in the journal lines as necessary.  
3. To assign multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy, create journal lines with the same value in the **Insurance No.** field and different values in the **FA No.** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The entries from an insurance journal are only posted to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To update the insurance value of a fixed asset

You can use the **Index Insurance** batch job to update the value of the fixed assets that are covered.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   In the **Index Figure** field, you enter a decrease of 5%, for example, as 95, whereas you enter an increase of 2% as 102.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

   The batch job calculates the new amount as a percentage of the total value insured, as stated on the **Insurance Statistics** page, and then creates a line in the insurance journal.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Open the relevant insurance journal, review the created values, and then post them to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To monitor insurance coverage

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing insurance policies and whether your fixed assets are over- or under-insured.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed assets insurance, go to [Fixed assets insurance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-insurance-reports).

### Overview of insurance policies

To get an overview of your insurance policies, use the [Insurance - List](reports/report-5621.md) report.

### Insurance coverage

To find out which insurance policies cover each asset, and by which amount, use the [Insurance - Tot. Value Insured](reports/report-5625.md) report.

#### Over/under coverage

You can check whether fixed assets are over- or under-insured in the following ways:  

* The **Insurance Statistics** page. A positive amount in the **Over/Under Insured** field means that the fixed asset is over-insured. A negative amount means that the asset is under-insured.  
* The **Fixed Asset Statistics** page. Choose the **Total Value Insured** field to view the **Ins. Coverage Ledger Entries** page.  
* The **Over/Under Coverage** report.  
* The [Insurance - Analysis](reports/report-5620.md) report.  


### Uninsured fixed assets

To check whether you forgot to assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, use the [Insurance - Uninsured FAs](reports/report-5626.md) report. 


## To view insurance coverage ledger entries

You can view the entries that you made in the insurance coverage ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Coverage Ledger Entries** action.  


## To view the total insurance value of fixed assets

A matrix page shows the insurance values that are registered for each insurance policy for each fixed asset that result from posted insurance-related amounts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Total Value Insures per FA** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.  
5. To see the underlying insurance coverage ledger entries, choose a value in the matrix.  

## To correct insurance coverage entries

If a fixed asset was assigned to the wrong insurance policy, you can correct it by creating two reclassification entries from the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create one journal line for the fixed asset and the correct insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is positive.  
3. Create another journal line for the fixed asset and the incorrect insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is negative.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The fixed asset is removed from the incorrect insurance policy on the second line. The asset is assigned to the correct insurance policy on the first line of the journal.

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.
<br><br>
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a840d10b-557c-4c8d-8186-87f962d876e8]

## To correct a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

## To cancel a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries Extension
Use the Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension to round depreciation and acquisition amounts in fixed asset ledger entries to whole numbers. For example, to round an amount of 30,000.44 to 30,000. Typical causes of rounding issues are data migration, suddenly starting to post amounts to the general ledger, or customizations you've made to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension is pre-installed and ready to go. If you remove the extension, but want to install it again, you can find it on AppSource.

## Troubleshooting Fixed Asset Ledger Entries
When you open the **Fixed Asset Card** page for the first time, the **FA Ledger Entries Scan** job queue entry is scheduled to monitor amounts every Sunday. If it finds amounts that you might want to round, a notification will display the next time you open the Fixed Asset Card page. The notification provides a **See more** option that opens the **FA Ledger Entries with Rounding Issues** page, which lists the entries with amounts that you might want to round. To round the amounts, choose the entries, and then choose the **Accept Selection** action. You can use the **Find entries with issues** action to update the list with new issues that occurred after the job queue entry ran on the previous Sunday.

# Work with assembly BOMs

You use assembly bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from components with little to no resource use. An assembly BOM can be used, for example, to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of component items.

Use assembly orders to make finished items from components in a process that one or more basic resources can perform, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity on an assembly order, the assembly order lines are filled in according to the assembly BOM. The order has one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports production BOMs. Production BOMs differ from assembly BOMs because they involve more complex procedures, such as resource usage, production routing, and work or machine centers. Learn more about the differences at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) and [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## To create an assembly BOM

To define an item that consists of other items, and perhaps the resources that assemble the item, you must create an assembly BOM.  

Assembly BOMs can have multiple levels, which means that a component on the assembly BOM can be an assembly item itself. In that case, the **Assembly BOM** field on the assembly BOM line contains **Yes**.

Special requirements apply to items on assembly BOMs regarding availability. Learn more at [To see the availability of an item by its use in assembly BOMs](inventory-how-availability-overview.md#to-view-the-availability-of-an-item-by-its-use-in-assembly-or-production-boms).

There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM:

- Setting up a new item.
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item.

1. Set up a new item. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

   Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM.  
2. On the **Item Card** page for an assembly item, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Assembly items can have variants, just like any other item, which helps you keep your list of products shorter. Learn more about the feature at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).

## To edit assembly BOMs

You can edit the lines on an assembly BOM at any time. However, the BOM might be in use by ongoing sales or assemblies of the parent. Changing the BOM might affect those activities. Choose the **Where-Used** action to explore the items that use it and whether sales or assembly orders might be affected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Yes** value in the **Assembly BOM** column.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Edit List** action, then change any field as needed.

## To view components and resources indented according to the BOM structure

From the **Assembly BOM** page, you can open a separate page that shows the components and any resources indented according to their BOM position under the assembly item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Show BOM** action.

## To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines

From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item, you can use a special action to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components. This action is useful, for example, if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item.

The **Explode BOM** action is also available on the **Assembly BOM** page as a way to view subassembly items on an assembly BOM.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you have used the **Explode BOM** action, you can't easily undo it. You must delete the sales order lines for the components and then reenter a sales order line for the assembly item.

The following procedure is based on a sales invoice. The same steps apply to other sales documents and all purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item.
3. Choose the line for an assembly item, then **Explode BOM** line action.

All fields on the sales invoice line for the assembly item are cleared except for the **Item** and **Description** fields. Complete sales invoice lines are inserted for the components and possible resources that comprise the assembly item.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Picking List by Order** report is also changed to show the components only. This means that a warehouse worker picking the parent item, the assembly item, will not see it in the picking list. Learn more at [Print the Picking List](sales-how-print-picking-list.md).

## To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item

You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item's assembly BOM.

The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components, including other assembly BOMs, and any resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Calc. Standard Cost** action.
5. Select one of the following options, then choose the **OK** button.

|Option |Description |
|-------|------------|
|**Top Level**|Calculates the assembly item's standard cost as the total cost of all purchased or assembled items on that assembly BOM regardless of any underlying assembly BOMs.|
|**All Levels**|Calculates the assembly's item standard cost as the sum of:</br></br>* The calculated cost of all underlying assembly BOMs on the assembly BOM.</br>* The cost of all purchased items on the assembly BOM.|

The costs of the items that make up the assembly BOM are copied from the component item cards. The cost of each item is multiplied by the quantity, and the total cost is shown in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Updating standard costs with the Standard Cost Worksheet](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-the-standard-cost-worksheet).

# Setup best practices: Reordering policies

The **Reordering Policy** field on item cards has planning methods that determine how the individual planning parameters interact.  

One best-practice foundation for selecting a reordering policy is the item’s ABC classification. When you use ABC classification, you manage items according to three classes. The class you use depends on the item's value and volume relative to the total stock. The following table shows the value-volume distribution of the three classes.

|Class|Percent of total stock volume|Percent of total stock value|
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|A|10-20|50-70|
|B|20|20|
|C|60-70|10-30|

The ABC classification states that effort and money can be saved by applying looser control to items of low value-volume than to items of high value-volume. The following illustration shows which reordering policy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is best suited for A, B, and C items respectively.

![ABC Classification.](media/abc_classification.png "abc_classification")

The following table provides best practices for selecting between the four policies.  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|**Order**|Use for A items.<br /><br /> Use for make-to-order items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for top-level items and for expensive components and subassemblies.<br /><br /> Use for items that are purchased as drop shipments and special orders.<br /><br /> Don't use if you don't accept automatic reservation.|A items, such as leather couches in a furniture store, are high-value items with low and irregular order velocity where inventory is unacceptable, or the required attributes vary. The best reordering policy is therefore one that plans specifically for each demand.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|Use for B items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for components that occur in multiple BOMs. This policy ensures that purchase orders are combined for the same vendor, so better prices can be negotiated.<br /><br /> Use if you aren't sure about which reordering policy to select.|B items, such as dining chairs, have a regular and fairly high order velocity, but also high carrying costs. The best reordering policy for B items is therefore one that is economical by bundling demand in the reorder cycle.<br /><br /> 80 percent of items can use this policy.<br /><br /> Can be used successfully without planning parameters.|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|Use for C items.<br /><br /> Combine with reorder-point parameters.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for lowest-level components.<br /><br /> Don't use if the item is often reserved.|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point.<br /><br /> If the user reserves a quantity for a distant demand, the planning foundation is disturbed. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable regarding the reorder point, the quantities might not be available because of the reservation.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|Use for C items with high carrying costs or storing limitations.<br /><br /> Combine with one or more order modifiers (Minimum/Maximum Order Quantity or Order Multiple).|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point, but below a maximum inventory quantity.<br /><br /> To modify the suggested order, you might want the order quantity to be decreased to a specified maximum order quantity, increased to a specified minimum order quantity, or rounded up to meet a specified order multiple. **Note:**  If used with a reorder point, then inventory stays between the reorder point and the maximum quantity.|

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# The PayPal Payments Standard extension

The PayPal Payments Standard extension can help you increase your customer service levels by making it easier for your customers to pay their bills.

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, customers can pay through their PayPal account. When you send a sales invoice by email, there's a PayPal link in the email body and in the attached PDF document. If the customer chooses the link, the service page for their PayPal account opens and shows the payment details. The customer can then pay the invoice as any other PayPal payment.

The PayPal Payments Standard service provides the following benefits:

* Customer payments arrive faster in your bank account.
* Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
* PayPal offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on web sites.
* PayPal offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, PayPal accounts, and other sources.
* The PayPal link can be added automatically to sales documents or manually by the user.
* The PayPal Payments Standard service doesn't involve monthly fees or setup fees.
* Because it's an extension, you can easily enable the PayPal Payment Standard service when and if your business requires it.  

To learn more about how to set up the extension, go to [Enable Customer Payment Through PayPal](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

## Register payments automatically for business accounts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can register payments automatically if you have a Business Merchant account for the PayPal Commerce Platform. When your customers use the PayPal link to pay an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts the entries and close the document.

To use this capability, on the **Payment Registration Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Register payments automatically** toggle and verify the accounts you'll use for the payments. If you decide that you don't want to register payments automatically, you can turn it off again.

> [!TIP]

# Set up or change the chart of accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before using the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, go to the **Manufacturing Setup** page and turn on the **Load SKU Cost on Manufacturing** toggle. Otherwise, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item, and calculates variances against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> After you assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, run the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action on the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page to roll up the component and capacity costs. Subassemblies use information from items. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

# Pick items with inventory picks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post picking and shipping information for your source documents. Outbound source documents can be sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly order component needs also represent outbound source documents. To learn more about handling production and assembly orders for internal processes, go to [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).
>
> Although service orders are also outbound source documents, they don't support the basic, order-by-order level of complexity.
>
> When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, there are rules you must follow when you create inventory pick lines. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

You can create an inventory pick in three ways:

* Create the inventory pick directly from the source document.  
* Create inventory picks for multiple source documents at the same time by using a batch job.
* Request the pick in two steps by first releasing the source document, which acts as a signal to the warehouse that the source document is ready picking.

The inventory pick can then be created from the **Inventory Pick** page based on the source document.  

## To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a sales order, purchase return order, or outbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create picks only for sales orders.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create the pick in two steps

### To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document

For sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders, you create the warehouse request by releasing the order. Releasing the order makes the items available for picking.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.

### To create an inventory pick based on the source document

After you release an order, the warehouse employee can create an inventory pick.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of document you're picking for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to create a list of all outbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick lines according to the selected source documents.  

## To record inventory picks

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin that the items must be picked from is suggesting per the item's default bin. You can change the bin in this page if necessary.  
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the quantity that in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the shipment of the source document lines that were picked.
    * If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries for the changes to the bin quantity.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks

You can also use the **Inventory Pick** page to pick and ship for sales where items must be assembled before they can be shipped. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

Assemble-to-order items aren't physically in a bin until they're assembled and posted as output to a bin. Picking assemble-to-order items from a bin for shipments follows a special flow.

1. Warehouse workers take the assembly items from bins to the shipping dock, and then post the inventory picks.
2. Inventory picks post the assembly output, the component consumption, and the sales shipment.

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically create an inventory movement when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** field on the **Assembly Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md).

Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways, depending on whether you assemble to order none, some, or all of the sales line quantities. In scenarios where some of the quantity is assembled and some is picked from inventory, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

For sales where the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order, one inventory pick line is created for the quantity. The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is the same as the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The **Assemble to Order** field is selected on the line.

If you set up an assembly output flow for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line contains the value from the following fields, in the following order.

* ***Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** <!-- not applicable for inv pick-->
* **From-Assembly Bin Code**

If a bin code isn't specified on the sales order line, and no assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line is empty. The warehouse worker must open the **Bin Contents** page and select the bin where the assembly items are assembled.

In scenarios where a part of the quantity is assembled and another must be picked, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

* One pick line for the assemble-to-order quantity. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following fields, in this order, to determine the bin code: **Bin Code**, **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code**, and then **From-Assembly Bin Code**. If these fields are blank, the warehouse employee must open the **Bin Contents** page and choose the bin where the items are assembled.  
* The other pick line depends on which bins can fulfill the remaining quantity. If the item is kept in multiple bins, multiple lines are created. The line for the take is based on the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> If items are assembled to order, the inventory pick for the linked sales order creates an inventory movement for all of the assembly components.

# Set up payment terms

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. You can use date formulas to define the payment terms. When you first sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.  

If you assign payment terms to customers and vendors, the same terms are always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. The document dates on sales and purchase documents, not their posting dates, are used to calculate due dates for payments. If needed, you can change the terms on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want a particular customer to pay you within seven days rather than the default 14 days. Changing the terms on the document doesn't change the default payment term assigned to the customer. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents.

When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the payment discounts based on the payment terms. The payment discount date is the last date that the customer can receive a discount. The date is also calculated when you post an invoice.  

Similarly, when you post a credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates payment discounts based on the payment terms. It calculates the discount on credit memos in the same way as discounts on invoices. When you apply a credit memo to an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the discount amount for the invoice by the credit memo's discount amount.  

If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you must set up reminder levels and terms. To learn more about reminders, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).  

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.  

> [!TIP]
> In the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], payment terms don't support partial payments. Instead, you must use the prepayments functionality. To learn more about prepayments, go to [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).
>
> In some countries/regions, you *can* set up payment terms with partial payments. To learn whether your country/region supports this capability, go to the **Local Functionality** section in the table of contents on the left side of a [Microsoft Learn](about-localization.md) article.

## Audit changes to payment terms

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment terms setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for payment terms and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |

# Work with Production Families

A production family is a group of individual items whose relationship is based on the similarity of their manufacturing processes. By forming production families, some items can be manufactured twice or more in one production, which will optimize material consumption.

In the **Quantity** field on the **Family** page, you enter the quantity that will be produced when the whole family has been manufactured once.

## Example

In punching processes, four pieces of the same item can be produced from one sheet and 10 pieces of another, different, item at the same time. The punching machine will punch all 14 pieces in one step.

Forming production families reduces the scrap quantity because what would normally be leftover scrap, when producing big pieces, will be used instead to produce small items.

## To set up a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Families**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To produce based on a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new production order. For more information, see [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. In the **Source Type** field, select **Family**.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the relevant production family.

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows run when an event occurs, like when a record is created, changed, or deleted. You can also run flows on a schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and Non-Microsoft services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type runs automatically when an event happens. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified, or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows start from internal or external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

To explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you, sign in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and select **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find flows created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you might only have the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you didn't agree to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

<!--
You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The page lists both the built-in approval and Power Automate workflows, with options for the latter to enable/disable, delete, and view the workflow on the Power Automate website.-->

# Set Up Customer Price Groups
  
Sales prices can be made dependent on the customer groups to which you sell. These are called customer price groups.

Before you set up customer price groups, you must decide how many groups you want and which customers will belong to each group.  

## How to create sales prices for a group of customers  

When you have agreed on the prices that the group of customers will pay for certain items, you register the agreement for the individual items on the lines in the **Sales Prices** page.

### To create sales prices for a group of customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the customer price group. If a line does not already exist you can create a new line. Select **New** to create a new entity and give it a name.  
    
    For the selected line, verify the contents of the fields **Allow Line Disc.**, **Allow Invoice Disc.**, **Price Includes Tax** and **Tax Bus. Posting Gr. (Price)**. 
  
3. Select the **Navigate** action, and choose **Sales Prices**. The **Sales Prices** page opens. The **Sales Type** field will be filled in with **Customer Price Group**.  
  
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** with the sales code you selected on the previous page.  
  
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Item No.**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the agreed **Unit Price**. You can also show the **Variant Code** column and specify the **Variant Code** if there are several variants of the item.  
  
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the price agreed on, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.  

7. If required, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** of the price agreement.  
  
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code**.

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item that you want to create a Sales Price for.

## How to enter customer price group codes on customer cards  

After you have set up the customer price groups, you can enter the customer price group codes on the customer cards.

### To enter customer price group codes on a customer card  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Open the relevant **Customer Card** for a customer that you want to be part of a customer price group.  

3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Price Group** field, select the **Customer Price Group** code.

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).

# Assemble to project

Assemble to project helps you improve inventory management by assembling to order only when it's required.

When you choose an assemble-to-order item on a project planning line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order. The assembly order is based on the project planning line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly bill of materials (BOM). To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. As in sales, you can't directly post linked assembly orders. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).

Assembly orders are reserved for projects, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes item tracking between project planning lines and assembly order.

## Integrate with warehouse management

Assemble to project integrates with warehouse management features to make assembly and shipping easier. The process also helps ensure that the flow from project assembly to delivery runs smoothly in internal warehouse processes. To learn more about internal warehouse flows for projects, go to [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Jobs](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md#flows-to-and-from-assembly-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

The following table describes the warehouse configurations that assemble to order supports.

|Configuration  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**No warehouse handling**|Use a project journal to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |
|**Inventory pick**|Use an inventory pick to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.          |
|**Warehouse pick**|Create and register warehouse picks for components, and then use a project journal to post usage. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies whether the consumed assembly components were picked. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |

## Known limitations

This section describes known limitations for assemble to project.

* The **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field isn't available for projects that are closed.
* For warehouse pick scenarios, the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** can be either zero or equal to the quantity. You can't mix assemble to order and assemble to stock on a project planning line. You must create separate project planning lines.
* Assemble to order doesn't affect billable parts of a project. An assembly is included on sales invoices, but not its components. You can't edit the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field for billable lines.
* Order planning and the planning worksheet aren't affected because the project is the input for planning. The planning engine considers the assembly as demand.
* You can't enter a negative quantity in the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field.
* You can't undo an assembly.

# Reconcile bank accounts

Bank reconciliation helps ensure that what's in your books matches the statements you receive from your bank. Bank account reconciliation compares and matches entries in the bank accounts you set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bank transactions at your bank. Reconciliation can then post the balances to your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to make them available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover missing payments and resolve bookkeeping errors.

This article describes how to reconcile bank accounts from the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

However, you can also reconcile bank accounts on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page when you process payments. Open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries close when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. This action automatically reconciles the bank account for the payments that you post with the journal. Learn more in [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The North American versions offers the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but doesn't let you import bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, clear the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Learn more in [Reconciling Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

The lines on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page are divided into two panes. The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows either imported bank transactions or ledger entries with outstanding payments. The **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane shows the ledger entries in the internal bank account.

## About bank reconciliation

Reconciling transactions in statements from your bank with bank entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is referred to as *matching*. There are three ways to match transactions with bank entries:

* Automatically, by using the **Match Automatically** action.
* Automatically, by using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action.

  This action is available as part of the bank reconciliation assist (preview) feature, which an AI-powered feature. Learn more in [Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot](bank-reconciliation-with-copilot.md).
* Manually, by selecting lines in both panes to link each bank statement line to one or more bank account ledger entries, and then using the **Match Manually** action.

The **Applied** checkbox is selected on lines where entries match. Learn more in [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md). If you enter a statement ending date on the bank reconciliation after you match its lines with entries, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will undo the matches for lines and entries that are after that date.

> [!NOTE]
> After you enter a date in the **Statement Date** field, the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page filters the bank ledger entries to show only entries up to that date. You can only post bank reconciliations with bank ledger entries on or before the statement ending date. The filter ensures that your bank ledger is balanced with your bank statement on the statement ending date, with the difference being the outstanding payments and checks.

When the value in the **Total Balance** field in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane equals the total value of the **Balance To Reconcile** field plus the **Balance Last Statement** field in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, you can choose the **Post** action. Unmatched bank account ledger entries remain on the page, indicating discrepancies that you should resolve to reconcile the bank account.

Any lines that can't be matched, indicated by a value in the **Difference** field, will remain on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. They represent some kind of discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry.

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

You can fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page in the following ways:

* Automatically, by using the **Import Bank Statement** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane with bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.
* Manually, by using the **Suggest Lines** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.

## Add bank statement lines by importing a bank statement

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.

To import bank statements as bank feeds, you must set up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service. The setup includes linking your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank accounts. Learn more in [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Bank Account No.** field, select the relevant bank account. The bank account ledger entries that exist on the bank account appear in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
4. In the **Statement Date** field, enter the date of the statement from the bank.
5. In the **Statement Ending Balance** field, enter the balance of the statement from the bank.
6. If you have a bank statement file, choose the **Import Bank Statement** action.
7. Locate the file, and then choose the **Open** button to import the bank transactions into the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

## To fill in bank reconciliation lines with the Suggest Lines action

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane is filled in according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the earliest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the latest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Typically, the ending date will match the date specified in the **Statement Date** field. However, if you want to reconcile transactions for only part of a period, you can enter a different ending date.

4. If you don't want the bank account ledger entries to include unmatched open reversed entries, choose the **Exclude Reversed Entries** toggle. By default, the list of bank account ledger entries include reversed entries up to the statement date.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries automatically

The **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page offers automatic matching functionality based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (left pane) with text on one or more bank account ledger entries (right pane). You can overwrite the suggested automatic matching, and you can choose to not use automatic matching at all. Learn more in [Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually](#match-bank-statement-lines-with-bank-account-ledger-entries-manually).

You can investigate the basis for matches by using the **Match Details** action. For example, the details include the names of the fields that contained matching values.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Match Automatically**. The **Match Bank Entries** page opens.
2. In the **Transaction Date Tolerance (Days)** field, specify the span of days before and after the bank account ledger entry posting date within which the action searches for matching transaction dates in the bank statement.

    If you enter 0 or leave the field blank, the **Match Automatically** action only searches for matching transaction dates on the bank account ledger entry posting date.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    The lines are color coded to make it easier to understand what to do with them. Bank statement lines and bank account ledger entries that are matched on the current bank reconciliation change to bold green font. Bank account ledger entries that are matched on other bank reconciliations are shown in italic blue font.
4. To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a mix of manual and automatic matching. If you have manually matched entries, automatic matching will not overwrite your selections.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually

> [!TIP]
> When matching lines and entries manually, the **Show All**, **Show Reversed Entries**, **Hide Reversed Entries**, and **Show Nonmatched** actions can make it easier to get an overview. By default, the bank account ledger entries don't include unmatched reversed entries. To include these entries in the list and match them manually, choose the **Show Reversed Entries** action. If you choose to hide reversed entries after you've made one or more matches, the matched entries are still shown.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't post a bank reconciliation if you do many-to-one matching and the combined amounts contain differences. This is true even if the combined differences balance to zero.
>
> Here's an example of a many-to-one matching that has differences. The value of 200 for bank statement entry 1 is matched to two bank ledger entries that have a total value of 180. The difference is 20. The value of 350 for bank statement 2 is matched to two other bank ledger entries that have a total value of 370. The difference is -20, which balances the value of 20 for bank statement 1.  
>
> To post a bank reconciliation with differences on the lines, post the differences and then match them against the posted entries.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, select an unapplied line in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane.
2. In the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, select one or more banks account ledger entries that can be matched with the selected bank statement line. To choose multiple lines, select and hold the CTRL key, and then choose the lines.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also manually match multiple bank statement lines with one bank account ledger entry. For example, this might be useful if your bank deposit contained several payment methods, such as credit cards from different issuers, and your bank lists those as separate lines.
3. Choose the **Match Manually** action.

    The selected bank statement line and the selected bank account ledger entries change to green font, and the **Applied** checkbox in the right pane is selected.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all bank statement lines that aren't matched.

> [!TIP]
> To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action. If you have matched multiple bank statement lines to a ledger entry, and need to remove one or more of the matched lines, all of the manual matches are removed for the ledger entry when you choose **Remove Match**.

## Validate your bank reconciliation

To double-check your bank account reconciliation before you post it, use the **Test Report** action to preview the reconciliation. The report is available in the following contexts:

* When you're preparing a bank reconciliation on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
* When you're reconciling payments on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

Lines that can't be matched stay on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. These lines contain a value in the **Difference** field. The difference represents a discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Reconciliation page and Test Report assume you're only reconciling within the period up until the statement ending date. If you match a bank statement line to a bank ledger entry before you enter a statement ending date, and then enter a statement ending date that is after the ending date for the bank ledger entry, the data in the Test Report will be incorrect.

The following table describes fields on the Test Report that can help you complete the bank reconciliation.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Statement Date| The date specified in the **Statement Date** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.|
|Balance Last Statement|The balance specified in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. This field is filled in automatically from the most recent reconciliation for the same bank account. The value is zero if it's is your first bank account reconciliation.|
|Statement Ending Balance|The balance specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> | The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. If your bank uses your local currency, this balance should be the same as your bank account balance (shown on the right side of the report header) when you match all statement lines. An empty **()** in the name of this field means that your bank uses local currency.<br><br>A discrepancy in this field and the previous ones might indicate that you posted directly to the G/L account. It might also indicate that you're using the same G/L account for multiple banks, which we don't recommend. Banks are linked to the general ledger through the bank account posting group specified for the account.<br><br>The Test Report shows a warning if you have direct postings, even if the balance for the posting is zero. Direct postings that aren't balanced often lead to accumulated differences for future bank reconciliations. You should check the general ledger balance and ledger entries before you post the bank reconciliation. Learn more in about direct posting in [Avoid Direct Posting](#avoid-direct-posting).|
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance (<*LCY*>) at <*date*>| The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date in local currency. The balance is converted to the bank account's currency using the exchange rate that was valid on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. You compare to this balance to the **G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*>* field if your bank uses a foreign currency. The value in the G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> field for local currency might differ slightly because currency conversion can result in small differences. Your bank's balance should be very close to this balance.  |
|Bank Account Balance at <*date*>| The balance on the bank account at the statement ending date.|
|Sum of Differences    | The sum of the differences for the statement lines. To access the details, turn on the **Print Outstanding Transactions** toggle when you enter criteria for the report. A difference is a bank statement line that isn't matched completely to one or more bank ledger entries. You can't post a bank account reconciliation that has differences. You can post a bank reconciliation that contains bank ledger entries that aren't matched to statement lines. This value is shown in the **Outstanding Bank Transactions** field and in a separate section if you turn on the Print Outstanding Transactions toggle.      |
|Statement Balance     | The value specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.  |
|Outstanding Bank Transactions     | The sum of unmatched, non-check bank ledger entries that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, at the end of a period. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Outstanding Checks     | The sum of unmatched bank ledger entries for checks that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, this can happen for checks if a vendor doesn't cash a check in the same period you registered it. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Bank Account Balance     | The sum of the values for the bank statement ending balance, outstanding bank transactions, and outstanding checks. After you handle all differences on matched entries, this balance matches your bank balance. For example, you accounted for all matched entries and the entries you couldn't match for this bank statement. You can post the reconciliation.        |

> [!TIP]
> If you run the **Test Report** from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** as follows:
>
> * balance last statement + sum of all lines in the payment reconciliation journal
>
> You can use the value to compare to your bank statement.

## To create missing ledger entries to match bank statement lines

Sometimes bank statement contains amounts for interest or fees charged. Such bank statement lines can't be matched because there aren't related ledger entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You must then post a journal line for each transaction to create a related ledger entry that it can be matched with.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Transfer to General Journal** action.  
2. On the **Trans. Bank Rec. to Gen. Jnl.** page, specify which general journal to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The **General Journals** page opens with new journal lines for any banks statement lines that are missing ledger entries.
3. Complete the journal line with information such as the balancing account. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  
4. To review the result of posting before you post, choose the **Test Report** action, and then choose an option for accessing the report. The **Bank Account Statement** report shows the same fields as at the header of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

    After the entry is posted, match the bank statement line to it.
6. Refresh or reopen the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. The new ledger entry appears in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
7. Match the bank statement line with the bank account ledger entry, either manually or automatically.

## Find outstanding transactions in previous periods

You can use the Bank Statement report to find outstanding transactions in previous periods. Outstanding transactions were opened before the statement date and aren't closed, or were closed after the bank reconciliation was posted.

When you run the Bank Statement report from the **Bank Account Statement List** page, you can turn on the **Outstanding Entries** toggle, and the report includes a section that lists outstanding entries.

**Example**
We have bank account ledger entries A, B, and C in our bank account for the month of August. When we reconcile our bank account for August we find a bank statement line that matches entry A, but none for B and C. So we post the reconciliation with entry A reconciled and B and C as outstanding entries.

In September, we receive a payment for entry B and decide to reconcile our bank account. If we run the Bank Statement report before posting the reconciliation, we get one reconciled transaction and one outstanding.

If we print the report for August we get outstanding transactions for our B and C entries, even though we closed entry B in September.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Statement report has some known limitations if you import or manually enter bank transactions after you post a bank reconciliation.
>
> You can enter bank ledger entries on any date and with any posting date, so you don't always have to do it in a strict chronological order.. When you do a bank reconciliation, you reconcile a bank statement to the bank ledger entries you have registered up to the time you post the reconciliation, and with the posting date of the entries. Typically, that means a posting date on or before the statement ending date.
>
> When you post a bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes a snapshot of the data and uses it to fill in the bank statement report's header. But, the outstanding transactions sections are actual lookups to the bank ledger entries that existed up to the actual date and time you posted the bank reconciliation. The totals in the lines typically match the totals in the header. However, if you import bank ledger entries after you posted the bank reconciliation, but the posting dates are before the statement ending date, the totals in the header might not match the totals in the outstanding transactions sections.

## Undo a bank account reconciliation

If you find a mistake in a posted bank reconciliation, you can use the **Undo** action on the **Bank Account Statement List** page to correct it. When you undo a posted bank reconciliation, the entries are moved to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** page and marked as **Open**, meaning they aren't reconciled. You can then correct the bank reconciliation and post it again.

> [!NOTE]
> In the North American version, to use the Undo feature for posted bank reconciliations and bank statements you must turn on the **Bank Recon. with Auto-Match** toggle on the **General Ledger Setup** page. The Undo feature is not available for bank statements posted from bank reconciliation worksheets.

### Reusing the bank statement number

The bank statement number used for the new bank reconciliation is taken from the bank account as is the Balance Last Statement. You can change these values before you start a new bank reconciliation. However, when you create a new bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] checks whether the statement number is already assigned to a posted bank statement. If the number is in use, but you want the new bank statement to use it instead, you can use the **Change Statement No.** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

### Examples

The following examples show how to fix a mistake on a posted bank reconciliation, with or without using the same statement number.

#### Example 1

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, and March. The bank statement number was 100 for March. Later, you discover that March only included entries until the 30th, which means entries for the 31st are missing. So, you need to redo the bank reconciliation for March. In this case, we open the **Bank Account Statement List** page, choose the statement for March, and then choose **Undo**.

The new bank reconciliation is given the statement number 101. To reassign the number 100, choose **Change Statement No.** and enter **100**. 

> [!TIP]
> Remember to set the appropriate Statement ending date (in this example, that is March 31), and edit the **Balance Last Statement** field. 

#### Example 2

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, June, and July. You discover that February was incorrect. Let's assume it had statement number 100. Like Example 1, you use the Undo and Change Statement No. actions to change the statement number as in example #1 and you can now redo February bank reconciliation.  

After you post the corrected bank reconciliation for February, on the corresponding Bank Account card the **Last Statement No.** field will show **100**, and the **Balance Last Statement** field will show the ending balance for the February statement. 

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for March, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will assign 101 as the statement number and give it the correct **Balance Last Statement**.

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for August, consider changing the values in the **Last Statement No.** and **Balance Last Statement** fields on the **Bank Account** card before you create the next bank reconciliation, or use the **Change Statement No.** action and also change the value in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the bank reconciliation page.

> [!NOTE]
> The statement number is important when you do bank reconciliations with imported CAMT files that contain statement numbers, or when you reconcile based on printed bank statements. If you just download a range of bank transactions from your online bank, the statement number is usually not important.  
>
> The Balance Last Statement is kept on the bank account to minimize mistakes when doing bank reconciliations, but it's also editable, allowing you to do your bank reconciliations in any order you want. This also means that if you undo a bank statement, the new ending balance might not be the balance last statement on the next bank statement. There's no feature that allows you to move a balance forward to all subsequent bank statements, so be aware of this when using Undo.  

## Avoid direct posting

Don't use a G/L account that allows direct posting in your bank account posting group. Direct posting breaks the connection between the bank account ledger entry and the G/L account ledger entry. When you reconcile your bank account, the entries posted directly to the G/L account aren't included, which makes it difficult to complete the reconciliation.

This mistake often happens when entering an opening balance for a bank account. It's important that you don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that are posted directly to the G/L account causes problems. For example, these entries might prevent you from reconciling your bank account. For foreign currency bank accounts, the entries can cause differences to accumulate after you post more bank reconciliations due to currency exchange rate adjustments. Often, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount then ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, you reverse it later against the G/L account that you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In both cases, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation, and especially so if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

# Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs

When running reports, users are typically presented with a page that lets them select options and set filters to change the data that is included in the generated report. This page is called the *request page*. A report can include one or more *saved settings* that users can apply to the report from the request page. *Saved settings* are basically predefined options and filters. Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. For more information, see [Use saved settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to *reports*, but similar information applies to *batch jobs*.

If you have the proper permissions, you can view, create, and modify the saved settings for all reports for all users in a company. You can assign saved settings for a report to individual users or to all users in the company.

## Manage saved settings

You manage saved settings on the **Reports Settings** page. There are two ways to open this page:

- Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Settings**, and then choose the related link.
- In a report's request page, choose the lookup in the **Use default values from** field, and then choose the **Select from full list** action.

    This field is only visible if you have run the report at least once earlier. The list will only show settings that are available to you, either because they are your own settings, or because the settings are shared with you.

The **Report Settings** page displays all the existing saved settings entries for all users. If there is a user name in the **Assigned to** field, only that user can use the saved settings for the associated report. If there is a check mark in the **Share with all users** field, all users can use the saved settings for the report.  

> [!TIP]
> When a user has run a report that supports shared settings, their settings are saved and added to this list. In most cases, the admin can then edit those settings and choose to share the settings with all users.
>
> However, in some cases, settings cannot be shared, and the admin cannot change them either. Most batch jobs do not support shared settings.  

## Create or modify saved settings for all users

From the **Report Settings** page, you can:

- Choose the **New** action to create a new saved settings entry from scratch.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Copy** action to create a copy.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Edit** action to modify a saved settings entry.

> [!Important]
> Consider the name that you give a saved settings entry. If you create a saved settings entry for all users, and you give it the same name as an existing saved settings entry that is assigned to a specific user only, then that user will not be able to use the saved settings entry that is assigned to everyone.  In the **Saved Settings** section on the request page, the user will see two saved settings entries with the same name. However, no matter which option they choose, the user-specific saved settings entry will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to save settings is available only on reports where the [SaveValues property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-savevalues-property) of the report's request page is set to **Yes**. The **SaveValues** property is set by the developer.

# Close income statement accounts

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it. To do this, you run the **Close Income Statement** batch job. This job transfers the year's result to an account in the balance sheet and closes the income statement accounts. You do this by creating lines in a journal, which you then can post.

## To run the Close Income Statement batch job

1. Close the fiscal year. The fiscal year must closed before the batch job can be run. For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Close Income Statement**, and then choose the related link.
3. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.

## About the Close Income Statement batch job

The batch job processes all general accounts of the income statement type and creates entries that cancel out their respective balances. That is, each entry is the sum of all the general ledger entries on the account in the fiscal year. These new entries are placed in a journal in which you must specify a balancing account and retained earnings account in the balance sheet before you post. When you post the journal, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and at the same time the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

You must post the journal yourself. The batch job doesn't post the entries automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is being used. When an additional reporting currency is being used, the batch job posts entries directly to the general ledger.

The date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the journal is always a closing date for the fiscal year. The closing date is a fictitious date between the last day of the old fiscal year and the first day of the new year. The advantage of posting on a closing date is that you maintain the correct balances for the ordinary dates of the fiscal year.

The **Close Income Statement** batch job can be used several times. You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the batch job again.

# Sustainability value chain in production

The requirement for enabling the sustainability value chain in manufacturing processes is to enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Work/Machine Center Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entry posting through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields on operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.  
   3. **Work/Machine Center Emissions** to enable default sustainability accounts and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages.  
4. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure the **Carbon Equivalent Factors** on the **Emission Fees** page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

## Working with a production BOM

To learn more about how to work with the **Production BOM**, go to [How to create a production BOM](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md). This article only covers the effect of CO2e emissions on production BOMs.  

If you set up default emissions for items you plan to use on production BOM lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new production BOM. However, if you created a production BOM before you configured emissions for items, or if you updated the emission values for items, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the items. You can even run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Production BOMs** page to update all production BOMs with the latest emissions.

## Working with routings

To learn more about how to work with routes, go to [How to create a route with production operations](production-how-to-create-routings.md). This article only explains the effect of CO2e emissions on routes.

If you set up default emissions for work or machine centers you plan to use in the **Routing** lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new routing. However, if you created a routing before you configured emissions for work or machine centers, or if you updated the emission values for them, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the work or machine centers.

## Working with production orders  

To learn more about how to work with production orders, go to [About production orders](production-about-production-orders.md) and [How to create production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md). However, the connection of production orders with the sustainability value chain is:

- Tracking the emissions for items and work or machine centers consumed during the production process.
- Transferring the total emission values to the produced items or finished goods.  

To use a production order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all posted entries through the journals you use in the production process. You can start the process using a **Released Production Order**. To use the sustainability value chain in production orders, all items (raw materials) and work or machine centers you want to use must have a **Sustainability Account No.** and emissions.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released production orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new production order. To learn more about production orders, go to [How to create a production order](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. Run the **Refresh Production Order** action to calculate values for the line.  
4. After you refresh the order, the value in the **Total CO2e** field updates based on emissions in the production BOM and routing for the production items.

When you refresh the production order, values from the production BOM and routing transfer to the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages for the production order you're using. If you change the initial production BOM and routing, it doesn't affect the production order you refreshed previously.  

To check the emission values, run the **Routing** or **Components** actions from the production order lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Total CO2e** emission amount displays for each line on the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the **Item**, **Work Center** or **Machine Center** pages, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the value in the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

### Posting transactions related to production order  

To post all transactions related to the production order and record the emissions, choose one of the following journals:  

- Production journals
- Consumption journals
- Output journals

#### Production journals  

Production journals combine the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. The combined journal is accessed directly from a released production order. To learn more, go to [How to register consumption and output for a released production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md). Related to emissions, be sure that all lines have a value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

Every time you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries. You can access these entries from the **Release Production Order** page by running the **Sustainability Value Entries** action.  

#### Consumption journals

To learn more about consumption journals, go to [Batch post production consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all consumption transactions. When you post a journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Consumption** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type**.  

#### Output journals

To learn more about output journals, go to [Batch post output and run times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all output transactions based on the routings. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Output** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type** for the finished good production. It also creates transactions for the work or machine centers you used related to the capacity ledger entry.  

### Finish a production order

When you finish a production order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the value of your produced item and the **CO2e per Unit** field on the **Item Card** page for it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field for the produced item by summing the total emissions from all consumed items and operations (work and machine centers), and then divide that by the total output quantity.

# Set Up Service Offerings
When you set up service management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item that needs servicing, for example, the computer that needs repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.

# Set up payment methods

Payment methods define the way you prefer for customers to pay you, and how you like to pay your vendors. The method can vary for each customer or vendor. Examples of typical payment methods are **bank**, **cash**, **check**, or **account**.

You can assign a payment method to customers and vendors so that the same method is always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. If needed, you can change the method on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want to pay a particular purchase invoice in cash rather than by check. The default payment method assigned to the vendor doesn't change.

The same payment methods are used for sales and purchase documents. For example, a _cash_ payment method is used to make payments and to receive them. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] knows that when you're creating a sales invoice you expect to receive payment, and the opposite for purchase invoices.

Credit memos for returns, however, are exceptions because money is flowing in the opposite directions, from you to your customer and from your vendor to you. Therefore, a default payment method isn't assigned to credit memos. There is, however, a workaround. You can specify terms of payment for the customer or vendor. Though the **Calc. Pmt. Disc. on Cr. Memos** field isn't intended for this workaround, if you choose the checkbox on the **Payment Terms** page a default payment method is added when you create a credit memo. <br><br>

## To set up a payment method

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Optionally, add payment terms to your payment method. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Terms](finance-payment-terms.md).  

## To assign a payment method to a customer or vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Payment Method Code** field, choose the method to use by default for the customer or vendor.

## Audit changes to payment methods

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment method setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for payment methods and its ID.

# Get the Business Central add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select the **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [View and Edit in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, it affects Excel files that users created before the transition. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central.

This situation happens because each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action isn't available to users. Learn more in [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- Learn more about preventing users from downloading from the Office store at [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization. Learn more at [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
- Learn more about transitioning from individual acquisition at [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch).

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

In this task, you work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before the add-in deploys automatically in Excel for users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in is either installed automatically for you or you're prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Add-ins** > **More Add-ins**.
1. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see it there, select it, and then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, and then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office add-In* and follow the instructions to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it to the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/240`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel add-in

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, go to [Preparing your network for the Excel add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|

## Known limitations in metadata generation

When using **Edit in Excel** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], either by selecting the **Edit in Excel** action on a page or when the Excel add-in loads after opening an Excel workbook, you might encounter the following error: _Metadata was unable to be retrieved for entity \<entity name\> as it was not found_.

This error occurs when the page you're attempting to modify becomes too complex for **Edit in Excel** to process effectively. The primary cause is the installation of multiple extensions that add fields with identical field names to the same parent page, leading to conflicts. It's also possible for a single extension to block the metadata generation.

### Single extension blocking metadata creation

Consider the following scenario involving extension _A_, which includes the page extension _CustomerCardExtA_ and the page _WebViewerA_ where _PageType = CardPart_.

When metadata is generated for the _Customer Card_ page, the algorithm evaluates each individual field, including those fields added by extensions. However, if extension _A_ is installed, this process fails because _WebViewerA_ doesn't share the same source table as the _Customer Card_ page.

To resolve this issue, you should add a _Customer_ `SourceTable` property to the _WebViewerA_ page. An example of this modification can be observed in the code snippets containing _CustomerCardExtB_ and _WebViewerB_.

In some cases, you might need to embed the `CardPart` on multiple pages without referencing a specific source table. For such scenarios, we recommend creating a separate `CardPart` for each page where you also need to generate metadata and refactoring the shared logic into a codeunit.

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerA"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerB"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple extensions causing collisions

To resolve this issue, there are two potential solutions:

1. **Disable extensions**: To identify which extension is causing the conflict, you can disable extensions that affect the page one at a time. However, this approach might not be ideal if the extensions in question are necessary for your business processes.

2. **Modify extension code**: This solution involves analyzing the root cause of the issue and addressing it by modifying the code of the conflicting extensions.

To better understand this issue, consider the following example involving the **Customer Card** page (ID 21). When you are on the **Customer List** page (ID 22) and select **Edit in Excel**, a web service is generated in the background that exposes the fields from the **Customer Card** page. This web service includes all page fields defined on the **Customer Card** page, while table fields are only exposed if they correspond to a page field or are part of the primary key.

When an extension is installed that extends the **Customer Card** page, the fields added by the extension are also exposed in the web service. While extensions can't create page fields with the same names as those fields already existing on the **Customer Card** page, conflicts can still arise when multiple extensions add fields with identical names.

For example, suppose the following extension, referred to as _A_, is installed:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension A
pageextension 50101 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSize)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50101 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; ShoeSize; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Now, consider that another extension, referred to as _B_, is installed, which also modifies the **Customer Card** page:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension B
pageextension 50102 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSizeField)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50102 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50105; ShoeSizeField; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both extensions A and B add a page field named `ShoeSize` to the **Customer Card** page. This condition results in a conflict, which leads to a metadata generation failure for the **Customer Card** page.

To resolve this issue, you need access to the code of at least one of the extensions, and then to modify the conflicting page field names to avoid collisions.

# Close accounting periods

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it.

## To close accounting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Year** action.

    If more than one fiscal year is open, the earliest one is automatically selected to be closed. A message identifies the year that will close and the results of its closing.
3. To close the year, choose the **Yes** button.

The fiscal year is closed, and the **Closed** and **Date Locked** fields for all the periods in the year are selected. The fiscal year can't be opened again and you can't remove the check mark from the **Closed** or **Date Locked** fields.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't close a fiscal year before you create a new one. Notice that after a fiscal year is closed, you can't change the starting date of the following fiscal year.

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior-Year Entry** field is selected.

After a fiscal year is closed, you must close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. You can repeat this every time that you post to the closed fiscal year.

# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

To help you get started with financial reporting, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the company’s chart of accounts for basic financial reporting.

## Custom financial reporting

If you're already familiar with financial reporting and you want more complex reports, you can create your own.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last 12 months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags you can attach to postings to the general ledger to provide more business insights to financial reporting. Adding dimensions enriches the reports and expands them into operational reporting.

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers in financial reporting that aren't calculated by a formula can take you to the original transactions. You can make active analyses from the financial report to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you format financial reporting so that it looks the same every month, without manual work. Export to Excel makes it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values update each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting doesn't require that you know how to code. Finance professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.

description: You create an assembly BOM or production BOM to specify the components or resources required to put together the item that the BOM represents.

# Work with bills of material

You use bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from other items or produced by resources or machine centers from components.

## Assembly BOMs or production BOMs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports two different types of BOMs:

| BOM type | General category | Example |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| [Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md) | Warehouse / assembly | Items that consist of other items, assembled with basic or no resources. |
| [Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md) | Manufacturing / production | Items that consist of different components and subassemblies, produced at a work or machine center. |

You use assembly orders for making end items from components in a simple process that can be performed by one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity in the header of a new assembly order, the assembly order lines automatically fil in according to the assembly BOM with one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

You use production orders for making end items from components in a complex process that requires a production routing and work or machine centers, which represent production capacities. For example, a production process could be to cut steel plates in one operation, weld them in the next operation, and paint the end item in the last operation. Learn more at [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

A production BOM is the master data that defines a production item and the components that go into it. For assembly items, the production BOM must be certified and assigned to the production item before it can be used in a production order. When you enter the production item on a production order line, either manually or by refreshing the order, then the production BOM content becomes the production order components. Learn more at [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

The concept of resources in production is much more advanced than in assembly management. Work centers and machine centers act as resources. The operations assigned to resources in production routings represent production steps. Learn more at the [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md) article.

Both assembly orders and production orders might be linked directly to sales orders. However, you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Set Up Universal Print Printers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Universal Print is a Microsoft 365 subscription-based service that runs entirely on Microsoft Azure. It gives you centralized printer management through the Universal Print portal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes printers set up in Universal Print available to client users through the **Universal Print Integration** extension.

![Universal Print setup.](media/Universal-Print-arch.png)

The complete setup requires you work in both Microsoft Azure, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup is divided between two main tasks as described in this article:

1. In Microsoft Azure, set up Universal Print and add the printers you want to use in Business Central to a print share. Go to [this section](#set-up-universal-print-and-printers-in-microsoft-azure).
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add the printers from the print shares in Universal Print. Go to [this section](#add-printers-in-business-central-online) for online or [here](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises) for on-premises.

## Prerequisites

- Supported printers

  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the same printers as Universal Print, which can be either Universal Print–compatible or non-compatible printers. Non-compatible printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so they require extra connector software, which is provided by Universal Print. Some older printers may not be supported. 

- Universal Print:

  - A Universal Print subscription/license for your organization.

    Learn more at [License Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).

  - You have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID.

    To manage Universal Print, your account must have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID. These roles are only needed for managing Universal Print. They aren't required by people setting up and  the printers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises:

  - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 or later.
  - **Universal Print Integration** extension is installed.

    This extension is published and installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. You can verify whether it's installed on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only:
  - Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is configured.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Universal Print extension doesn't support service-to-service (S2S) authentication. It requires a signed-in user to send print jobs to the Universal Print service through Graph API.
  - An application for Business Central is registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    Like other Azure services that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Universal Print requires an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Universal Print.

    Your deployment may already use an app registration for other Azure services, like Power BI. If so, then use the existing app registration for Universal Print as well, instead of adding a new one. The only thing you'll need to do, in this case, is modify the app registration to include the relevant print permissions for Microsoft Graph API: **PrinterShare.ReadBasic.All**, **PrintJob.Create**, and **PrintJob.ReadBasic.** 

    To register an app and set the proper permissions, follow the steps described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

## Set up Universal Print and printers in Microsoft Azure

Before you can start managing Universal Print printers in Business Central, there are several tasks to get Universal Print up and running in Azure with the printers you want to use.

For detailed instructions on how to get set up, see [Get started: Set up Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-getting-started) in the Universal Print documentation. Here's an overview of the steps you'll need to complete. Most of these steps are done in the Azure portal.

1. Assign Universal Print licenses to yourself and other users.

    How you assign the license depends on whether you're integrating with Business Central online or on-premises.

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

      Learn more at [Microsoft Admin Center Help - Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you assign licenses in your tenant using the Azure portal.

      Learn more at [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups).

2. Install the Universal Print connector for registering printers that can't communicate with Universal Print directly.

    Most in-market printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so you'll need to install the Universal Print connector. Learn more at [Installing the Universal Print Connector](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-installation).

3. Register your printers in Universal Print.

    Registering a printer makes Universal Printer aware of the printer.

    - For printers that can communicate directly with Universal Print, follow the steps provided by the printer manufacturer.

    - For other printers, register the printers by using the Universal Print connector. 

      Learn more at [Printer registration](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-printer-registration).

4. Change printer properties (optional)

    After a printer is registered, you can view and modify printer properties, such as default preferences.

    Learn more at [Managing Printer Settings using the Universal Print Portal](/universal-print/reference/portal/printer-settings).

5. Share the printers with users.

    Any printer you want to use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will need to be added to a *printer share* in Universal Print. Any user who needs access to the printer must be added as a member of the printer share. Learn more at [Share a Printer](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always add or remover users later. Learn more at [Configure user permssions for printer share](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers#configure-user-permissions-for-a-printer-share).

6. Enable document conversion.

    Universal Print renders content for print in XPS format. Some legacy in-market printers don't support XPS content rendering&mdashin many cases, only PDF format. Printing to these printers will fail unless Universal Print is set up to convert documents to the printer-supported format.

    Learn more at [Document conversion](/universal-print/reference/portal/settings#2-document-conversion).

Now, you're ready to add the printers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up default printers for reports, and print.  

## Add printers in Business Central online

After printers are set up and shared in Universal Print, you're ready to add them to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for use. There are two ways to add Universal Print printers. You can add the printers all at once or individually, one at a time.

Adding printers individually let's you set up the same Universal Print printer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] more than once. Then, for each added printer, you can change the print settings, like paper tray, size, and orientation. This way, you can set up printers for different reports and documents with special output requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? If so, go to the [next section](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises), the first time setup is slightly different.  
<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print**, then choose one of the following options:

   - **Add all Universal Print printers** to add all printers not already added. You can use this option even if there are already printers added.
   - **Add a Universal Print printer** to add a specific printer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    - If you chose **Add all Universal Print printers**, then the **Add Universal Print Printers** setup starts. 

    - If you chose to **Add a Universal Print printer**, then the **Universal Printer Settings** page appears. Fill in the **Name** field, then select **...** next to the **Print Share in Universal Print** field to select the printer share that contains the Universal Print printer. Fill in the remaining fields as needed. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

## Add printers in Business Central on-premises

<!--With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, unlike online, users aren't automatically authenticated with the registered app in Azure used for the Universal Print service. So, before any Business Central user (including admins) can add or even use Universal Print printers, they'll have to authenticate with the Azure app and grant access to the Universal Print service. The following procedure describes how to initiate this authentication flow. Each user typically only has to do this task once.-->

Before a user can add or use Universal Print printers Business Central, they have to authorize access to the Azure services used by Universal Print and grant it to permission to data and operations like:

- Signing in and reading user profile
- Reading basic print job information
- Creating print jobs

This is typically done the first time they connect to the Azure registered app used for Universal Print. In Business Central online does, this authorization flow is done seamlessly, with no user interaction. But Business Central on-premises operates differently. It requires that you, or any other user who wants to use Universal Print printers, initiate the authentication flow&mdash;usually, one time only. The most direct way is described in the following steps. A less direct way is by connecting to another integrated service that uses the same Azure registered app, like Power BI or OneDrive. Each user typically only has to do this task once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, we recommend you complete this task before other users. Then afterwards, inform users who will need to use Universal Print printers how to do it. If the Azure registered app for Universal Print requires admin consent for API permissions, it's easier if you grant consent on behalf of the organization. You can grant admin consent from the Azure Portal or when you run the steps that follow. 

<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->
### Connect to Universal Print for the first-time

Complete these steps to connect to the Universal Print service for the first-time.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print** > **Add all Universal Print printers** to start the **Add Universal Print Printers** assisted setup guide (wizard).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page.

    <!--The MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page appears. You'll be prompted to give consent to Azure Services. You'll be lead through the process of verifying your Microsoft Entra ID setup, checking your Universal Print license, and then adding the printers.-->

   ![Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page](media/azure-ad-services-permissions.png "Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page")

4. Select the **Authorize Azure Services** link.

   1. If the **Permission Requested** page appears, read it carefully and select **Accept** to agree and continue. If you're running as an admin, you can select **Consent on behalf of organization** if you want to consent for all users.

      ![Shows the Azure request permissions page](media/azure-ad-permissions-requested.png "Azure request permissions page").

   2. If you're prompted, sign in using your name and password.

5. When authorization completes successfully, you're returned to the **Add Universal Print Printers** page. Select **Next** > **Finish** to complete the setup.

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

Once you complete the initial sign-in, you can use the Universal Print printers to print reports and other print jobs. For more information, go to [Printing a Report](ui-work-report.md#PrintReport). If you want to add, remove, or change any printers, just go back to the **Print Management** page and select **Universal Print**.

## Common problems and resolutions

In this section, you'll learn about the common problems that users may experience when trying to set up or use Universal Print printers.

### You don't have access to the printer \<your-printer\>.

If a user gets this message when trying to print a document to a Universal Print printer, it may be caused by one of the following conditions:

- The user doesn't have Universal Print licensed assigned to their Microsoft 365 or Azure Active AD account. 
- The user isn't assigned to the printer share in Universal Print.
- (On-premises) The Azure app registration used for Universal Print isn't working or has recently changed since the last time the user signed in.
- (On-premises) The user hasn't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time.

## There was an error fetching printers shared to you.

If a user gets this message when trying to add a Universal Print printer from the **Printer Management** page, it's typically because they haven't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time. 
<!--
### Troubleshooting

#### You don't see the a printer in the 

The printer is not shared in Universal Print.

### You get an error when tryong to add all or a single printer

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| | **Current Assets**| Formula | |Balance at Date    | Yes |
|CA | Cash                | Posting Accounts | 18000..18999 |Balance at Date|     |
|CA | Accounts Receivable | Posting Accounts | 15000..15999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |  Other Receivables  | Posting Accounts | 13000..13999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA | Inventory           | Posting Accounts | 14000..14999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Prepaid Expenses     | Posting Accounts | 16000..16999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Other Current Assets | Posting Accounts | 100000..11999|Balance at Date|    |
|F1 | **Total Current Assets**  | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   |                           | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   | **Long Term Assets**      |            |              |Balance at Date|Yes |
|LTA|Fixed Assets         | Posting Accounts| 10000..12899  |Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Accumulated Depreciation| Posting Accounts|12900..12999|Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Other Long Term Assets | Posting Accounts|17000..17999|19000..19999|Balance at Date|
|F2 |**Total Long Term Assets**|Formula     |   LTA         |Balance at Date | Yes |
|   |                          | Formula    |               |Balance at Date |     |
|F3 | **Total Assets**         |            | F1+F2         | Balance at Date|     |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |
|Description  | Used to hold the words to label each row of the report.        |
|Totaling type| Formula is used in three ways:<br><br>* To add the results of rows together.<br><br>* When combined with a section header or total.<br><br>* When inserting a blank row into the report.<br><br> Posting accounts are used to indicate that the row pulls the result of posted transactions based on the accounts listed in the Totaling column. |
|Totaling | Contains either a range of accounts shown as 10000..11999, or multiple nonconsecutive ranges of accounts shown as 17000..17999\|19000..19999.<br><br> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as CA, which adds all accounts with Row No. of CA.<br><br> Following the general accounting convention of displaying financial report lines in the order of liquidity, general ledger accounts initially appear out of order. Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

| Row No. | Description | Totaling Type | Totaling | Row Type  | Bold  |

# Set up contact sync with Outlook for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In this article, you learn how to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to synchronize contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with contacts in Outlook. For more information the feature, go to [Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook](admin-synchronize-outlook-contacts.md).

## Introduction

Contact synchronization requires using the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with Exchange Online. Previously, basic authentication was also supported, but it's been deprecated and no longer supported with Exchange Online. You can read more about the deprecation at [Deprecation of Basic authentication in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online). This change means that contact synchronization in Business Central may have stopped working on your on-premises environment. This article will explain how to get it working again.

## Prerequisites

- Exchange Online, either a standalone version or through Microsoft 365 plan  
- Access to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Exchange Online
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users have a Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online email account, which is assigned to their accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of user profile in the **Users** list. 

## Set up contact sync

Complete the following steps to set up contact sync. If you're running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (v.14), you'll have to do an extra step that either modifies application code or sets up a connection to Power BI.

1. <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app for Exchange Online API in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

   In this step, you add a registered app in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, Exchange Online requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and Exchange Online.

   Follow the detailed instructions in the developer and IT pro help at [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory). As you go through the instructions, remember the following points:

   - If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set up the app with the Office 365 Exchange Online permissions described in the next bullet.

   - Configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the Office 365 Exchange Online API:

     - Contacts.ReadWrite
     - EWS.AccessAsUser.All

2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 14, do one of the following tasks:

   - Modify page 6700 by changing `FALSE` to `TRUE` in the following line of code in the `OnPageOpen` trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Create new page with the following code on the OnPageOpen trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Set up Power BI by following the instructions at [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](across-working-with-business-central-in-powerbi.md).

   After the solution you choose is in place, ask users to either run the new/modified page or [connect to Power BI](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect). They'll only need to do this step once.

# Set Up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension
A global provider of services to convert payment information to any data format that your bank requires is connected and ready to be enabled in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This is referred to in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension.

You can export payment lines from the **Payment Journal** page to a file or a data stream that you then upload to your bank for automatic processing so that you do not have to make electronic payments individually. For more information, see [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

You can import bank statement files into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a file that you receive from your bank to a data stream that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can import. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

As an alternative to importing bank statements with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, you can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

To import or export bank files, you must set up your own bank account and your vendors' bank accounts. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may impose a limit on the number of lines that can be exported in one file. You will receive an error message if the limit is exceeded. It is recommended that bank statement files do not exceed 1000 lines as the processing time in the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may otherwise increase significantly.

# Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dataverse

You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronization jobs synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are coupled. For records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronization direction and rules, the synchronization jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system.

There are several synchronization jobs that are available out-of-the-box. The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job.
2. VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job.
3. CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job.
4. CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job.
5. SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job.

You can view the jobs on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Default synchronization job queue entries

The following table describes the default synchronization jobs for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

| Job Queue Entry | Description | Direction | Integration Table Mapping | Default Synchronization Frequency (mins) | Default inactivity sleep time (mins) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contacts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. | Bidirectional | CONTACT | 30 | 720 <br>(12 hours) |
| CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] transaction currencies with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currencies. | From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | CURRENCY | 30 | 720 <br> (12 hrs) |
| CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | CUSTOMER | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | VENDOR | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] salespeople with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] users. | From [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | SALESPEOPLE | 30 | 1440<br> (24 hrs) |

## Synchronization process

Each synchronization job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize.  

To synchronize data, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronization jobs, or let the synchronization jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you are using the synchronization job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

- The **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box controls whether new records are created when you synchronize. By default, the check box is selected, which means that only records that are coupled will be synchronized. In the integration table mapping, you can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table so that the integration synchronization jobs will create new records in the destination database for each row in the source database that is not coupled. For more information, see [Creating New Records](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

    **Example**
    If you clear the **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box, when you synchronize customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a new account is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and automatically coupled. Additionally, because the synchronization is bidirectional in this case, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronized. For more information, go to [Synchronization Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

- When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the row type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] depending on the synchronization direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

- With subsequent synchronizations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronization job for the table will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- With bidirectional synchronization, the job synchronizes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## About inactivity timeouts

Some job queue entries, such as those that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], use the **Inactivity Timeout** field on the **Job Queue Entry** page to prevent the job queue entry from running unnecessarily.  

:::image type="content" source="media/on-hold-with-inactivity-timeout.png" alt-text="Flowchart for when job queue entries are put on hold due to inactivity.":::

When the value in this field is not zero, and the job queue did not find any changes during the last run, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the job queue entry on hold. When that happens, the **Status of Job Queue** field will show **On Hold Due to Inactivity**, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will wait for the period of time specified in **Inactivity Timeout** field before it runs the job queue entry again.  

For example, by default, the CURRENCY job queue entry, which synchronizes currencies in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with exchange rates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will look for changes to exchange rates every 30 minutes. If no changes are found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the CURRENCY job queue entry on hold for 720 minutes (twelve hours). If an exchange rate is changed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while the job queue entry is on hold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically reactivate the job queue entry and restart the job queue. 

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically activate job queue entries that are on hold only when changes happen in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Changes in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will not activate job queue entries.

# Sustainability value chain in purchasing

The requirement for enabling the us of the sustainability value chain in the purchase process is to enable the following fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page:

- **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable value chain capabilities in all processes.  
- **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** to enable emission fields in the purchase document lines.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the fields that are related to the sustainability value chain features.  
   1. Select the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field.
   2. Select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with purchase documents

To learn how to work with purchase documents in sustainability, go to [How to record emissions with purchase documents](finance-sustainability-journal.md#purchase-documents).  

If you enabled the value chain on the **Sustainability Setup** page, and created a purchase document with the **Sustainability Accounts** and emissions (minimum one emission), [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically starts the sustainability value chain and posts details to the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates sustainability value entries for items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support emissions from item charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure carbon equivalent factors on the Emission Fees page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

After you post the purchase documents, the results display on the **Posted Purchase Invoice** or **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** pages. To review the results, use the **Find entries** action. In the list of entries, find the sustainability value entry. To open a list of value chain transactions related to your purchase documents, select the entry.  

When you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **CO2e per Unit** field for all items in your purchase document. If the purchase document was the first for this item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value from document. If you already had documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the average model to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** value for your item.

# Invoice projects

During a project, costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It's important to record all costs in the project journal before you invoice the customer. You can invoice customers after the project is finished, or at certain intervals based on an invoicing schedule.

You can invoice:

* Multiple projects using a **Project Create Sales Invoice** task.
* Whole projects, projects within a project, or individual project planning lines using the relevant action in the project pages.
* Combine multiple project planning lines from different projects into a single sales invoice using **Get Project Planning Lines** action on the **Sales Invoice** page.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks:

* When the work to invoice is complete.
* When you reach the date for invoicing set on an invoicing schedule.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters to specify the projects to invoice.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices on the **Sales Invoices** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Project Sales Invoice** action, or use the **Create Sales Invoice** action in the project tasks.

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and specify the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.

    The **Sales Invoice** page opens, showing the quantity that you transferred to the invoice.
9. Make any other changes, and then choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> The procedure is similar for creating, reviewing, and posting a project-related sales credit memo.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## Issue a credit memo for a project

When a credit is due to a customer for something you invoiced for a project, you can create a credit memo to reimburse them. You can issue a credit memo for job planning lines of the types **Billable** or **Both Budget and Billable**. This credit memo ensures that job planning always reflects the correct planned invoice/credit memo lines for the project before you post sales invoices and credit memos. To learn more about sales credit memos, go to [Process sales returns or cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

To issue a credit memo for a planning line, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the project you want to issue a credit memo for.
1. If the **Blocked** field is filled in, clear the field so that you can work with the project.
1. In the **Status** field, change the status from **Completed** to **Open**.
1. Choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
1. Create a new planning line, and enter the same information as the line you want to credit. However, in the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity but as a negative value. For example, if the quantity you want to credit is 10, enter a quantity of -10.
1. Choose the **Create Sales Credit Memo** action.
1. On the **Project Transfer to Credit Memo** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.
1. To review and post the credit memo, on the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales invoices/credit memos** action.
1. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, review the details. If it looks good, post the memo.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Row definitions in Financial Reporting

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

## Create a new row definition

To create a new row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Enter a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description/* field, enter a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Enter an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a row definition

To edit the content of a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the relevant definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts**, **Insert CF Accounts**, and **Insert Cost Types** actions to create a row for each financial element you want to analyze. For example, you might have one row for current assets and another row for fixed assets. For inspiration, explore the financial reports in the CRONUS demonstration company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. You use these identifiers for calculated rows in the **Totalling** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The columns you define in a column definition represent columns three and up on the **Financial Report** page. The first two columns, **Row No.** and **Description**, are fixed.  

1. To format the rows, choose the **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, and **Double Underline** checkboxes. To learn more about formatting, go to [Format your financial reporting](#format-rows-in-your-financial-reports).

## Working with row formulas

A powerful feature in Financial Reporting is that you can use values computed in previous rows in row formulas defined in subsequent rows. Set the **Totaling Type** to **Formula**, and then write your calculation in the **Totalling** field on the same row.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how row formulas work. Your chart of accounts structure might differ from the accounts shown.

| Row No. | Description | Totaling Type | Totaling | ... | Show |
| ------- | ------|-------- | -------- | --- | ---- |
|         | ## Revenue calculation start | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| R      | Product Revenue | Posting Accounts      | 40000..40209                 | | Yes |
| R      | Discounts and Returns | Posting Accounts | 40910..40919 \| 40940..49999 | | Yes |
| F1      | Total Revenue    | Formula               | R                            | | Yes |
|         | ## Revenue calculation end   | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| L       | Total liabilities  | Account Category     | Liabilities                  | | Yes |
|         | Revenue to liabilities | Formula      | F1 / L                          | | Yes |

The example illustrates some different tips and tricks:

* You can use a formula row as a code comment. Remember to set the **Show** option to **No**.
* The formula in row F1 summarizes all numbers from rows with **R** in the **Row No.** field (the Row No. setting doesn't have to be unique).
* You can use results from previous calculations in new row formulas.

## Built-in row definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample row definitions that can help you quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Row definition code | Description | How to use this row definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 | 
-->

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending on how you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports that use them to match your setup.

## Format rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, you can format the rows in a row definition to provide visual cues that make it easier to find key information quickly. For example, lines that calculate totals often use bold font.

The following table describes the different formatting options on a row:

| Formatting property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Bold                | The row header is formatted in bold. | Yes | Yes |
| Italic              | The row header is formatted in italics. | No | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns in the report are formatted with an underline. Typically used rows that display a subtotal. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns in the report are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display a total. | No | Yes |
| New Page            | If you want to make a report with different sections separated by page breaks in the report output (for PDF or print), use this property on a row. This setting inserts a page break after the row.  | No | Yes |
| Show Opposite Sign  | The data in columns is formatted with the opposite sign from how they're calculated. Typically used to show debits in reports as negative amounts with a minus sign and credits as positive amounts. | Yes | Yes |

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over to reports when you use the Export to Excel action. If you often export reports to Excel, you might just use the tools that Excel provides rather than row definitions.

## Adding empty lines in your financial reports

If you want to add an empty line to a financial report, you can add a row and set the **Totalling Type** field.

The following table describes the different formatting options for a row that define an empty line:

| Value of the Totalling Type property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Formula (with empty Totalling value)     | The row is empty. | Yes | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with an underline. Typically used for rows that display a section. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display the final part of a section. | No | Yes |

## Conditionally display rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, the **Show** setting on rows defines whether they show in the report output for PDF or print.

The following table describes the different display options on a row:

| Value of the Show setting | Whether the row displays |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Yes | Row always shows. |
| No | Row never shows. Use this setting for rows that are only used in calculation steps. |
| If any column not zero | If any column in the report has a nonzero value, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |
| When positive balance | If column data in the report has positive values, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |
| When negative balance | If column data in the report has negative values, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |

## Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements

You can use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements. For example, after you set up your account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page, you can choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action and update the underlying financial reports for the core financial reports. The next time you run one of these reports, such as the **Balance Statement** report, new totals, and subentries are added.

Another benefit of using G/L account categories over the G/L accounts in your row definitions is that a change in your chart of accounts structure doesn't affect your financial reports.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how you can use account categories. Your chart of accounts structure and use of account categories might differ from the example.

| Row No. | Description                | Totaling Type    | Totaling    | ... | Show |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --- | ---- |
|         | // Worlds smallest balance sheet | Formula          |             |     | No   |
| A       | Total assets                     | Account Category | Assets      |     | Yes  |
| L       | Total liabilities                | Account Category | Liabilities |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Underline        |             |     | Yes  |
|         | Balance                          | Formula          | A+L         |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Double underline |             |     | Yes  |

> [!NOTE]
> The top-level account categories, such as the **Liabilities** node, are fixed, and you can't add your own. However, you can delete and add account categories at lower levels and define how the related financial report displays.
>
> You should create and structure your own lower-level G/L account categories from scratch, in a hierarchy if needed, rather than try to rearrange the existing ones. For example, you can restructure the **Liabilities** node to contain a new **Equity** node followed by the **Current Liabilities** and **Long Term Liabilities** nodes. Learn more at [Mapping general ledger accounts to account categories](finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Find the reports that use a row definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a row definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with row definitions

Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with row definitions:

* If you add row definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the row definition for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with financial reporting and perhaps changing the row definition.
* Use the **Where-Used** action to learn where a row definition is used before you make any changes to it.
* Before you change a row definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export row definitions](#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions).
* If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial reporting row definitions

You can import and export financial row definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a RAPIDSTART file that compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import row definitions, the records replace existing records with the same names. It doesn't overwrite existing row or column definitions that the report definition uses.

To import or export financial report row definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Row Definitions**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, then choose the **Import Row Definition** or **Export Row Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Troubleshoot Financial Reporting

This article provides resolutions to a few typical problems you might encounter within Financial Reporting.

## Balancing reports to the general ledger

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance to the general ledger. The following are the most likely reasons why.

* A new general ledger account was added to the chart of accounts, but not the financial reporting.
* General ledger accounts are missing from the Totaling accounts.
* General ledger accounts are listed multiple times in the Totaling accounts.
* A formula is missing.
* A formula points to the wrong row number reference.
* A formula doesn't include all the necessary rows.
* A formula includes rows more than one time.
* A formula is making an incorrect calculation.
* A formula incorrectly shows a positive value as negative or a negative value as positive.
* A totaling account is being used on a row instead of a posting account.

## Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports

After you double-check the possible causes stated in the [Balancing reports to the general ledger](#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger) section, if you still have an imbalance, consider running one of the **Trial Balance** reports. These reports can serve as a reference point because they correctly lists all G/L accounts in your chart of accounts and always balance to zero. You can compare this version of the trial balance to the rows of your financial report to identify and correct the error.

When you run the Trial Balance report, fill out the report options as follows for a clean, simple, and balanced report to review.

* In the **Show Comparison** field, choose **Last Year**.
* Turn on the **Actual Balances** toggle.
* In the **Round to** field, choose the lowest value available for your currency.
* Turn on the **Print to Excel** toggle.
* On the **Filter** FastTab, in the **Account Type** field, choose **Posting**.
* In the **Date Filter** field, enter the date for the report. <!--Need a better description here.-->
* Turn off all other toggles and leave all other fields blank.

## Testing a financial report against a data analysis on G/L entries

A different method for testing a financial report than what is described in the [Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports](#testing-a-financial-report-against-trial-balance-reports) section is to use the data analysis feature on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis) page. This allows you to group and summarize amounts by G/L account or G/L account category, and set filters on relevant data properties, such as G/L account, G/L account category, or posting date.

Learn more in [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md).

## Adding check figures

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. You want the figure to calculate to zero, which indicates that the report is correct. When you run financial reporting, a quick glance at the check figure can confirm whether the report is correct.

## When to use net change or balance at date

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports.

An easy way to remember this rule of thumb is to think about what the goal of each report is to the viewer. People use balance sheet reports to find account balances of accounts on a certain date. So, using a Balance at Date column definition makes more sense.

People use income statement reports to explore the activity of each account during a period of time. So, using a Net Change column definition makes more sense.

For experienced accountants, we know that in some cases we can apply either report to analyze accounts. We might want to initially review the balance sheet using Balance at Date, but also use Net Change to see how much activity happened in each account as we review trends over time. We might review the Income Statement initially using Net Change to see the trend of activity over time. But we might also look at the Balance at Date of these accounts to see how much accumulated in them throughout the year.

While there isn't a single correct answer for how to use these different views, there are general conventions accountants use when they design reports for other viewers. These conventions are that the Balance Sheet uses Balance at Date, and the Income Statement uses Net Change.

> [!TIP]
> When you create column definitions, might include **BS** or **IS** in the definition description. Those tags can help report viewers decide which reports should use which column definitions.

# Set Up a Document Exchange Service

As part of the Data Exchange Framework, you can exchange sales and purchase documents with your trading partners without extra steps, such as attaching the documents to email messages as PDF files. For example, when you're ready to invoice a customer, you can post the invoice and send it for payment as a file that your customer can receive in their business management application. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a document exchange service for Business Central on-premises requires some additional steps for authorization. For more information, see [Settings for Business Central On-Premises](#settings-for-business-central-on-premises).

## Connecting with Trading Partners

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tradeshift integration is no longer supported in Business Central and is planned for deprecation. Instead, please try using the new E-Document functionality in Business Central https://aka.ms/bcedocuments.  

Exchanging electronic documents requires a connection to your trading partners. To make it easy to create a secure connection, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is configured to use the Business Central Integration app. The app is available on the Tradeshift App Store, and all you and your business partners need to do is create a Tradeshift account and then enable the app. The Business Central Integration app comes in production and sandbox versions. For example, using the sandbox version is good for testing the document exchange. You can switch between production and sandbox versions by turning the **Sandbox** toggle on or off on the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page. When you do, the information on the **Service** FastTab is updated for you.

Alternatively, if you want to use another service, you must provide information to make the connection. For more information, see [To connect to a document exchange service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md#to-connect-to-a-document-exchange-service).

### To connect to the Business Central Integration app on Tradeshift

You can quickly create a Tradeshift account and get started with the Business Central Integration app from the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page. Choose either the **Activate App** link in the notification or the **App URL** field to go to the app in the Tradeshift app store. On the Login page for Tradeshift, either sign in or sign up.

> [!NOTE]
> After you sign in to your Tradeshift account, the site might not take you to the page where you activate the app. To do that, you can click the link on the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page in Business Central again to go directly to the app.

If you decide to stop using the Business Central Integration app, you should disable it in the Tradeshift app store. 

## To connect to a document exchange service

If you prefer to use another document exchange service, you must provide some information to connect to the service.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Exchange Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**User Agent**|Enter text that can be used to identify your company in document exchange processes.|  
    |**Enabled**|Specify whether the connection to the service is enabled.<br><br> **Note:**  When you enable the service at least two job queue entries are created to send and receive electronic documents. When you disable the service, the job queue entries are deleted.|  
    |**Sandbox**|Specify whether you are connecting to a sandbox version of the document exchange service.|
    |**Sign-up URL**|Specify the web page where you sign up for the document exchange service.|  
    |**App URL**|Choose the link to open the app store and turn the Business Central Integration app on or off.|
    |**Service URL**|Specify the address of the document exchange service, which will be called when you send and receive electronic documents.|  
    |**Sign-in URL**|Specify the URL for the page you use to sign in to the document exchange service. This is the page where you enter your company’s user name and password.|  
    
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Your sign in credentials are automatically encrypted. You cannot turn off encryption.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you cannot connect to the document exchange service because of an authorization issue, it might be because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] cannot automatically renew the access token. For example, this might occur if you have not used the service for some time. You can renew the token manually by using the **Renew Token** action.

### Settings for Business Central On-Premises

To connect Business Central on-premises, you must create an app on the Tradeshift App Store. When you do, use the redirect URL from the **Redirect URL** field on the **Document Exchange Service Setup** page. After you register your app, Tradeshift will provide a client ID and a client secret. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], enter those values on the **Authorization** FastTab on the **Document Exchange Service Setup** page.

If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetClientId and OnGetClientSecret events in codeunit 1410 "Doc. Exch. Service Mgt."

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to find and assign substitute items faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add.

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About item substitution suggestions

To ensure they can fulfill orders quickly, businesses often assign similar items to each other so they can use them as substitutes. For example, substitutes are good to have when the item that was originally requested is out of stock. Finding and assigning the right items to use as substitutes can be time consuming, and that's where Copilot can help. The suggest item substitutions capability for Copilot can speed up the process of finding similar items.

Information about products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the Item table, multiple barcodes are stored in the Item Reference table, and item properties are stored in the Item Attributes table. Copilot uses a large language model combined with embedded search to comb through this information and suggest items that might be good substitutes. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson Tourer**, where *Bicycle* is an item category and *Red* is an attribute.

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator must activate the **Create product information** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with creating and managing product (item) information.

## Suggest item substitutions on item substitution entries

This process describes how to get Copilot to suggest substitute items.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the item you want Copilot to find substitutes for.
3. Choose the **Substitutions** action.
4. On the **Item Substitution Entry** page, choose **Suggest with Copilot**.
5. Review the suggestions. To learn more, go to [Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions](#review-save-discard-or-regenerate-suggestions).

## Adjust the search

By default, the capability uses the item description as search criteria, which you can adjust if you want to fine-tune the search results. To edit the prompt, select the :::image type="content" source="media/edit-pencil.png" alt-text="Edit the prompt."::: icon in the Copilot window. For example, you can add more details to the prompt such as colors, sizes, or other item attributes.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add, review the suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose **Discard** (trash can).
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Insert all**. This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to the **Item Substitution Entry** page. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well. The **Score** field that displays **High (85+)**, **Medium (83-85)**, and **Low (79-83)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

# Convert service contracts that include VAT amounts

Because the VAT rate change tool can't convert service contracts, these contracts must be converted manually. This article describes several alternative methods that you can use for service contract conversion.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This article provides a high-level workflow.  

 The following procedure describes how to correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract that has been created a year in advance.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For this example, you must change your work date to 01.01.2017.  

## To correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contract Management**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Under **Lists**, choose **Service Contracts**.  
3. Create a new prepaid service contract. Enter a start date of **01.01.2017** and an invoice period year for customer **20000**.  
4. To sign the contract, choose the **Sign Contract** action.  
5. Create a service invoice.
6. The invoice is listed as an unposted service invoice. To view the service invoice, choose the **Service** action, choose the **Contract Management** action, and then choose the **Service Invoices** action.  
7. Post the service invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't change the unposted service invoice. Since the service ledger entries are created when the invoice is created, a change in the unposted invoice will not change the already created service ledger entries. However, the VAT entries are created when the invoice is posted. This lets you change the general product posting group and the GSP product posting group on the unposted service invoice.  

### To create a credit memo for VAT difference 
 
The following procedure describes how to create a credit memo that only includes the VAT difference for the already invoiced period starting on **01.07.2017**. In this example, the VAT amount is only posted to the Financial Management module, not to the Service Management module. The VAT entries that are linked to the service ledger entry won't be corrected.  

1. Create a new general ledger account for the VAT difference. This account is used for direct posting of the VAT correction.  
2. Add a new line to the VAT posting setup.  

## To create contract expiration dates in contract lines  

The following procedure describes how to create new contracts by working with contract expiration dates in service contract lines.  

1. On the **Service Contract** page, set the contract expiration date to **30.06.2017**.  
2. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action to automatically create a credit memo for July 2017 to December 2017.  
3. Because the contract has expired, you need to create a new contract for the period with the new VAT rate for July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  

### To create a new credit memo  

The following procedure describes how to create a new credit memo using the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job. Entries that you don't want to correct from January 2017 to June 2017 will be deleted.  

1. Run the VAT rate change tool on July 1, 2017. The general product posting group or the VAT product posting group is changed. For more information, see [Work with VAT on Sales and Purchases](finance-work-with-vat.md).  
2. After running the VAT rate change tool, enter a contract expiration date for the service contract. You can now delete the service contract line and create a new line that is identical to the old one.  
3. Create a new invoice for the period of January 2017 to December 2012 using the new VAT rate.  
4. To create another credit memo, on the **Service Credit Memos** page, choose the **New** action to create a new service credit memo.  
5. Choose the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** action.  
6. After the conversion is complete, VAT and service ledger entries will be correct.

# FAQ for Suggest Number Series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI effect of the suggest number series feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest number series with Copilot?

Suggest number series can help you create number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language.

* Examples of entities are customers, vendors, and items.
* Examples of documents are quotes, orders, and invoices.

The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use to administrate number series. The feature offers two distinct skills that can help you create new or modify existing number series.

## What are the capabilities of suggest number series?

* Create new number series

   Use natural language to effortlessly set up new number series. Provide examples or masks to define how you envision your setup, and have Copilot draft suggestions for you to build upon.

* Modify existing number series

   Have Copilot help you maintain your existing number series. Extending number series can feel tedious. With Copilot, you can use natural language to modify number series and build upon the suggestions from Copilot.

* Prepare new number series for the next year

   Get ready for the next fiscal year by creating new number series ahead of time.

## What is the intended use of the suggest number series?

The suggest number series capability is intended for system administrators who set up and maintain number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It's a tool to transform requirements written in natural language into the number series structure in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was suggest number series evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest number series? How can users minimize the effect of the limitations when using the system?

The feature works best when you use terminology known to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using alternative terminology might produce results that aren't useful.

* Available geographies

   This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

   [!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted as No. Series.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using suggest number series?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest number series. Even if an administrator enables the feature and it's available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create number series?  

No, the use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to create number series. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time. To learn more, go do [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# The C5 data migration extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can also migrate historical entries for general ledger accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> The company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must not contain any data. Additionally, after you start a migration, do not create customers, vendors, items, or accounts until the migration finishes.

## What data is migrated?

The following data is migrated for each entity:

### Customers

* Contacts  
* Location
* Country
* Customer dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Shipment method
* Sales Person
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Customer price group
* Customer invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Customer posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (customer ledger entries)

### Vendors

* Contacts
* Location
* Country
* Vendor dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Invoice discount
* Shipment method
* Purchaser
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Vendor invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Vendor posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (vendor ledger entries)

### Items

* Location
* Country
* Item dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Sales line discounts
* Customer discount groups
* Item discount groups
* Sales price
* Tariff number
* Units of measure
* Item tracking code
* Customer price group
* Assembly BOMs

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Inventory posting setup
* General posting setup
* Item journal batch
* Open transactions (item ledger entries)

> [!NOTE]
> If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies, the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated. Other exchange rates are not migrated.

### Chart of accounts

* Standard dimensions: Department, Cost Center, Purpose  
* Historical G/L transactions  

> [!NOTE]
> Historical G/L transactions are treated a little differently. When you migrate data you set a **Current Period** parameter. This parameter specifies how to process G/L transactions. Transactions after this date are migrated individually. Transactions before this date are aggregated per account and migrated as a single amount. For example, let's say there are transactions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and you specify January 01, 2017 in the Current Period field. For each account, amounts for transactions on or before December 31, 2016, will be aggregated in a single general journal line for each G/L account. All transactions after this date will be migrated individually.

## File size requirements

The largest file size you can upload to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is 150 MB. If the file you export from C5 is larger than that, consider migrating data in multiple files. For example, export one or two types of entities from C5, such as customers and vendors, to a file, and then export items to another file, and so on. You can import files individually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To migrate data

There are just a few steps to export data from C5, and import it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

1. In C5, use the **Export Database** feature to export the data. Then send the export folder to a compressed (zipped) folder.  
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Migration**, and then choose **Data Migration**.  
3. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. Make sure to choose **Import from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012** as the data source.  

## Viewing the status of the migration

Use the **Data Migration Overview** page to monitor the success of the migration. The page shows information such as the number of entities that the migration includes, the status of the migration, and the number of items that have been migrated and whether they were successful. It also shows the number of errors, lets you investigate what went wrong and, when possible, makes it easy to go to the entity to fix the issues. For more information, see the next section in this article.  

> [!NOTE]
> While you are waiting for the results of the migration, you must refresh the page to display the results.

## How to avoid double-posting

To help avoid double-posting to the general ledger, the following balance accounts are used for open transactions:  

* For vendors, we use the A/P account from the vendor posting group.  
* For customers, we use the A/R account from the customer posting group.  
* For items, we create a general posting setup where the adjustment account is the account specified as the inventory account on the inventory posting setup.  

## Correcting errors

If something goes wrong and an error occurs, the **Status** field shows **Completed with Errors**, and the **Error Count** field will show how many. To view a list of the errors, you can open the **Data Migration Errors** page by choosing:  

* The number in the **Error Count** field for the entity.  
* The entity, and then the **Show Errors** action.  

On the **Data Migration Errors** page, to fix an error you can choose an error message, and then choose **Edit Record** to view the migrated data for the entity. If you have several errors to fix, you can choose **Bulk-Fix Errors** to edit the entities in a list. You still need to open individual records if the error was caused by a related entry, though. For example, a vendor won't be migrated if an email address one of their contacts has an invalid format.

After you fix one or more errors, you can choose **Migrate** to migrate only the entities you fixed, without having to completely restart the migration.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have fixed more than one error, you can use the **Select More** feature to select multiple lines to migrate. Alternatively, if there are errors that are not important to fix, you can choose them and then choose **Skip Selections**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have items that are included in a BOM, you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it. If an item variant is created first, the reference to the original item can cause an error message.  

## Verifying data after migrating

One way to verify that your data migrated correctly is to look at the following pages in C5 and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

|Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 | Dynamics 365 Business Central| Batch Job to Use |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
|Customer Entries| General Journals| CUSTMIGR |
|Vendor Entries| General Journals| VENDMIGR|
|Item Entries| Item Journals| ITEMMIGR |
|G/L Entries| General Journals| GLACMIGR |

## Stopping data migration

You can stop migrating data by choosing **Stop All Migrations**. If you do, all pending migrations are also stopped.

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

> [!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

#### Add fields from related tables

> [!NOTE]
> Adding fields from related tables is available from version 26.2 and to use it, you must have the **Add Related Fields** permission set. 
>
> The feature is enabled with the feature key `Add fields from related tables in analysis mode`. Learn more in [Add fields from related tables in analysis mode feature key](analysis-mode-feature-key.md).

Starting with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 26.2, analysis mode allows you to add fields from related tables to your analysis view. For example, if you're analyzing the **Customer** page, you can add fields from the **Location** table. You can then group data by these related fields, enabling a more comprehensive and advanced data analysis.

To add fields from related tables, you select the **Add columns from** option from the **Analysis** context menu. Now, you see the tables related to the current page's source table as suggestions. When you choose the related table, an **Insert column(s) from** dialog opens with all the fields that are available in that table. You can also use the **Choose a source page** dropdown to navigate through and find fields that you'd like to see in your analysis view. When you have chosen the field or fields to add, these are added to the **Columns** pane and to the data area. Use the **Remove related columns** option to remove the related fields from the analysis tab. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-view-add-columns.png" alt-text="Add columns from option":::

If you want to see all table suggestions, choose **Other source...** from the **Add columns from** menu. This opens an **Insert column(s)** dialog, where you pick the source and related table, the source page they are available on, and then the field or fields to show on your analysis view.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-view-other-source.png" alt-text="Add columns from another source":::

##### Things to check

If you don't find the table or field that you're looking for, there are a few things to check:

- The table must be related to the source table of the page you're analyzing. 
- You must have permission to access the table or field. If you don't have permission, the field won't be available in the list of fields to add.
- The field must be a field that can be added to the analysis. For example, you can't add fields that are internal or not allowed in customizations.
- The table or field must have a page associated with it. If the table or field doesn't have a page, you won't be able to add it to the analysis.
- Certain types of fields, such as Media fields, aren't supported in analysis mode.
- When you add related fields, all calculated fields are lost. 


### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Row group</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Columns that only have a few possible values are the best candidates for using in column **Values**.

## Want to Export data to Excel?

Right-click on the data area or a selection of cells to export data.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-export-to-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to export data from an analysis to Excel":::


## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

# Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The **Item Availability** page is part of Sales Order Agent for checking item availability during the sales order-taking process. This article provides a detailed overview of how the **Item Availability** page functions, including configuration and field descriptions.

![Screenshot of Item Availability page](media/soa-item-availability-page-clip.svg "Screenshot of Item Availability page")

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Overview

Admins can set up Sales Order Agent to select only available items for sales quotes or orders. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

When this capability is turned on, Sales Order Agent uses the **Item Availability** page to check an item's availability before adding it to the quote or order. If an item isn't available, reviewers are notified by a **Request Assistance** step in the timeline for the task in the **Task** tab.

![Screenshot of the Sales Order Agent task tab that shows a request-for-assistance step about item availability](media/soa-item-availability.png "Screenshot of the Sales Order Agent task tab that shows a request-for-assistance step about item availability")

As a reviewer, use the **Item Availability** page to verify that items are unavailable. Decide whether to stop the task or let the agent proceed. You can't change items and quantity at this point. If you confirm the step, the agent creates an email to the customer about the unavailable items for your review.

<!--
Here's the general flow:

1. Select **Review** or the **Item Availability** link to open the **Item Availability** page.
1. Verify that the items in question are unavailable. Refer to the next section for details about how the page works.
1. When you're finished reviewing availability, return to the confirmation step in the **Tasks** tab and select **Confirm**.

The agent creates an email about the unavailable items for your review.
-->

## How to check item availability page

Before the agent calculates the availability and prices for requested items, it searches for the customer making the request, retrieves the customer's specific location, and then sets the **Customer No.** and **Location Filter** fields on the **Item Availability** page.

After setting these fields, the agent calculates the availability of each item in the request one at a time. The agent sets the **Date filter** with the customer's requested delivery date, if any, and the **Quantity Filter** to the requested quantity, currently only in the base unit of measure.

As a reviewer, these fields aren't automatically set to the values the agent used. To check availability, set the fields manually based on the customer's request.

For each item, the following fields are calculated:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|Requested Quantity Available|Indicates whether the quantity of items requested by the customer, specified by the **Quantity Filter** field, is available. If the **Quantity Filter** is less than or equal to the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)**, the item is available, and the checkbox is selected. If the **Quantity Filter** field is greater than, the item isn't available, and the checkbox is cleared. |
|Available Quantity (Base UOM)|Shows the projected available balance of item quantity on the date specified by the **Date Filter**. Calculated by adding the current item inventory in ledger entries to the items in scheduled receipts (inbound transactions like purchase and transfer orders). Then, subtract the items in gross requirements (outbound transactions like sales, service, and production orders). You can select the value to display the totals for item ledger entries and each receipt type. Then, you can drill down to view the source of these totals.|
|Unit of Measure Code|Shows the item's sales unit of measure code. If the field is empty, the base unit of measure is used.|
|Unit of Measure|The item's sales or base unit of measure description. Learn more in [Set Up Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).|
|Available Quantity|Shows the available quantity in base unit of measure (UOM) recalculated to the sales unit of measure.|
|Unit Price Including Discount|Shows the items' price including discount calculated for a specified customer on a specified date. Learn more in [Record special sales prices and discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).|
|Availability Level|Shows the level of the item's availability, such as ***Available** or **Out of Stock**. The value is calculated based on the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)** compared to the **Safety Stock Quantity** specified on the item or storekeeping unit card. Learn more about safety stock in [Design Details: Balancing supply and demand](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).|

# Set up bank accounts

Use bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in your local currency or a foreign currency. After you set up bank accounts, you can also print checks. Bank accounts also offer features for [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md), [bank reconciliation](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md), and the import and export of bank files.

You can include bank accounts in transactions in general journal. Each bank account links to an account in the chart of accounts through the assigned bank account posting group. Using a bank account in a payment transaction automatically creates an entry in both the bank account and the connected general ledger (G/L) account.  

Bank accounts work differently depending on whether a currency code is specified:

- If a currency code isn't specified, all transactions in the bank account are in the local currency (LCY) for the current company. If you make a transaction for the account in another currency, the amounts post to the account in LCY based on the currency exchange rate. Any checks issued from this account must be in LCY. If the bank account is used in a journal, the journal line automatically uses the blank currency code.  
  
- If a currency code is specified, all transactions made to this account, and all checks issued from it, must use the same currency as the account.

You can save time on data entry by making a bank account the default account to use for the currency specified for the account. If you do, the account is assigned to sales and service documents that use the currency. To make the account the default for sales and service documents, on the **Bank Account Card** page, turn on the **Use as Default for Currency** toggle. If needed, you can choose a different account when you're working on a document.

A bank account is an integral part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and plays a role in many other capabilities. The following illustration shows the most important relations:

![Illustration of bank account relations.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank_Account_Relations.png)

Creating a bank account makes it available in all the places shown in the illustration, and are mirrored in the G/L account and on the **Company Information** page.

Bank accounts are often monitored daily to ensure new payments from customers are registered as quickly as possible. Registering payments quickly helps ensure a customer's actual status is reflected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Keeping the status of customer payments current helps sales people, accountants, and other employees making unnecessary calls regarding overdue invoices or delays in shipments.  

![Illustration of bank payment.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank-payment-flow.png)

Another task is to import vendor currency payments with the realized currency rates to make sure that the actual status of the vendors is up-to-date. Using the [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) capability is the easiest way to do that. In the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, you can import bank transactions directly from an online bank application and post them more or less automatically. The journal automatically identifies and posts the following transactions:  

- Direct debit payments from customers.  
- Customer payments of single invoices.  
- Lump-sum payments from customers.  
- Customer payments in foreign currencies.  
- Vendor payments.  
- Vendor payments in foreign currency.  
- Vendor payments and subscriptions that are recurring.  
- Bank charges and interests.  

Payment reconciliation provides significant time savings in posting incoming and outgoing payments. However, the transactions on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't considered 100% correct until you run a bank reconciliation.  

Bank reconciliation is how you make sure that the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the external account at the bank.  

 ![Illustration of bank account reconciliation.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/BankReconciliation.png)

In the illustration, the left side represents the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the rightmost side represents transactions imported from the bank through the online bank application. The diagram in the middle shows the transactions from both sides that make up the bank reconciliation.

From the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], most transactions should be known to the physical bank. The few exceptions include the following cases:  

- Corrections posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
- Checks issued that aren't cashed.
- Vendor payments not yet approved by the bank.  

From the physical account at the bank, transactions not identified in the payment reconciliation journal arrive all the time, such as the following transactions:  

- New vendor subscriptions  
- Customer payments without description
- Bank interest
- Bank charges
- Credit card charges not yet reported

The better you are at mapping information in the payment reconciliation journal, the more transactions are posted automatically and the easier periodic bank reconciliation becomes.

The following video shows the basic steps to set up a bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To enter an opening balance

To fill in the **Balance** field with an opening balance, you must post a bank account ledger entry with the amount in question. You post the entry through a bank account reconciliation. Learn more at [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  
>
> Alternatively, you can implement the opening balance as part of general data creation in new companies using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup guide. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that were posted directly to it typically prevent you from reconciling the bank account. With foreign currency bank accounts, direct posting results in differences that accumulate as you post more bank reconciliations. Usually, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, later you can reverse it out of the G/L account you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In either case, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation&mdash;especially if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

## To set up your bank account for import or export of bank files

The fields related to the import and export of bank feeds and files are on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Bank Account Card** page. Learn more at [Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account to export or import bank files for.
3. On the **Transfer** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** page. You'll be informed of wrong or missing setup values when you export the file. Read the short descriptions of the fields carefully or refer to the related procedure topics. For example, exporting a payment file for North American electronic funds transfer (EFT) requires that both the **Last Remittance Advice No.** and the **Transit No.** fields be filled in. Learn more at [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

The fields on the **Transit** FastTab on the bank account serve different purposes, depending on whether the payment is inbound or outbound.

The following illustration shows the route of inbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

1. The transactions are exported from the bank account in either a human-readable .csv format or the bank's own format.
2. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
3. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
4. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
5. The payments are imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

        ![Illustration of payments received from the bank into bank accounts.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/payments-in-and-out-1.png)

  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Incoming payments are always imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or directly into the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. In contrast, outgoing payments can originate from any payment journal. The only prerequisite is that the **Allow Payment Export** field in the relevant payment journal batch must be selected.

The following illustration shows the route of outbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

6. The transactions populate in a payment journal that was prepared for exporting payments to file.
7. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
8. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
9. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
10. The payments are exported from the payment journal and imported into the bank account.

## To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files

Fields on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Vendor Bank Account Card** page are related to the export of bank feeds and files. Learn more at [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

[!INCLUDE[purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

## Changing your bank account

To use a different bank account for your business, you must create the new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We recommend that you don't just replace the information about the account you're currently using because that can cause incorrect data. For example, your opening balance might be incorrect or your bank feed might stop working correctly. It's important that you keep the current and new accounts separate.

After you create the new bank account, you should also create a new bank posting group and assign it to a new general ledger account. You can reuse an existing bank posting group, and bank transactions are posted to the same general ledger accounts as other bank accounts sharing that bank posting group. However, we recommend that you create a new bank posting group and general ledger account so that reconciliations are easier to do.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the bank account information on open sales invoices still shows the original bank account. Accordingly, payments are likely to still be posted to that account. We recommend that you keep both accounts active for a period of time after the change.

To get a more condensed view of your cash accounts in financial reporting, use the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts in your chart of accounts, the **Totaling** rows in financial reports, or G/L account categories. Learn more at [Business Intelligence and Financial Reporting](bi.md) section.

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.
