# Ad-hoc analyses in purchasing

This article explains how to analyze purchasing data from list pages and queries using the **Data Analysis** feature. The feature lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. Data Analysis provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My vendors," or "Purchasing statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of purchase processes:

- [Purchase Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9307&layout=analysis)
- [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis)
- [Posted Purchase Invoices](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios for purchasing

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report
- If there isn't a report for your specific needs
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of purchasing scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Example: goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview

To create a goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518) list page.
1. Personalize the page to add the **Amount Received Not Invoiced** field. To personalize the page, choose **Settings**, and then **Personalize**.
1. Choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. In the **Additional Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right), set the following filters:
    - **Type = Item**
    - **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY) > 0**. 
1. Drag the **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Add the **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** field to include it on the overview.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI)**, or something that describes this analysis.

## Example: finance (accounts payable)

To see what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Year** and **Due Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right).
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Payable Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Example: finance (accounts payable) - vendor ledger entries on hold

To see vendor ledger entries on hold, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **On Hold** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Payments On Hold**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on purchasing

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries:

- For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Supplier Ledger Entry** table, and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase might result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:
  - **Item Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Item type.
  - **G/L Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the G/L Account type.
  - **Resource Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Resource type.
- In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

# Setup best practices: Reordering policies

The **Reordering Policy** field on item cards has planning methods that determine how the individual planning parameters interact.  

One best-practice foundation for selecting a reordering policy is the item’s ABC classification. When you use ABC classification, you manage items according to three classes. The class you use depends on the item's value and volume relative to the total stock. The following table shows the value-volume distribution of the three classes.

|Class|Percent of total stock volume|Percent of total stock value|
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|A|10-20|50-70|
|B|20|20|
|C|60-70|10-30|

The ABC classification states that effort and money can be saved by applying looser control to items of low value-volume than to items of high value-volume. The following illustration shows which reordering policy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is best suited for A, B, and C items respectively.

![ABC Classification.](media/abc_classification.png "abc_classification")

The following table provides best practices for selecting between the four policies.  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|**Order**|Use for A items.<br /><br /> Use for make-to-order items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for top-level items and for expensive components and subassemblies.<br /><br /> Use for items that are purchased as drop shipments and special orders.<br /><br /> Don't use if you don't accept automatic reservation.|A items, such as leather couches in a furniture store, are high-value items with low and irregular order velocity where inventory is unacceptable, or the required attributes vary. The best reordering policy is therefore one that plans specifically for each demand.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|Use for B items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for components that occur in multiple BOMs. This policy ensures that purchase orders are combined for the same vendor, so better prices can be negotiated.<br /><br /> Use if you aren't sure about which reordering policy to select.|B items, such as dining chairs, have a regular and fairly high order velocity, but also high carrying costs. The best reordering policy for B items is therefore one that is economical by bundling demand in the reorder cycle.<br /><br /> 80 percent of items can use this policy.<br /><br /> Can be used successfully without planning parameters.|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|Use for C items.<br /><br /> Combine with reorder-point parameters.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for lowest-level components.<br /><br /> Don't use if the item is often reserved.|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point.<br /><br /> If the user reserves a quantity for a distant demand, the planning foundation is disturbed. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable regarding the reorder point, the quantities might not be available because of the reservation.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|Use for C items with high carrying costs or storing limitations.<br /><br /> Combine with one or more order modifiers (Minimum/Maximum Order Quantity or Order Multiple).|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point, but below a maximum inventory quantity.<br /><br /> To modify the suggested order, you might want the order quantity to be decreased to a specified maximum order quantity, increased to a specified minimum order quantity, or rounded up to meet a specified order multiple. **Note:**  If used with a reorder point, then inventory stays between the reorder point and the maximum quantity.|

# Procurement Quick Start

To be able to buy products and services, you must first set up vendors. Once that is done, you can start registering purchase orders and receiving invoices.  

## Set up vendors

The following video shows you how to set up a vendor in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

### Set up a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when you register vendors, see [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  

## Create new purchase orders

When you buy something from a vendor you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a purchase invoice. However, you must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity was not available at the vendor.

The following video shows you how to create a purchase order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=f04b1ed3-5cb0-4fa8-8cd0-24069ee893d2]

### To create a purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Order.

3. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Header** are now filled with the standard information about the selected vendor.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase order lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Order Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the order.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase order, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md).  

## Create a purchase invoice  

You create a purchase invoice to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Creating a purchase invoice is similar to creating a purchase order.

### How to create and post a purchase invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Invoice** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Invoice.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected vendor.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase invoice, see [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Defer revenues and expenses

To recognize revenues or expenses in a later period than the transaction posted in, you can set up a schedule to automatically defer them.

To distribute revenues or expenses to accounting periods, you set up a deferral template for the resource, item, or G/L account that the revenue or expense is for. When you post the sales or purchase document, the revenue or expense is deferred to the accounting periods you specify in the deferral template and the posting date.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales and purchase journals validate the source code. The validation requires that the source code for sales journals and purchase journals aren't identical when you're using deferrals. If the source code is set up to be identical, you can work around this limitation by creating a template and batch that use another source code.

## To set up a G/L account for deferral

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary to create a G/L account for deferred revenues. For more information, see [The General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create a new G/L account for deferred expenses.

For both types of deferral, select **Balance Sheet** in the **Type** field, and name the accounts appropriately, such as *Unearned Income* for deferred revenues and *Unpaid Expenses* for deferred expenses.

## To set up a deferral template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Deferral Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Calc. Method** field, specify how to calculate the value in the **Amount** field for each period on the **Deferral Schedule** page. You can choose between the following options:

   * **Straight-Line**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed according to period length.
   * **Equal per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed evenly on periods.
   * **Days per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of days in the period.
   * **User-Defined**: The periodic deferral amounts aren't calculated. You must manually fill the **Amount** field for each period in the Deferral Schedule page. To learn more, go go [To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice](#to-change-a-deferral-schedule-from-a-sales-invoice).
5. In the **Period Desc.** field, specify a description that shows on entries for the deferral posting. You can enter the following placeholder codes for typical values. The values are added automatically when the period description displays.

   * %1 = The day number of the period posting date
   * %2 = The week number of the period posting date
   * %3 = The month number of the period posting date
   * %4 = The month name of the period posting date
   * %5 = The accounting period name of the period posting date
   * %6 = The fiscal year of the period posting date

Example: The posting date is 02/06/2025. If you enter “Expenses deferred for %4 %6”, the description display "Expenses deferred for February 2025".

## To assign a deferral template to an item

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you assign a deferral template to a G/L account or a resource.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item for which revenues or expenses must be deferred to the accounting periods when the item was sold or purchased.
3. On the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, in the **Default Deferral Template** field, select the relevant deferral template.

## To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you change a deferral schedule, for expenses, from a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a sales invoice for an item that has a deferral template assigned. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

    Notice that as soon as you enter the item (or resource or G/L account) on the invoice line, the **Deferral Code** field is filled with the code of the assigned deferral template.
3. Choose the **Deferral Schedule** action.
4. On the **Deferral Schedule** page, change settings on the header or values on the lines, for example, to defer the amount to another accounting period.
5. Choose the **Calculate Schedule** action.
6. Choose the **OK** button. The deferral schedule is updated for the sales invoice. The related deferral template is unchanged.

## To preview how deferred revenues or expenses post to the general ledger

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you preview how expense deferrals are posted.

1. On the **Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Preview Posting** action.
2. On the **Posting Preview** page, choose the **G/L Entry** action, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.

G/L entries to be posted to the specified deferral account, for example, Unearned Income, are denoted by the description that you entered in the **Period Desc.** field in the deferral template, for example, "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To review posted deferrals in the Sales Deferral Summary or the Purchasing Deferral Summary report

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you review the Purchasing Deferral Summary report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Deferral Summary**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales Deferral Summary** page, in the **Balance as of** field, enter the date up to which you want to see deferred revenues.
3. Choose the **Preview** button.

## To specify a period in which to allow deferral posting

You can specify a period in which people can post transactions by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields as follows:

* For all users, on the **General Ledger Setup** page
* For specific users, on the **User Setup** page

If you do that, you must make an exception for deferrals to allow them to be posted outside the period. To define the period, follow these steps.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup** or **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Allow Deferral Posting From** and **Allow Deferral Posting To** fields, enter a start and end date for the period.

### Video guidance

The following video shows how to define the period in which you allow people to post deferred revenue and expenses, and how to specify exceptions.

# Managing payables

A large part of managing accounts payable is paying your vendors, or reimbursing your employees for expenses. You can use functions to add payments lines for purchase invoices that are due on the **Payment Journal** page. To send transactions to your bank, you can export multiple payment journal lines to a file, and then upload the file to your bank. You can also make payments by check, including transmitting checks as electronic payments.

Another typical task is to apply outgoing payments to their related vendor or employee ledger entries in order to close purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, or employee accounts as paid. You can do this on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file to register the payments. The payments are applied to open vendor, customer, or employee ledger entries by matching payment text and entry information. There are various ways to review and change the matches before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

Alternatively, you can apply outgoing payments manually on the **Payment Journal** page or from the related vendor or employee ledger entries.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks within accounts payable, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Finding Related Entries for Documents

Learn how to find documents and entries that are related to each other based on a piece of common information, like:

- Document number or posting date.
- Business contact type, number, or external document number.
- Item serial number or lot number.

This feature is useful for finding the ledger entries that resulted from certain transactions. When you search by document number, you can print the summary from the **Document Entries** report.

## Get started

The find entries feature is readily available from almost any page by pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> keys. From pages that specifically display posted documents or posted document entries&mdash;for both lists and cards&mdash;you can also open the feature by choosing the **Find entries** action.

The **Find Entries** page includes all related documents and entries based on the document no. and posting date. The page is divided into three sections:

- The top section displays fields and actions that you use for filtering your search.
- The middle section displays related documents based on the search.
- The bottom section displays information about the source document that was found by searching.

## Search for entries

You can search for entries based on information about either the document, business contact, or item reference. On the top section, select one of the following options based on the type of information you have:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
| **Search for documents** | View entries based on a specific document number or posting date. |
| **Search for business contacts** | View entries based on a specific contact type, contact number, and/or external document number. This last option allows you to search for vendor or customer documents by using the number assigned by the contact. |
| **Search for item references** | View entries based on a serial number or lot number. You can enter the lot number or serial number, or filter on the lot number or serial number that you want to search for. This action is useful to see where a specific item tracking number was used, what vendor it came from, or what customer it was sold to. |

After you make a selection, enter the relevant search information in the fields at the top of the page. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] When you're finished, choose **Find** to start the search. If you change any of the filters, you have to choose **Find** again.

> [!TIP]
> For a couple of examples about using **Find Entries**, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md) and [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).

# Reconcile vendor payments with the payment journal or from vendor ledger entries
When you send a payment or receive a refund from a vendor, you must decide whether to apply the payment or refund to one or more open entries. You can specify the exact amount that you want to apply to the payment receipt or refund, and then only partially apply vendor ledger entries. You must apply all vendor ledger entries to obtain correct vendor statistics and reports of the account statements and finance charges.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Vendors may sometimes give a payment refund instead of a credit memo to offset against future invoices, especially when you return items that you have already paid for or when you have overpaid an invoice.

You can apply vendor ledger entries in three different ways:

* By entering information in dedicated pages, such as the **Payment Journals** page and the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page.
* From purchase credit memo documents.
* From vendor ledger entries after purchase documents are posted but not applied.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If the **Application Method** field on the vendor card contains **Apply to Oldest**, then payments will automatically be applied to the oldest open credit entry if you do not manually specify which entry to apply to. If the application method for a customer is **Manual**, then you must apply entries manually.

You can apply vendor payments manually to their related purchase documents when you post the payments on the **Payment Journals** page. For information about filling the payment journal, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

You can also apply vendor payments, and customer payments, after the payments appear as negative bank transactions in your bank. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, you can use functions for bank statement import, automatic application, and bank account reconciliation. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

## To apply a payment to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Payment Journals** page, on the first journal line, enter the relevant information about the payment entry.
3. To apply a single vendor ledger entry:
   1. In the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, choose the field to open the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the entry to apply the payment to.
   3. On the line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
4. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the lines with the entries to apply the payment to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

      If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the Applied Amount field, and you can see whether the application balances.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the payment journal.

## To apply a credit memo to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the credit memo that you want to apply.
3. Enter the relevant information in the header.
4. To apply a single vendor ledger entry, on the **Application** FastTab, in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, select the entry to apply the credit to, and then, in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
5. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. Select the lines with the entries to apply the credit memo to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

       If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field, and you can see whether the application balances.
6. Choose the **OK** button.  
   The **Purchase Credit Memos** page shows the entry that you have selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** field and the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field. The page also shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any payment discounts.
7. Choose the **Post** button to post the purchase credit memo.

## To apply posted vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor with entries that have already been posted.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the open entries for the vendor.
5. Select the line with the entry that will be applied.
6. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.

    The **Applies-to ID** field displays three asterisks if you work in a single-user system or your user ID if you work in a multiuser system.  
7. For each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

    If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. You can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field at the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
8. Choose the **Post Application** action.  

    The **Post Application** page opens with the document number of the applying entry and the posting date of the entry with the most recent posting date.
9. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

## To apply vendor ledger entries in different currencies to one another
If you buy from a vendor in one currency and make payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.

If you apply an entry (Entry 1) in one currency to an entry (Entry 2) in a different currency, the posting date on Entry 1 is used to find the relevant exchange rate to convert amounts on Entry 2. The relevant exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. In that case, you must enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the payment journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the payment journal.
6. Post the payment journal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies to one another, the entries are converted to USD. Even though the exchange rates for the two relevant currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when these foreign-currency amounts are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** field on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the relevant vendor ledger entries.

## To unapply an application of vendor entries
When you unapply an erroneous application, correcting entries that are identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field is created and posted for all entries, including all general ledger posting derived from the application, such as payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that were closed by the application are reopened.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Register new items

Items, among other products, are the basis of your business, the goods, or services that you trade in. Each item must be registered as an item card.

## To create a new item card

The following video shows how to set up an item on the Item Card page. However, you can also set up new items by copying existing ones. To learn more, go to [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

## Use item templates

To reuse settings for different types of items when you create new items, you can save items as item templates. Item templates help speed-up the process of adding new items, and increase consistency in your item data. When you register a new item, a page appears that lets you choose a template. After you choose a template, its settings are filled in for you on the item you're creating. If you only have one item template, new items always use that template. 

### Save an item card as an item template

1. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Item Template** page shows the item card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Dimensions**. The **Default Dimensions** for the selected item open showing any dimension codes that are set up for the item.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes that apply to new item cards created by using the template.
5. When you complete the new item template, choose the **OK** button.

The item template is added to the list of item templates, so that you can use it to create new item cards.

## Types of items

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory.

* **Inventory** specifies that the item is a physical unit that you manage and track in inventory.
* **Non-Inventory** are physical units that you don't manage or track in inventory.
* **Service** items are a labor time unit, typically used to register sells or purchase of services.

To learn more about these types of items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

> [!TIP]
> There are also catalog items, which are similar to non-inventory items in that they're items that you offer to customers but don't manage until you sell them. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).  

## Inventory costing

In the **Costing Method** field, you set up how the item's unit cost is calculated by making assumptions about the flow of physical items through your company. Five costing methods are available, depending on the type of item. To learn more about costing, go to [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you select **Average**, the item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. With this setting, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** page to view the transactions that were used to calculate the average cost.

## Categories, attributes, and variants

[!INCLUDE[inventory_variant](includes/inventory_variant.md)]

Learn more about variants at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).  

## Set up item substitutions

You can set up items to have replacements, such as other items that can be used in place of the original item.

> [!TIP]
> If you know your item catalog well, or only have a few items, you might want to specify the substitute items yourself. However, if you have a larger portfolio, the suggest item substitutes capability for Copilot can help. Copilot can suggest substitute items based on item attributes. To learn more about the AI capability, go to [Find item substitutions faster with Copilot](suggest-item-substitutions-copilot.md).

### To make an item substitution

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Find the relevant item, and then choose the **No.** to open the Item Card.  
3. Choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Substitutions** to open the **Item Substitution Entry** page.  
4. Choose the **Substitute No.** field, and then select the replacement item from the list.
5. Fill in or change other fields on the page as necessary.

When the requested quantity exceeds the quantity that is available in inventory, a message appears to inform you that substitute items exist.

> [!NOTE]  
> Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

## Prices and discounts

You can use special prices or discounts that you grant for the item based on certain criteria. For example, criteria include the customer, minimum order quantity, or ending date. You set up special prices by choosing the **Set Special Prices** or **Set Special Discounts** actions. Each row on, for example, the **Sales Prices** page represents a special price. Each column represents a criterion that must apply to grant a customer the special price that you enter in the **Unit Price** field on the **Sales Prices** page. To learn more about pricing, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Replenishment

You can specify how items are supplied:

* **Purchase Order** if you want to buy items.
* **Assembly order** or **Production order** if you produce the items in-house.

There are other settings that compliment these selections.

### Include items in bills of materials

You can structure hierarchies that have a main item with underlying component items in assembly and production bills of materials (BOM). To learn more about BOMs, go to [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

### Items used in production orders

To register items that you use in production orders, specify the replenishment system as **Prod. order** on the **Replenishment** FastTab. For more information, see [About Production Orders](production-about-production-orders.md).  

### Primary and alternate vendors

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor, you can connect those vendors to the item. Use the **Vendors** action on the **Item Card** page to open the **Item Vendor Catalog** page. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant item, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Vendors** action.  
4. Choose the **No.** field, and then select the vendor that you want to set up for the item.  
5. Optionally, fill in the remaining fields.  
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each vendor that you want to buy the item from.

The vendors appear on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, which you open from the item card, so that you can easily select an alternate vendor.

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor additionally you can set up prices and discounts discounts.  For more information, see [Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Manage inventory in warehouses

When you register a new item, you see fields that are related to warehouse management, especially on the **Warehouse** FastTab. If your organization doesn't use the warehouse management capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then you can ignore those fields.  

If your organization later sets up warehouse management, we recommend that you make sure that each existing item has the right information in the various fields. This way, the warehouse processes can run as expected. The information can includes fields such as **Warehouse Class Code** or **Put-away Template Code**. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Planning

When your company uses the supply planning processes in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must fill in the relevant fields on the **Planning** FastTab. For an introduction to the planning area, see [Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md).  

For examples of how you can use the fields on the **Planning** FastTab, see [Setup Best Practices: Planning Parameters](setup-best-practices-planning-parameters.md).  

## Delete item cards

If you post a transaction for an item, you can't delete the card because the ledger entries might be needed for inventory valuation or auditing. To delete item cards with ledger entries, contact to Microsoft partner to do so through code.

# Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Reserve items

You can reserve items for sales orders, purchase orders, service orders, assembly orders, transfer orders, and production orders. You can also reserve items in inventory or inbound on open document or journal lines. You do this on the **Reservation** page.

Each line you open to reserve items on the **Reservation** page displays information about one type of line (sales, purchase, or journal) or inventory entry. The lines describe how many items are available to be reserved from each type of line or entry.

> [!TIP]
> Based on the quantities you’ve reserved in inventory, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a status on the documents so that you’re quickly aware of the next step. For example, to indicate that you can ship a sales order or start to work on a project, assembly, or production order. The status also helps reduce the risk of accidental partial shipments or hold-ups due to missing stock for production and assembly orders.
>
> The **Reserved from stock** field can help you understand whether you can ship or pick for a specific order or order line. For lines, the Reserved from stock field is available on FactBoxes. To access the information for the entire order, the field is on the **Statistics** page.

## Reserve items for sales

The following procedure describes how to reserve items from a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase, service, transfer, and assembly orders.
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the sales order.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action. The **Reservation** page opens.  
4. Select the line you want to reserve the items from.  
5. Choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Function**|**Description**|
    |------------------|---------------------|  
    |**Auto Reserve**|To automatically reserve items on the **Reservation** page.|  
    |**Reserve from Current Line**|To reserve the items from the document on the line you have selected.|  
    |**Cancel Reservation from Current Line**|To cancel reservation of the items in the document on the line you've selected.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If item tracking lines exist for the sales order, the reservation system will take you through special steps. Learn more in the [To reserve a specific serial or lot number](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md#reserve-a-specific-serial-or-lot-number) section.  

## Reserve an item for a production order line

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve parent items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Functions** group, choose the **Reserve** action.
5. On the **Reservation** page, select the Sales Line, Order Line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.

## Reserve items for production order components

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve component items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, then choose **Components**.  
5. Select the relevant component line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select a line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production component line is now reserved.

## Reserve items in bulk

Use the **Reservation Worksheet** page to reserve and allocate incoming goods in bulk. For example, bulk reservations can help ensure that quantities are available for your sales and production orders. You can have multiple batches for different purposes. For example, you might allocate production orders on a weekly basis but reserve daily for sales.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reservation Worksheet**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Demand** action. The **Get Demand to Reserve** page opens.
1. On the **Get Demand to Reserve** page, specify the kind of demand you want to reserve from available inventory.
1. Fill in the filters as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Optional: To allocate the items right away, choose the **Allocate** action.
1. On the **Allocation Policy** page, choose a policy for each step.

   |Allocation policy  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Basic (No Conflicts)     | Allocates stock to a demand if there are no conflicts and the demand can be fully covered. For example, you have sales order A with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If you have 20 in stock, both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, no stock is allocated. You must manually allocate the quantity.        |
   |Equally    | Distributes available stock to demand equally. For example, you have a sales order with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If your stock level is 20, then both demands will receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, then both demands will get 6.        |
   |By Customer Priority|Distribution based on the **Priority** field on the **Customer Card** page. In cases of low inventory quantities, Business Central supplies higher-priority customers first.|

6. To reserve all lines where **Accept** is turned on, choose the **Make reservation** action.
    
## Change a reservation

You can change an item reservation.

1. From the document line you made the reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action.
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, update the **Quantity** field on the line you want to change.
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **OK** button.

## Cancel a reservation

You can cancel an item reservation.

1. From the document line you want to cancel a reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action on the **Lines** FastTab.  
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, choose the **Cancel Reservation** action.  
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **Yes** button.  

## Reserve a specific serial or lot number

From outbound documents for item-tracked items, such as sales orders or production component lists, you can reserve specific serial or lot numbers. For example, reserving specific serial or lot numbers can be useful in the following situations:

* If you need production components from a specific lot to ensure consistency with earlier production batches.
* Because a customer has requested a specific serial number. 

Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

This practice is referred to as a specific reservation, because you reserve from the quantity of item X that belongs to lot X. In contrast, if you reserve only from quantities of item X, then it's simply a normal, non-specific, reservation. Learn more at [Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Create a sales order line for an item-tracked item.  
3. Assign serial and lot numbers to the sales order line. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).
4. On the sales order line, choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. Choose the **Yes** button to reserve specific serial or lot numbers.  
6. On the **Item Tracking List** page, select the serial and lot number combination you have assigned.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to open the **Reservation** page showing only supply with the specified item tracking number. If there are any non-specific reservations on any of the item tracking numbers you've specified for this line, you're informed of the quantity that has already been reserved.  
8. Choose either the **Auto Reserve** or the **Reserve from Current Line** action to create the reservation of the specific item tracking numbers.

# Register new vendors

Vendors provide the products you sell. Each vendor you purchase from must be registered with a vendor card.

Before you register new vendors, you must set up various purchase codes to select from when you fill in vendor cards. After all the required master data is created, you can add unique characteristics for a vendor, such as prioritize the vendor for payment purposes or list items that the vendor and other vendors supply. Another group of setup tasks for vendors is to record your agreements concerning discounts, prices, and payment methods. Learn more at [Setting Up Purchasing](purchasing-setup-purchasing.md).

Vendor cards hold the information required to buy products from each vendor. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
<br /><br />  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

## Adding new vendors

You can add new vendors manually, by filling out the **Vendor Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create templates for different types of vendor profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new vendors, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> If vendor templates exist for different vendor types, when you begin to create a new vendor card you'll see a page from which you can select the appropriate template. If only one vendor template exists, then new vendor cards always use that template.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected vendors. To create a template, fill in the information you want to reuse on the **Vendor Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the Vendor Card Page as a template](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Vendor Template** page when you create a template. For example if want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a vendor from a contact. Learn more in the [Creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

Remit-to addresses are used when you print checks to pay your vendors, and vendors can have multiple remit-to addresses for payments. For example, a vendor might supply an item from a subsidiary company, but wants to receive payment at their headquarters. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you set up multiple mailing addresses for each vendor, and you can choose the correct location to send payments to on an invoice-by-invoice basis.

You specify remit-to addresses on Vendor Card pages, and on the Shipping & Payments FastTab on purchase orders and invoices. When you create payment journal lines using the Pay Vendor or Create Payment actions on the Vendors list page or Vendor Card page, or the Apply Entries action on a payment journal, the remit-to code on the vendor ledger entry is assigned. You can overwrite this value.

### To create a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you do not know the invoicing address to be used for every invoice from a vendor, do not fill in the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab. Instead, choose the pay-to vendor number after you have set up a purchase quote, order, or invoice header.

The vendor is now registered, and the vendor card is ready to use on purchase documents.

If you want to use this vendor card as a template when you create new vendor cards, you can save it as a vendor template. Learn more in the [To save the vendor card as a template](#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

### Deleting and editing vendor information

You can edit the information on vendor cards at any time. However, if you have posted a transaction for a vendor, you cannot delete the card because the ledger entries may be needed for auditing. To delete vendor cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) on a vendor bank account without the change affecting your historical credit transfer register entries. Credit transfer register entries store the *Recipient IBAN* and the *Recipient Bank Account No.* specified in the **Vendor Bank Account** and **Recipient Name** fields from the **Vendor Card** page when the entries were created.

> [!TIP]
> You can add alternative addresses on vendor cards by choosing the **Order Addresses** action.

## To save the vendor card as a template

1. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Vendor Template** page opens showing the vendor card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the vendor.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes to apply to new vendor cards created using the template.
5. When you have completed the new vendor template, choose **OK**.  
   The vendor template is added to the list of vendor templates, so you can use it to create new vendor cards.

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |
       |Matched Quantity | Specifies the quantity that is applied to the purchase order line. |
       |Proposal | Specifies the action that Copilot proposed for matching the purchase order lines. |
       |Learn Matching Rule | Specifies whether to create a matching rule for this proposal. If you select this checkbox, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates item references for items and text to account mappings for G/L accounts. |

    1. All fully suggested and matched lines are marked with green color. If there's an issue, for example, a different price but within the allowed price range, this line is marked with a yellow color. If there's any similarity between the description fields but the price difference is larger than allowed, this line is marked with a red color.
    1. If you aren't satisfied with some suggestions, you can delete them using the **Delete Line** action.  
    1. If you want to see proposal matchings, you can select the link in the **Proposal** column to open the **E-Document Match Details** page.
    1. On the **E-Document Match Details** page you can compare details from the **E-Documents** and **Purchase Order**, to be sure about the suggested matching before confirming it.
    1. After reviewing, close the page.

1. If you aren't satisfied with most of the suggestions, or if you don't want to use the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** feature, select **Discard it**. You can create the matches manually. To learn more, go to[manual matching](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md).  
1. If you want to keep suggestions, select **Keep it**.
1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] closes the Copilot prompt and lines on the **Purchase Order Matching** page are marked as green.  
1. You can continue to work as if you're doing a manual matching. For example, you can remove, create, or reset matches. If you don't want to change anything, just select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action and continue to work with the purchase order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select the **Match with Copilot** action from the **Purchase Order Matching** page again. If you do, you're asked whether you want to overwrite the existing matches.  

> [!NOTE]
> Price/Cost analysis and the check for available quantity are preprocessing activities.

# Set Up a Document Exchange Service

As part of the Data Exchange Framework, you can exchange sales and purchase documents with your trading partners without extra steps, such as attaching the documents to email messages as PDF files. For example, when you're ready to invoice a customer, you can post the invoice and send it for payment as a file that your customer can receive in their business management application. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a document exchange service for Business Central on-premises requires some additional steps for authorization. For more information, see [Settings for Business Central On-Premises](#settings-for-business-central-on-premises).

## Connecting with Trading Partners

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tradeshift integration is no longer supported in Business Central and is planned for deprecation. Instead, please try using the new E-Document functionality in Business Central https://aka.ms/bcedocuments.  

Exchanging electronic documents requires a connection to your trading partners. To make it easy to create a secure connection, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is configured to use the Business Central Integration app. The app is available on the Tradeshift App Store, and all you and your business partners need to do is create a Tradeshift account and then enable the app. The Business Central Integration app comes in production and sandbox versions. For example, using the sandbox version is good for testing the document exchange. You can switch between production and sandbox versions by turning the **Sandbox** toggle on or off on the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page. When you do, the information on the **Service** FastTab is updated for you.

Alternatively, if you want to use another service, you must provide information to make the connection. For more information, see [To connect to a document exchange service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md#to-connect-to-a-document-exchange-service).

### To connect to the Business Central Integration app on Tradeshift

You can quickly create a Tradeshift account and get started with the Business Central Integration app from the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page. Choose either the **Activate App** link in the notification or the **App URL** field to go to the app in the Tradeshift app store. On the Login page for Tradeshift, either sign in or sign up.

> [!NOTE]
> After you sign in to your Tradeshift account, the site might not take you to the page where you activate the app. To do that, you can click the link on the **Doc. Exch. Service Setup** page in Business Central again to go directly to the app.

If you decide to stop using the Business Central Integration app, you should disable it in the Tradeshift app store. 

## To connect to a document exchange service

If you prefer to use another document exchange service, you must provide some information to connect to the service.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Exchange Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**User Agent**|Enter text that can be used to identify your company in document exchange processes.|  
    |**Enabled**|Specify whether the connection to the service is enabled.<br><br> **Note:**  When you enable the service at least two job queue entries are created to send and receive electronic documents. When you disable the service, the job queue entries are deleted.|  
    |**Sandbox**|Specify whether you are connecting to a sandbox version of the document exchange service.|
    |**Sign-up URL**|Specify the web page where you sign up for the document exchange service.|  
    |**App URL**|Choose the link to open the app store and turn the Business Central Integration app on or off.|
    |**Service URL**|Specify the address of the document exchange service, which will be called when you send and receive electronic documents.|  
    |**Sign-in URL**|Specify the URL for the page you use to sign in to the document exchange service. This is the page where you enter your company’s user name and password.|  
    
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Your sign in credentials are automatically encrypted. You cannot turn off encryption.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you cannot connect to the document exchange service because of an authorization issue, it might be because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] cannot automatically renew the access token. For example, this might occur if you have not used the service for some time. You can renew the token manually by using the **Renew Token** action.

### Settings for Business Central On-Premises

To connect Business Central on-premises, you must create an app on the Tradeshift App Store. When you do, use the redirect URL from the **Redirect URL** field on the **Document Exchange Service Setup** page. After you register your app, Tradeshift will provide a client ID and a client secret. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], enter those values on the **Authorization** FastTab on the **Document Exchange Service Setup** page.

If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetClientId and OnGetClientSecret events in codeunit 1410 "Doc. Exch. Service Mgt."

# Post transactions directly to the general ledger

You use general journals to post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts.  

A typical use of the general journal is to post employees expenses during business activities for reimbursement. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employee Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

General journals post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts. Entries are created even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group. You can personalize your version of a general journal by setting up a journal batch or template. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

Entries that you post with documents require a credit memo process. However, you can reverse entries that you post with the general journal. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

## To post a transaction directly to a general ledger account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all transactions that you want to post.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple transaction lines before a balance-account line, for example for one bank account, select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. The **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the transactions.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the transactions on the specified G/L accounts.

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article describes how to install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps are specific to each functional area of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps include:

- APIs for reading data.
- [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models and reports.
- Pages that embed the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- Navigation links on Role Centers and Role Explorer.

## Prerequisites

To install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must have:

- An environment in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (it comes ready to integrate with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].)

- Entitlements/permissions in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] to:

    - Install template apps from AppSource.
    - Use shared workspaces.

The prerequisites for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] can be met with a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license for the following users:

   - The user who installs the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app.
   - The user who refreshes the data.
   - Each user who accesses the reports, either in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service or embedded in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

An alternative to using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses is to use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] or [!INCLUDE [fabric-name](includes/fabric-name.md)] Premium capacity.

To learn more, go to [Get started with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-working-with-powerbi.md#get-started).

## Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

Each app consists of two parts:

- A connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports.

You must install and configure both apps for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports to work.

### Installing the connector (AL) app

The connector apps are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app

Template apps are available to install from Microsoft AppSource. To install or update one or more of the template apps, go to one of the install links in the following table and select **Get it now**.

| To get the template app for... | Use this install link             |
|--------------------------------| --------------------------------- |
| Finance                        | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-finance-app                 |
| Sales                          | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-sales-app                   |
| Purchasing                     | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-purchase-app                |
| Inventory                      | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-inventory-app               |
| Inventory Valuation            | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-inventory-valuation-app     | 
| Manufacturing                  | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-manufacturing-app |
| Projects                       | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-projects-app      |

Sign in to Microsoft AppSource using your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account credentials. Follow the instructions to install the app in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].

After you install it, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app appears under **Apps** in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], and there's a workspace with the same name that you can use to configure the app.

When you install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] subscription, you must choose a workspace for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and reports. We recommend that you use one workspace for each app because it's easier to set up functional boundaries with access controls for users and user groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app, you need a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license.

### Need Power BI apps for multiple companies?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## Run the Connect to Power BI assisted setup guide

After you install your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, you can configure them to suit your business:

- Get help with the set-up process by using the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.
- Set up things yourself on the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page.

The assisted setup guide helps you configure the following components:

1. [Calendar Type](#configure-the-calendar-type)
1. [UTC Offset](#specify-the-utc-offset)
1. [Date Table Range](#set-up-a-date-table-range)
1. [Work Days](#specify-work-days)
1. [Report Mapping](#map-embedded-reports)

### Configure the calendar type

Choose the type of calendar the year boundaries apply to.

- **Fiscal**: A 12-month calendar that begins in any month and ends 12 months after.
- **Standard**: A 12-month calendar that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.
- **Weekly**: A calendar that supports 445, 454, or 544 week groupings. The first and last day of the year might not correspond to a first and last day of a month, respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, all [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports are configured to use Fiscal Calendar date fields and Fiscal Time Intelligence measures.

<!-- If you choose a calendar type other than Fiscal, you will need to edit the Power BI reports and change the date field references and measure references accordingly.  -->

### Specify the UTC offset

The UTC offset defines the UTC time zone in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] date table.

The UTC offset allows your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model to accurately calculate what the current day is in respect to your geographical location. This setting is necessary because your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps might be hosted in a data center located in a different region.

UTC offsets are based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] time zones.

### Set up a date table range

The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields are set automatically based on your accounting periods in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Based on these dates, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] generates a series of continuous dates for your date table.

> [!NOTE]
> If your budgets extend past the last date in your Account Period table, you must manually set the ending date to accommodate the extended range.

### Specify work days

You can define the days of the week you consider as work days. The default setting is Monday to Friday.

### Map embedded reports

To enable the embedded report pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up links to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service.

1. For each functional area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select the ellipsis to open the **Select Power BI Workspace** page.
1. Select the workspace where you store the corresponding [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app.
1. Select the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report (app) you want to map.

## Restrict the amount of data that loads to Power BI

If you want to restrict the amount of data that loads to the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], you can define filters on each app.

On the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page, choose an app for which you want to set up data filtering. The semantic models use these settings when they refresh the data.

All apps support start and end date filtering, where you specify the start and end date of an interval.

Some apps also support other filter options, such as *Start/End Date* or *Relative Date*. With the *Relative Date* type, you can apply a custom date formula.

## Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central

Do this part of the configuration in the semantic models in your [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com).

Each semantic model requires two parameters:

- Environment (holds the environment name)
- Company (holds the company name. The company parameter is case sensitive. )

You can find these values in the connection details of the assisted setup guide or on the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page.

To set or change values for the parameters, open the app workspace in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Locate the semantic model, and choose **More options**. Now choose **Settings**, and then **Parameters**.

## Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)

Each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app is based on a semantic model (also known as a dataset) that gets data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] APIs. Make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing* the model. Depending on your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] setup, refreshing might not happen automatically. You can refresh data manually, or by scheduling a refresh. You can do a manual refresh at any time. A scheduled refresh lets you refresh data automatically at defined time intervals.

To learn more, go to [Refresh [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models](/dynamics365/business-central/across-working-with-powerbi#work-with-power-bi-reports).

## Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries

For dimension set entries to show up in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, the job queue entry that runs the *Update Dim. Set Entries* codeunit must run at least one time. If you change dimension sets or values, the codeunit must run again. Therefore, we recommend that you run the corresponding job queue entry one time each week, or maybe once a night outside normal working hours.

## Want links to show up in Report Explorer?

The profiles (roles) selected to display in the Role Explorer control the functional areas that show in Report Explorer. To specify whether profiles display, turn on or turn off the **Enabled** and **Show in Role Explorer** toggles on the **Profiles** page.

> [!TIP]
> For the built-in profiles that show in Report Explorer, the **Description** field contains **Navigation menu only**.

## Permissions

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the user account you use to refresh the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] must have **Read** permissions to the tables in the model. The tables are documented in the KPI article for the app. For example, for the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app-name](includes/power-bi-sales-app-name.md)], to explore the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables that a user needs Read permissions for, go to [KPIs and measures in the Power BI Sales app](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md).

In the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], we recommend that you add multiple admins for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app workspace. Grant Read permissions to users who should be able to view report pages in an app.

For the embedded pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are permission sets for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app. If you need to exclude read access to all or some of these pages, you can exclude the permission set (or permission on individual pages) for the users.

## Governance of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspaces

Consider having the template app workspaces highly governed and not used directly for the embedded experience. To learn more, go to [Workspace governance level](/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning#workspace-governance-level).

Instead, consider having a single workspace per company that you use for the embed experience. In this workspace, keep copies or custom versions of the template reports. This helps mitigate the problem of losing report customizations when you upgrade the template app workspace. To learn more about how to copy a report to another workspace, go to [Copy reports from other workspaces](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-copy-reports).

## Updating a Power BI app

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are available as template app on AppSource. When a new version of a template app becomes available, we notify you in two ways:

- An update banner displays in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] informing you that a new version is available.
- A notification displays in Power BI's notification pane.

When you update a template app, it's important that you're aware of your options and how they might overwrite earlier changes to the reports. You can choose to:

- Update the workspace and the app.
- Update workspace content only, without updating the app.
- Install another copy of the app in a new workspace.

To learn more, go to [Install, share, and update template apps in your organization](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-install-distribute#update-a-template-app).

# Tell Me FAQ

This article answers questions that our advanced users often ask about the Tell me what you want to do feature.

## Are all actions from my current page discoverable in Tell Me?

No. Actions in parts, such as the Sales Lines part or FactBoxes, aren't displayed in Tell Me.

## Can I search for a specific record?

Yes. For example, if you want to quickly find a sales order, enter it's identifier, and then choose the **Search company data** action. If you only know the customer's name, enter that. Tell Me arranges results by type, so you could find the order under the Sales Orders category.

## Are the results in Tell Me filtered by permissions?

If the user doesn't have AccessByPermissions, then actions aren't displayed. However, pages and reports appear in the results but require that the user has permission to access them. A message displays if the user doesn't have permission to view the object.

## Does Tell Me display content from my customizations or installed third-party extensions?

Actions, pages, and reports that originate from extensions are picked up by Tell Me. For technical information about how to make custom pages and reports discoverable, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality).

## What makes this different from what was previously known as Page Search?

Page Search has evolved into Tell Me to help you get work done quickly. Page Search could only help you navigate to pages or reports. At a technical level, Tell Me is no longer based on the legacy MenuSuite concept.

## I use on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Does that include Tell Me?

You can use Tell Me in the on-premises Web Client to find actions, pages, and reports, but not apps and consulting services on AppSource.

## Is Tell Me available for all form factors?

Yes. It was introduced on phones and tablets in Business Central 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, it must be enabled in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) using the **Feature: Search for pages and data in the mobile app** switch. In 2024 rlease wave 1 and later, it's always enabled.

<!-- removed in v20 because of Help pane
### Are the documentation results available in any language?
The help articles display in the language you have specified in **My Settings**, if help is available in that language.
-->

## Does Tell Me give me help on how to use pages, reports, and other things?

No, but you can easily get this information from the Help pane. Just select the **Search Help** action in the **Tell me what you want to do** page or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard. To learn more about the Help pane, go to [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane).

### Why don't I see a bookmark icon for my search results?

The bookmark icon isn't displayed in the Tell Me window when personalization is disabled for a user role.

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# Workflows in Business Central

You can set up and use workflows to connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows. System tasks can be preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports these types of workflows:
  
* Power Automate flows

  * Automated flows that are triggered by events (such as record or document creation, modification, or deletion) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also included are approval flows created in Power Automate that trigger when an approval is requested in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  * Instant flows that are manually triggered from the **Automate** action menu on lists, cards, and document pages.

    Create and manually trigger a Power Automate flow on a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, with options to manipulate information both internally and externally (using integrated tools).

* Approval workflows based on built-in workflow templates

  On the **Workflow Templates** page, you can see all available workflows. The trial version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many preconfigured workflows represented by workflow templates you can copy to create new ones. When you open a template from the **Workflow Templates** page, and the workflow name starts with *MS-*, then the template was added by Microsoft.

## Power Automate flows

With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can sign up for Power Automate to build powerful automated workflows. You run those workflows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The flows can connect internal and external data sources and tools, without coding knowledge.

Create an approval workflow by defining what starts the workflow and what happens next, as follows:

* A workflow event, which is moderated by event conditions.
* A workflow response, which is moderated by response options.

To define workflow steps, fill in fields on workflow lines using the event and response values that represent supported scenarios.

Examples of approval workflow events include the creation of sales or purchase orders/quotes/invoices, price changes, vendor or customer edits, and more.

# Flush components according to operation output

You can define different flushing strategies to automate the registration of consumption of components.

This feature is useful for the following reasons:  

- **Inventory Valuation**

    Value entries for output and consumption are created in parallel as the production order progresses. Without routing link codes, the inventory value increases as output is posted and decreases later when you post the consumption with the finished production order.  
- **Inventory Availability**

    With gradual consumption posting, the availability of component items is more up-to-date, which is important to maintain the internal balance between demand and supply. Without routing link codes, other demands for the component might believe that it's available as long as it's pending a delayed consumption posting.  
- **Just-in-Time**

    With the ability to customize products to customer requests, you can minimize waste by making sure that work and system changes only occur when it's necessary.  

- **Reduce data entry**

    The ability to automatically flush an operation lets you automate the entire process of recording consumption and output. The disadvantage of using automatic flushing is that you might not accurately record, or even be aware of, scrap.

## Automatic consumption posting (flushing) methods  

- Forward Flush the Entire Order  
- Forward Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing the Entire Order  

### Forward flush an entire order  

Forward flushing a production order at the start of the job is similar to a manual consumption. The significant difference is that consumption happens automatically.  

- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed.  
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM, multiplied by the number of parent items you're building.  
- There's no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed.  
- When you consume items from inventory, it doesn't matter when output journal entries are made because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting.  
- No routing link codes can be set.  

Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with:  

- A low number of defects.  
- A low number of operations.  
- High component consumption in early operations.  

### Forward flushing by operation  

Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item. Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes, which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM.  

The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started. Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation. And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered.  

The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items you're building (expected quantity).  

This technique is best employed when there are many operations and certain components aren't needed until late in the assembly sequence. In fact, a Just-in-Time (JIT) setup might not even have the items on hand when the RPO is begun.  

Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes. Some components might not be used until final assembly operations and shouldn't be withdrawn from stock until that time.  

### Back flushing by operation  

Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal.  

The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known.  

Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes. The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity.  

The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items posted as output for the operation. This quantity might be different than the expected quantity.  

### Back flushing an entire order  

This reporting method doesn't consider routing link codes.  

No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to *Finished*. The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that you finished and put in inventory.  

Backward flushing the entire production order requires the same setup as for forward flushing: The reporting method must be set to backward on each item card for all items within the parent BOM to be reported. In addition, all routing link codes must be removed from the production BOM. 

For example, if a production order to produce 800 meters requires 8 kg of a component, then when you post 200 meters as output, 2 kg are automatically posted as consumption.

You can achieve that by combining backward flushing method and routing link codes so that the quantity that is flushed for each operation is proportional to the actual output of the finished operation. For items that are set up with backward flushing method, the default behavior is to calculate and post component consumption when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. If you also define routing link codes, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished, and the quantity that was consumed in the operation is posted. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## To flush components according to operation output

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Flushing Method** field, select **Backward**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Select **Pick + Backward** if the component is used in a location that is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Define routing link codes for every operation that consumes the component. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Don't use the same routing link for different operations in the routing. Using the same routing link would lead to registration of consumption of component for each linked operation.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Define routing link codes from each instance of the component to the operation that consumes it.

The consumption is posted automatically when you register output. To learn more, go to [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).

## Flushing methods

The following table describes the flushing method options that you can specify on **Item** cards and **Stockkeeping Unit** cards.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-------------|  
|Manual|You can manually consume items without picking. For each item, stockkeeping unit, or production order component line you can ignore the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** setting in the **Location Card** page. Skipping warehouse or inventory picks is typical for automatic flushing methods, such as **Backward** and **Forward**. It might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, they might require manual posting of consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can very or they require item tracking.<br><br>To start using this feature, on the **Feature Management** page, activate **Feature Update: 'Manual' flushing method without requiring pick**. Existing records upgrade from **Manual** to the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. The **Pick + Manual** option is added immediately and works, regardless of whether you enable the feature key. If the feature isn't enabled, **Manual** and **Pick + Manual** both require picking due to the original behavior. When the feature key is enabled, the **Manual** option doesn't require picking.|
|Forward|Automatically posts consumption according to the production order component lines. <br><br>By default, the posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a production order to **Released**. However, if you use the **Routing Link** Code field on production order component lines, then posting occurs per operation when the operation starts. For more information, see [How to: Create Routing Links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links). <br><br> **Note**<br>For the forward flushing option, the operation-specific posting that you get with routing link codes is based on the expected quantity that is defined on the component line. For information about operation-specific flushing based on actual output, see the description of **Backward** in this article.<br><br>If the location or resources where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md). <br><br> **Important** <br>Forward flushing also occurs when you choose **Refresh** on a released production order that was created from scratch. On the released production orders, you can't change bin information because you generate the production order component lines when you refresh the order. Refreshing the order forward flushes the components. Therefore, if you want to change bin information on production order component lines before forward flushing occurs, then that order must be created with the *Planned* or *Firm Planned* status.|
|Backward|Automatically calculates and posts consumption according to the production order component lines.<br><br> By default, the calculation and posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. However, if you use the **Routing Link Code** field on the production order component lines, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished.<br><br> **Note** <br>Backward flushing and routing link codes can be combined so that the quantity that is flushed per operation is proportional to the actual output of that operation. For more information, see [How to: Flush Components According to Operation Output](#to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output).<br><br> If the location or machine center where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**.|
|Pick + Forward|Same as for Forward flushing method, except it only works for locations that use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.<br><br> **Note** <br>If a component uses the Pick + Forward flushing method, it can't have a routing link code to an operation that uses the forward flushing method. The component would then be automatically flushed when the operation starts, which makes it impossible to request the pick activity.|
|Pick + Backward|Same as for Backward flushing method, except it only works for locations use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.|
|Pick + Manual|Require picking if consumption needs to happen at a location where warehouse handling is enabled.|

# Set up work hours and service hours

Typically, a service management system tracks resource hours and service order status in order to forecast workloads and service needs. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in tools that you can customize to record this kind of information.  
  
After you set the default service hours of your company, you can calculate response times for service orders or send warnings or alerts when service calls come in. The alert feature is implemented together with the job scheduler.
  
As you work on a service order, update its status so that you can monitor progress. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order. For more information, see [Understanding Service Order and Repair Status](service-order-repair-status.md).

## To set up default service hours

You use the **Default Service Hours** page to set up the usual service working hours in your company. These service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes and to send response time warnings. The default service hours are used for service contracts unless you specify special service hours for a contract.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Service Hours**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you leave the lines on the **Default Service Hours** page empty, the default value is 24 hours, valid only for calendar working days.  
  
## To set up work hour templates

You can use the **Work Hour Template** page to set up templates that contain the working hours for different types of resources in your company. For example, you can create templates for full time technicians and part time technicians. You use work hour templates when you set capacity for resources. To learn more about setting capacity for a resource, go to [To set capacity for a resource](projects-how-setup-resources.md#to-set-capacity-for-a-resource).
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Hour Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!Note]
> After you enter work hours for each day, the value in the **Total per Week** field is calculated automatically.  

## To set up contract specific service hours

You can use the **Service Hours** page to set up specific service hours for the customer that owns the service contract. Service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes that belong to the service contract.  
  
If you don't set up specific service hours for the service contract, the default service hours for service contracts are used.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract you want to set up specific service hours for, and choose **Service Hours**.  
4. To set up service hours based on default service hours, choose the **Copy Default Service Hours** action.  
5. Edit the fields in the service hours entries. Insert or delete entries to set up the service hours for the contract. The fields **Day**, **Starting Time** and **Ending Time** are required for each line.  
6. If you want the service hours to be valid from a specific date, fill in the **Starting Date** field.  
7. If you want the service hours to be valid on holidays, select the check box in the **Valid on Holidays** field.

# Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger

This article explains how to manage the chart of sustainability accounts (CoSA), categories and subcategories, and details about sustainability ledger entries.

## Chart of sustainability accounts

The CoSA forms the foundational structured list that is used to record all emissions, water, and waste data. It serves as a framework that categorizes and organizes sustainability accounts based on their attributes, such as the scope or other groupings. Each account is typically assigned a unique code or number for easy reference and tracking. It has the same structure as a traditional chart of accounts but is customized specifically to monitor sustainability-related data and metrics in an organization.  

Users can add sustainability account categories and sustainability account subcategories to define how the system behaves. In this way, they can select dedicated emissions, water, or waste for tracking, emission factors, formulas, and similar configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, there are three emission scopes:
>
> - **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
> - **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
> - **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.
> - **Out of scope** is for situations where you can't assign a specific emission to the transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select **Water/Waste** as one of options in the **Emission Scope** when they want to post transactions related to the water and waste management.  

From the CoSA, you can do things such as:

- View reports that show sustainability ledger entries and balances.
- Open the sustainability account card to add or change settings.
- View the category and subcategory for the account.
- View separate balances for each emission for a single account.
- Add single or multiple dimensions to each account and set dimension filters.

You can add, change, or delete sustainability accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

### Add or change accounts

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Sustainability Accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Chart of Sustainability Accounts** page, you can open each sustainability account, and then add or change settings. Hover over a field to read a short description.

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must set the **Totaling** field.

For accounts of the **End-Total** type, the **Indent** action automatically sets the **Totaling** field. After you set up all the accounts, select the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action to run the **Indent** action and set the **Totaling** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action overwrites the value of all fields for **End-Total** accounts. Therefore, if you entered definitions in the **Totaling** field for **End-Total** accounts before you ran the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action, you must enter them again after you run it.  

### Delete accounts

You can delete a sustainability account. However, you must first make sure that no ledger entries are associated with it. Business Central prevents you from deleting a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

## Account categories

You must add a sustainability account category to each sustainability account to define how the system behaves. You can select emission scopes (gas, water, or waste), dedicated to type of transaction to track, formulas, and similar configurations.  

To review sustainability account categories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Categories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Categories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. In the **Emission Scope** field, select one of the scope options related to gas emissions or water or waste intensity.
5. Select the gas emissions, or water or waste intensity, that you want to track. Currently, the following options are available: **CO2**, **CH4**, **N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity**. You can select any combination that you want to track, but you must select at least one of them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose one of gas emissions scopes as the **Emission Scope** you can select the **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**, but you can't select the **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**. Also, if you select **Water/Waste** as the **Emission Scope**, you can select only the  **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**, but you can't select **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**.

6. In the **Calculation Foundation** field, select the calculation foundation (formula) to use for emission calculations if you don't know the accurate emission or water or waste intensity amount.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the formulas in the **Calculation Foundation** field aren't enough, you can extend the field and add more calculations for use in sustainability journals.

7. If you selected **Custom** in the **Calculation Foundation** field, you can configure a custom description in the **Custom Value** field.

If you set the **Calculation Foundation** field, the following table explains how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates emissions based on the option that you selected. In the table, **EF** represents the **Emission Factor** value that you can configure on the **Sustainability Account Subcategory** page.

| Emission Type | Calculation Foundation | Formula | Comment |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Scope 1** | | | |
| Stationary combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for boilers, heaters, thermal oxidizers, and so on. |
| Mobile combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| | | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| Fugitive emissions | Installation | *Emission* = *Installation multiplier* &times; *Custom Amount* &divide; 100 &times; *Time Factor* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Assembly losses, annual leak rate, and so on. |
| **Scope 2** | | | |
| Utility providers | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Electricity* &times; *EF* | *Fuel/Electricity* = Electricity quantity, steam quantity, heating unit, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Thermal unit, ton-hour, and so on. |
| **Scope 3** | | | |
| Purchased goods and services, and capital goods | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Cost (GL), and so on. |
| Upstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Downstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Waste generated in operations and end-of-life treatment of sold products | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Waste |
| Business travel and employee commuting | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of the used company car, rental car, train, flight, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Hotel stays |
| | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel spent in the company car, rental car, and so on. This is the only formula used for water or waste intensity calculation. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note applies to the formulas for **Upstream Transportation and Distribution** and **Downstream Transportation and Distribution** when you use the tons-of-cargo calculation model. While you can adapt the formulas, we recommend against using the exact number of tons of cargo as a multiplier. Instead, consult your sustainability advisor to ensure accurate calculations because emissions don't increase linearly with weight. A more accurate approach is to use the **Load Factor**, which represents the percentage of the truck's total capacity utilized (by weight or volume). The load factor can be calculated as **Weight of Cargo** / **Maximum Load Capacity of Truck**. But always confirm with your sustainability expert before you finalize calculations.

## Account subcategories

You must add a sustainability account subcategory to each sustainability account. This subcategory defines the emission factors that the formulas use, based on the emission tracking choice in the sustainability account category.

To review sustainability account subcategories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Subcategories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Subcategories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. Based on the gas emissions that you track in the sustainability account category and connect this subcategory to, you can also set one or more emission factors:

    - **Emission Factor CO2** – The emission factor for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor CH4** – The emission factor for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor N2O** – The emission factor for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission.
    - **Water Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Water.
    - **Discharged Into Water Factor** - The intensity factor for Discharged Into Water.
    - **Waste Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Waste.

5. If the subcategory is related to renewable energy, select the **Renewable Energy** field. However, you can select this field only if it's related to gas emissions and to water or waste.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Import Data** and **Import From** fields are intended for integration with external systems that are used to collect emission factors. However, in **2024 release wave 1**, these fields can't be used as a feature by default.

You can have more than one account subcategory for a sustainability account, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting.  

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you want to use one account for cars, but you have different types of cars with different emission factors. You can set up one account and create account subcategories for the different emission factors. When you work in a sustainability journal, you can change your account subcategory based on the car type.  

## Sustainability ledger entries

The sustainability ledger stores the history of all posted sustainability transactions and organizes all emission data according to the CoSA. When you post a sustainability journal, the data is recorded there. All active reports are generated based on the sustainability ledger entries.

To open this ledger for a specific account, use the **Ledger Entries** action on the **Chart of Sustainability Account** page. To open all the ledger entries, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, and then select the related link. Hover over a field to read a short description.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you post your data to the sustainability ledger, you can't delete it. If you made a mistake, you can post a reverse transaction that has the same details but uses the negative sign for the amount.

> [!NOTE]
> If you posted entries before enabling **CO<sub>2</sub>e** in the **Emission Fees** page, you can run the **Update Carbon Fees** action from the **Emission Fees** page to recalculate carbon equivalent to in all transactions in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

# Create Production Orders from Sales Orders

You can create production orders for produced items directly from sales orders.  

## To create a production order from a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the sales order you want to create a production order for.  
3. Choose the **Planning** action. The **Sales Order Planning** page shows the availability of the item.  
4. Choose the **Create Prod. Order** action.  
5. Select the status and order type.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to create one or more production orders for the lines that have **Prod. Order** in their **Replenishment System** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Demand lines that have **Prod. Order** in the **Replenishment System** field represent underlying production orders. After you generate these production orders, remember to identify any unfulfilled component demand for them. Use the **Order Planning** page or the **Replan** action to identify unfulfilled demand.
    >
    > When you create production orders for sales orders with the Sales Order Planning page, order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply. When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't include linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. To learn more about balancing, go to [Order-to-order links](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#order-to-order-links).

## Order type  

The following table describes two ways to create production orders.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Item Order|One production order is created for each item represented by a line in the **Sales Order Planning** page.|
|Project Order|One multiline production order is created for all items represented by lines on the **Sales Order Planning** page. When you use project orders, the **Source Type** field of the production order contains **Sales Header**. The order has one line for each sales line item that must be produced.|

# Switching to Another Company or Environment

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many different countries/regions and supports many different types of organizations. Your organization may choose to organize work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into multiple *companies* and *environments*. This article helps you understand the key differences and how to work across them.

## About companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you often switch between companies, or work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from within another app like Microsoft Teams, it can be easy to lose track of where you are. To help you keeping track, you can add a badge that will display the company name, so you can quickly verify that you're in the right place. For more information, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).
> 
> Depending on your browser, you can also pin the different companies to your favorites bar.  

<!--
[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]-->

## Features for switching company or environment

There are a few features you can use to switch the company or environment as you work. The following table compares the capabilities of the feature, which are explained in more detail in the sections that follow.

|Feature|Switch company|Switch environment|Switch in new browser tab| Available on-premises|
|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|[Company switcher](#use-the-company-switcher)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|[App launcher](#use-the-app-launcher)||![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")||
|[My Settings](#use-my-settings)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|||![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|[Company Hub](#use-company-hub)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")||

## Use the company switcher

Using the company switcher is probably the quickest and most versatile way to switch company. The company switcher is a pane that's readily available from any page. The pane gives an overview of all companies in all environments that you have access to, and lets you switch directly to any one of them&mdash;either in the same browser tab or a new one. It's especially useful when you work in many companies across different environments.

1. In upper-right corner, near the search icon, you'll see either the standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments"), or a [custom badge](admin-company-information.md#badge) for the company you're currently working with. Select the icon to open the company switcher pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/company-switch-2.png" alt-text="Shows the company switcher icon in the heading of the Business Central client.":::  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also use the <kbd>Crtl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> keyboard shortcut to open the pane.
2. In the **Available Companies** pane, select the company that you want to switch to, select the **Switch** arrow, then choose one of the following options:

   |Option|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |Switch|Opens the role center for selected company in the same browser tab that you're working in. The company becomes the default company that opens in Business Central, until you switch again or change the company by using **My Settings**. |
   |Open in new tab|Opens the role center for selected company in a new browser tab, keeping the original company open in the other tab.|
   |Open in new tab and go to same page|This option is only active on list pages, like customers, sales orders, or items. It opens the same list, but for the selected company, in a new browser tab. |

> [!TIP]
> Select <kbd>F5</kbd> to refresh list of environments and companies.

## Use the app launcher

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the environments that you can access are available on the Microsoft 365.  

1. Select the **App Launcher** icon ![App Launcher.](media/app-launcher-icon.png "The App Launcher provides access to more features").
2. In the pane that opens, look for and choose [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you don't see [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **All apps**, then enter **Business Central** in the **Search** box.

   :::image type="content" source="media/app-launcher-bc-tile.png" alt-text="The Microsoft 365 app launcher showing the Business Central tile.":::  

3. If there's more than one environment, you'll be asked to choose the environment to access.

> [!NOTE]
> App launcher isn't available if you're signed in to Business Central as a guest.

<!--
The following image shows tiles for accessing production and sandbox environments on the Dynamics 365 Home page.

:::image type="content" source="media/app-picker-environments.png" alt-text="The Dynamics 365 Home page showing production and sandbox environments.":::
-->
## Use My Settings

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can quickly switch to another company in the same environment. After you make the switch, the company you choose becomes your default company and will open the next time you sign in.

1. In the top-right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> keyboard shortcut to quickly open the My Settings page.

2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Company** field, select the company.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!TIP]
> A good way to go directly to your default company when you sign in, and avoid having to specify an environment, is to add the the URL to your list of favorites after you sign in.

## Use company hub

*Company hub* is a highly specialized role center that gives a financial overview across companies and environments. Available as an [extension](ui-extensions-company-hub.md), company hub provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that you have access to. The home page displays financial KPIs and a direct link to the individual environments and companies. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).

# Responsible AI FAQ for Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Chat with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you're interested in general questions about using the feature, see [FAQ for chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot-faq.md).

## What is Chat with Copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you be more creative, productive, and efficient. You can chat with Copilot in Business Central to get answers and insights about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and your business data by typing what you want to know in natural language.

Chat with Copilot, also called chat, is an interactive feature that answers your questions without requiring you to navigate the user interface or the product documentation. The Copilot pane is available from anywhere in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.

You can ask questions in natural language, like "How do I deliver goods to my customers directly from my vendors?" or "Do we have any office chairs in stock for under $600?" In response, Copilot provides answers in natural language. Depending on the questions, answers can include plain text, links to records or pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and links to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] help articles on Microsoft Learn.

## What are the capabilities of Chat with Copilot?

You can chat with Copilot to get answers to the following classes of questions:

### Explain and guide

You can ask Copilot to explain a specific concept related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like what are dimensions, or provide guidance on how to complete a task, like how to post a sales order. Copilot searches the official [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation published by Microsoft, and provides an answer based on the documentation.

- Copilot uses the knowledge on Microsoft Learn (not a broad web search) to semantically search only Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation on Microsoft Learn. This includes product documentation, release plans, local functionality content, and troubleshooting content.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It simply summarizes any paragraphs it finds on Microsoft Learn that match the question or prompt in chat.

### Find business data and related pages

You can ask Copilot to locate pages by name or request records based on specific fields and constraints. If Copilot finds a match, it responds with a link to the relevant record or page, which you can then select to open. Chat with Copilot works closely with analysis assist to generate data analysis tabs directly from the Chat pane, helping you gain insights into your data. This approach is used whenever you ask questions best illustrated by grouped records or simple calculations, such as totals or averages.

- Copilot converts the natural language input into a query consisting of a table search, sort, and filter criteria.

  The capability uses [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s native data search capabilities to find matching data from tables within the companies database. The search runs under your own identity for security and compliance. It doesn't search outside of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It only summarizes the records received from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] native data search.

## What is the intended use of Chat with Copilot?

Chat is designed for enterprise use and answering questions that relate to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the business data it contains. The feature helps you solve common tasks such as finding records or getting guidance. You can express yourself in your own words, making your work easier and more accessible when working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was Chat with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing during which numerous English language texts covering a broad range of topics and styles of expressing intent were given to Copilot. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.
  
- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

You can provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. 

- You can provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
- We analyze and utilize your feedback on the feature to help us improve responses.
  
- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810).
  
- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of Chat with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the Chat with Copilot limitations when using the system?

- General limitations of AI

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. So, it's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses Copilot before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. For most responses, Copilot also includes citations or reference links that you can use to quickly verify whether Copilot gives a correct answer. For example, when asked how to perform some task, Copilot includes links to the source article. When asked to find a record based on specific criteria, Copilot includes links that describe the list page it identified as the topic of conversation. It also provides information about any filters or sorting that was applied to reach an answer.

- Language limitations

  - [!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

    If you chat with Copilot in a language other than English, Copilot might either respond in the same language, in English, or not at all. While in preview, chat is intended for use with the English language only.

  - The quality of answers can be lower under the following conditions:
    - The language of chat messages to Copilot is something other than en-US.
    - The language setting for the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] differs from the primary language of the data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Specific industry, product, and topic limitations

   Chat includes built-in safety mechanisms that prevent the undesirable generation of harmful content, such as sexually explicit content or incitement of violence. Sometimes, customers operate in industries, sell products and services, or work with processes that naturally overlap with what might be considered inappropriate in other contexts, or work with data that might trigger these safeguards. Chat might not perform as well in these cases.

## What data does Chat with Copilot collect and how is it used

Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational AI models for the benefit of others. Company administrators have full control to govern this data that is part of their Azure subscription. Because administrators or others in your company might have access to this data as determined by your employer, we recommend you don't enter sensitive data such as passwords or other secrets.

## What does Chat with Copilot offer for security

Chat is designed to be secure and executes under the user's identity, inheriting all security permissions and other restrictions and never operating outside of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s platform security. This design means that Copilot can only access data that you have access to.

For users with SUPER permission, chat can more easily locate unsecured data that's typically harder to get to for other users. Organizations that don't apply [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model to restrict which tables and objects each user or user role has access to, might be at elevated risk when using chat. Therefore, we recommend that your organization either implements [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model or deactivates chat.

# Track packages
Most shipping agents provide a web service that lets you track the status of your packages while they're en route. That information can be useful in many business processes, for example, when providing customer service. If you use one or more shipping agents, you can enter some basic information about them, and then use their package tracking service directly from the Posted Sales Shipments, Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages. For more information, see [Set Up Shipping Agents](sales-how-to-set-up-shipping-agents.md). 

The following procedure shows how to track a package from a posted sales shipment, but the same steps apply to enable package tracking from the Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, and Posted Return Receipt pages.  

## To track a package

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure uses the Posted Sales Shipment page as an example. The steps to track a package are the same on the Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the shipment you want to track, and then choose the **Update Document** action.
3. In the **Package Tracking No.** field, enter the package number you received from the shipping agent. 
4. Make sure that the correct shipping agent and the level of service are correct, and then close the page.
5. Choose the **Track Package** action to open the shipping agent's package tracking service.

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning" toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides executives, purchasing managers, and procurement teams with valuable insights into purchasing activities. This app can help you streamline purchasing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize spending by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of purchasing data. Use its reports to increase transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in your daily operations.

## Purchases analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Procurement Officer

### Example scenario: preparing purchasing budgets

As the CEO of a manufacturing company, you need to stay on top of rising raw material costs to maintain profitability. For the leadership team, it's important to understand your organization's spending. The [Purchases Overview](purchases-powerbi-purchases-overview.md) and [Moving Annual Total](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md) reports can give you a better understanding of how much money you spend on purchasing activities and quickly spot increases in raw material costs.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the key metrics on the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png":::

You can also use the [Actual and Budget](purchases-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report to monitor the actual spending against the allocated budget. This comparison helps you make informed decisions to plan ahead for the coming months and years, giving you better budget control.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Actual vs. Budget matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png":::

## Purchases analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: reducing raw material costs

Purchase Managers in manufacturing ensure they have the materials they need to meet production demands. You notice an increase in the cost of a material, which could affect profitability. Using the [Purchases Decomposition](purchases-powerbi-purchases-decomposition.md) and [Purchases by Item](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-item.md) reports, you can quickly identify the vendor that provides the material and analyze the purchase amount compared to the previous year. This information can help you negotiate better prices with the vendor.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Amount by Item Category bar chart" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png":::

To monitor purchasing activities and ensure compliance with weekly or monthly budgets, the [Daily Purchases](purchases-powerbi-daily-purchases.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of purchase amounts. It aggregates amounts by day, week, month, and year. Use this report to spot unexpected spikes in spending and take corrective action before it affects your budget.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png":::

Also, you can use the [Moving Averages](purchases-powerbi-moving-averages.md) report to analyze purchasing trends and identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The **Purchases by Location** report can help you find discrepancies in purchasing patterns across different locations and make decisions.

## Purchases analytics for daily purchasing work

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Agent
- Purchasing Officer

### Example scenario: selecting vendors for purchasing raw materials

As a purchaser for a manufacturing company, you source materials for production. Part of your role is to keep purchasing costs under control to maintain profitability in the allocated budget. Use the **Purchases by Item** report to see the breakdown of purchases by item and category.

You notice that the company spent significantly on a particular category of materials. The purchase amount increased compared to the previous year. You decide to investigate by looking at the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report, which shows the breakdown of purchases by vendor.

You identify that one vendor consistently provided the materials at a higher price than other vendors. To analyze spending and manage your supplier relationship, use the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report. The report shows the purchasing activities for each vendor, including the amount spent, the number of transactions, and the vendors that supplied a specific category of material.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Vendor table" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png":::

# Work with carbon credits  

When you can't reduce your emissions for some reason, you can purchase carbon credits to offset them. By buying carbon credits, you can still emit the equivalent amount of gases but remain carbon neutral. You can purchase carbon credits from specialized providers.  

In general, carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or other greenhouse gases (GHGs). One carbon credit typically represents the right to emit one metric ton of CO₂ or an equivalent amount of another GHG, so it's important for some organizations to enable this option.  

## Set up carbon credits

You set up carbon credits in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as items. A credit can be an inventory, service, or non-inventory type of item.

To set up an item as a carbon credit, follow these steps:
  
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new item. To learn more about how to create an item, go to [Register new items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, turn on the **GHG Credit** toggle.
4. In the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field, enter the value of the carbon credit.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field represents the amount of CO₂ in the unit of measure configured in the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page. The total value of carbon credit is the amount of credited CO₂ per one **Base Unit of Measure** of the item.

## Purchase carbon credits

### Purchase documents

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow the steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   1. Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   2. Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab. To learn more, go to [How to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the item configured as a carbon credit in the **No.** field on a line. Then fill in the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields.
4. In the **Sustainability Account No.** field, choose the account to use for decreasing your carbon dioxide (CO₂) value. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Emission CO2** field based on the value you configured in the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field on the **Item** card.
5. Post the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Although carbon credits decrease the value of entries, the **Emission CO2** field shows a positive amount. After you post the document, on the **Sustainability Ledger Entry** page, the entries have negative values and the **Document Type** field shows **GHG Credit**.  

### Sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you intend to post in the same batch.  
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **GHG Credit**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory. Choose the account to which you post carbon credits.
5. Select the **Manual Input** checkbox, and then enter the value you want to post as a carbon credit to the **Emission CO2** field.  
6. Post the journal.

# Work Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Work Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each work center. Use this report to ensure that work centers aren't overloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Work Center Load Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on work centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded work centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular work center. Additionally, by monitoring the work center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a work center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for work center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all work centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Work Center Load* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

# Sales Order Agent overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Order Agent helps Business Central users automate capturing sales orders. The agent uses AI to analyze customer requests received via email, locate the customer in Business Central, and engage in multi-turn email conversations to clarify requests if important details are missing or more choices are available. It also checks and informs the customer about the availability of the items they're looking for and follows up with a sales quote. The quote is formatted as a PDF and includes the requested items, quantities, units of measure, prices, taxes, requested delivery dates, provided external document reference, and other important details.

> [!TIP]
> Watch a short video in the Dynamics Business Central channel on YouTube at [Get started with the Sales Order Agent for Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6icbmbLc_Og).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->
## Functionality

### Activation and configuration

The agent is readily available in the product. To activate it, you specify the email inbox you want the agent to monitor. Additionally, specify your preferences for certain aspects of the agent's behavior and designate the users authorized to use the agent to process customers' orders, enabling the agent to act on behalf of a company, department, or team&mdash;not just an individual user.

### Permissions and profiles

The agent operates within the permissions and profile (role) assigned to it by the administrator. Permissions define which areas of the product (tables) the agent has access to. The profile outlines the UX elements (pages and actions) the agent can engage with during its work. Default permissions and the profile are assigned to the agent out of the box; however, administrators can update these permissions as needed.

### Operation

The Sales Order Agent is designed to run autonomously in the background, using AI to perform its tasks while keeping users informed about key steps and involving them when necessary. Involvement might be needed in specific scenarios, for instance to review outgoing messages or to provide missing details, based on configured preferences.

Conceptually, the agent interacts with Business Central functionality in a manner similar to how Business Central users interact with it. The agent is provided with general instructions, expressed in natural language, outlining how the process of capturing sales orders should be handled. It then uses UI metadata, such as captions, tooltips, and other properties, combined with the data presented on Business Central pages and its own instructions, to determine each step required to complete the task. Starting from the designated Role Center, the agent navigates the pages, invokes UI actions, and enters data as a user would. This approach allows a high degree of flexibility and adaptability for the agent to achieve its goal because the agent’s interaction surface and steps aren’t hardcoded. Instead, AI determines them based on the context of each step.

This flexibility enables the agent to discover and interact with relevant custom fields and actions. It can also attempt to automatically resolve validation errors by processing displayed error messages and adjusting the input accordingly.

### Email monitoring and communications

The agent relies on an internal email dispatcher running as a background task to continuously monitor a designated mailbox for item requests. The dispatcher triggers the agent to perform tasks and subsequently sends results, such as prepared sales quotes or orders, to the customer in response.

The agent helps with composing email bodies based on the context of the current step. For instance, it can list available inventory or provide a brief description of the attached sales quote or sales order. Additionally, it can detect and flag irrelevant or potentially malicious email content, prompting users to review and decide how to proceed.  

### Customer and Business Central user involvement

Users can inspect the agent's steps and the created sales documents. They can easily identify the data entered by the agent compared to data generated by Business Central's own business logic and provide more input if needed, such as adding discounts or updating shipping costs.

If the customer decides to update the quote by sending another email listing required changes, the agent assists with these changes by locating the quote and making the requested updates. Once the customer confirms the quote's accuracy, the agent converts it into a sales order, which is then also shared with the customer via email, following user's confirmation. 

The agent always involves designated Business Central users to review and approve all outgoing messages, before they're sent to the customers.

## How the agent processes requests

The agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. The mailbox is specified in the Sales Order Agent configuration (learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md)). When the agent identifies a potential request in an email, it starts to prepare a sales quote. For example, it verifies whether the customer is registered in Business Central. It then checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer that includes the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, like reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles back-and-forth email exchanges with the customer to resolve missing details and allow modifications to the original request. Learn more in [Agent process flow](#agent-process-flow).

### Identifying customers/contacts and related documents

The agent ensures that a request from one customer can't be about another customer's requests. When the agent processes a request, it first identifies the customer in Business Central using the sender's email address. The agent searches for the email among the registered Business Central contacts, sales quotes and orders, and then looks up the customer linked to that email:

- If a customer is found, the agent filters to use only sales quotes and orders that belong to the customer.

  This behavior ensures that the agent only creates and updates documents belonging to the customer that sent the email

- If a contact is found but it's not a customer, the agent filters to use only documents belonging to the contact. Quotes can be sent to contacts that aren't registered as a customer.
- If no contact is found, the agent filters out all documents, and it might request user intervention because it can't find the document.

To prevent the agent from requesting intervention and to assist with reviewing incoming messages, the agent verifies whether the contact is registered and displays a notification on the incoming message review page if it isn't. To resolve this issue, you can either register a new contact/customer or update the contact information of an existing contact/customer. The agent generates the notification to indicate that the contact email wasn't found.

### Finding products/items

The agent analyzes incoming emails to detect parameters for preparing a new sales quote or updating an existing one. Apart from the items themselves, parameters might include the item attributes, quantities, units of measure, requested delivery date, external document number, and more. The agent then searches for these items in Business Central's inventory, within a wide range of related tables.

|Table|Fields|
|-|-|
|Items|No.<br>Description<br>Description 2<br>Search Description<br>GTIN<br>Vendor Item Number|
|Item Variant|Code<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Reference|Reference No.<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Attributes|Name<br>Value|
|Item Category| Code<br>Description<br>Parent Category - 1 Level|
|Item Translation|Language<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Identifier|Code|
|Extended text Line|Text|

Although the agent can find products based on vague and incomplete descriptions, its effectiveness is influenced by the quality of product information in Business Central. You can improve the agent's ability to find products by enhancing descriptions, attributes, categories, and extended text of your inventory items.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 15 minutes for newly entered data to become searchable as the system re-indexes the tables in the background.

When it finds the items, the agent checks the items' availability by analyzing multiple parameters, such as required quantity, delivery date, location, scheduled and planned receipts and more.

## Agent process flow

### Partcipants

Processing a sales quote request into an order involves three participants:

- Customer who requests a sales quote via email.

    Here's an example of an email:

    > Hello,
    >
    > We are in the process of purchasing furniture for our lodge, and after reviewing your website I would like to request a quote for the following items:
    >
    > - 2 Antwerp tables
    > - 4 Berlin chairs

# Set up email

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

People in businesses send information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email every day. Administrators can connect one or more email accounts to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], letting you send documents without having to open an email app. You can compose each message individually with basic formatting tools, such as fonts, styles, colors, and so on, and add attachments of up to 100 MB. Additionally, report layouts enable administrators to include only the key information from documents. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

Email capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are for outbound messages only. You can't receive replies, that is, there's no "Inbox" page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the email capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only with Exchange Online. We don't support hybrid scenarios, such as connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to an on-premises version of Exchange.
>
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, before you can set up email you must create an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the Azure Portal. The app registration will enable [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to authorize and authenticate with your email provider. Learn more at [Set Up Email for Business Central On-Premises](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-email-for-business-central-on-premises). In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we handle this for you.

## Requirements

There are a couple of requirements for setting up and using the email features.

* To set up email, you must have the **EMAIL SETUP** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).
* Everyone who uses the email features must be a fully licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, delegated admins and guest users can't use the tenant's email account.
* Everyone who uses the email features must have a valid, paid license for Exchange Online. Otherwise, some features won’t work. For example, they can’t send emails because Exchange rejects their messages. You can’t use trial licenses.

## Add email accounts

You add email accounts through extensions that enable accounts from different providers to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The standard extensions let you use accounts from Microsoft Exchange Online. However, other extensions that let you connect accounts from other providers, such as Gmail, might be available.

You can specify predefined business scenarios in which to use an email account to send emails. For example, you can specify that all users send sales documents from one account, and purchase documents from another. Learn more at [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

The following table describes the email extensions that are available by default.

|Extension  |Description  |Examples of when to use  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Microsoft 365 Connector**|Everyone sends email from a shared mailbox in Exchange Online.|When all messages come from the same department, for example, your sales organization sends messages from a sales@cronus.com account. This option requires that you set up a shared mailbox in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Shared mailboxes](/Exchange/collaboration/shared-mailboxes/shared-mailboxes).|
|**Current User Connector**|Everyone sends email from the account they used to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Allow communications from individual accounts.|
|**SMTP Connector**|Use Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) protocol to send emails.|Allow communications through your SMTP mail server. |

The **Microsoft 365 Connector** and **Current User Connector** extensions use the accounts you set up for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center for your Microsoft 365 subscription. To send email using the extensions, users must have a valid license for Exchange Online. Additionally, in sandbox environments, these extensions, including the **Outlook REST API** extension, require that the **Allow HttpClient Requests** setting is enabled. To check whether it's enabled for these extensions, go to the **Extension Management** page, choose the extension, and then choose the **Configure** option.

External users, such as delegated admins and external accountants, can't use these extensions to send email messages from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> If you’re using service-to-service (S2S) authentication, the Microsoft 365 and Current user connectors can’t authenticate the user when they send a sales or purchase document by email. When someone sends a document, the following error message displays:
>
> “You are not authorized to access this resource: https:\//graph.microsoft.com/.default. Contact your system administrator."
>
> The problem is caused by the bound actions on the document APIs that send email. To learn more about the bound actions, go to [Bound Actions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/resources/dynamics_salesinvoice#bound-actions). 
>
> If you want to use S2S authentication and the email features, use the SMTP connector option.

## Use SMTP

If you want to use SMTP protocol to send emails from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the SMTP Connector extension. When you set up an account that uses SMTP, the **Sender Type** field is important. If you choose **Specific User**, emails are sent using the name and other information from the account you're setting up. However, if you choose **Current User**, emails are sent from the email account specified for each user's account. Current User is similar to the Send As feature. For more information, see [Use a Substitute Sender Address on Outbound Email Messages](admin-how-setup-email.md#use-a-substitute-sender-address-on-outbound-email-messages). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Auth 2.0 for SMTP authentication, consider the following:
>
> - All users must be on the same Microsoft Entra tenant.
> - You can't use **Specific User** for the **Sender type**, as you can with Basic authentication. The reason is that OAUTH 2.0 uses the credentials of the current (signed-in) user.
> - For Business Central on-premises, you must create an application registration in the Azure portal, and then run the **Set up Microsoft Entra ID** assisted setup guide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more at [Create an App Registration for Business Central in Azure Portal](admin-how-setup-email.md#create-an-app-registration-for-business-central-in-azure-portal).
>
> Exchange Online is deprecating use of Basic authentication for SMTP. Tenants that are currently using SMTP AUTH won't be affected by this change. However, we strongly recommend using the latest version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and setting up OAuth 2.0 authentication for SMTP. We will not add certificate-based authentication for earlier versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example, version 14. If you can't set up OAuth 2.0 authentication, we encourage you to explore third-party alternatives if you want to use SMTP email in earlier versions.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

## Use the Set Up Email assisted setup guide

The **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide can help you get started quickly with emails.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a default email account, even if you add only one account. The default account will be used for all email scenarios that aren't assigned to an account. Learn more at [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set Up Email Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 


<!--
> [!NOTE]
> If you choose **Other (SMTP)** and are using an account that requires two-factor authentication, the password that you enter in the **Password** field must be the same that you use for your Microsoft 365 subscription, and it must be of type **App Password**. For more information, see [Manage app passwords for two-step verification](/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords). 

is this still true?-->
## Assign email scenarios to email accounts

Email scenarios are processes that involve sending a document. For example, a sales or purchase order or a notification, such as an invitation to an external accountant. Specific email accounts can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can specify that all users always send sales documents from one account, purchase documents from another, and warehouse or production documents from a third account. You can assign, reassign, and remove scenarios whenever you want. A scenario can only be assigned to one email account at a time. The default email account is used for all scenarios that aren't assigned to an account.

On the **Email Scenario Assignment** page, you can choose the **Set Default Attachments** action to add attachments to email scenarios. The attachments will always be available when you compose an email for a document related to the scenario. Each email scenario can have one or more default attachments. Default attachments are automatically added to emails for the email scenario. For example, when you send a sales order by email, the default attachment specified for the Sales Order scenario will be added. Default attachments display in the **Attachments** section at the bottom of the **Compose an Email** page. You can manually add non-default attachments to the email.

<!--
## To set up email
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using an account that requires two-factor authentication, then the password that you enter in the **Password** field must be the same that you use for your Microsoft 365 subscription and it must be of type **App Password**. For more information, see [Manage app passwords for two-step verification](/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords).
3. Alternatively, choose the **Apply Microsoft 365 Server Settings** action to insert any information that is already defined for your Microsoft 365 subscription.
4. When all the fields are correctly filled in, choose the **Test Email Setup** action.
5. When the test succeeds, close the page.

-->

## Set up view policies

You can control the email messages that a user can access in the Email Outbox and Sent Emails pages.

On the **User Email View Policies**, choose a user, and then choose one of the following options in the **Email View Policy** field:

* **View own emails** - The user can view only their own email messages.
* **View all emails** - The user can view all email messages, including emails that were sent by other users.
* **View if access to all related records** - This view policy is used if no other policy is specified. A user can view email messages that other users sent if the user has access to the record that was sent and all of the related records. For example, User A sent a posted sales invoice to a customer. User B can see the email message if they have access to both the invoice and the customer.
* **View if access to any related records** - The user can view email messages that were sent by other people if the user has access to at least one record that is related to the record that was sent. For example, User A sent a posted sales invoice to a customer. User B can see the email message if they have access to either the invoice or the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave the **User ID** field empty and then choose the **Email View Policy** action, the view policy applies to all users.

## Specify how many messages an account can send per minute

Some email providers (ISPs) limit the number of email messages an email account can send in one go, or within a certain amount of time, or both. Known as *email throttling*, the practice helps ISPs control traffic on their servers and prevent spam. If an email account exceeds the limit, the ISP might block the messages. To ensure that the number of messages that you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] complies with your ISP's limit, specify the limit for each of your email accounts.

The default limit for the Microsoft 365 and Current User account types is 30, which matches the limit set by Exchange Online.

There are two ways to specify the limit:

* When you use the Set Up Email assisted setup guide to create a new account, specify the limit in the **Rate limit per minute** field.
* For existing email accounts, specify the limit in the **Email rate limit** field on the account.

## Set up reusable email texts and layouts

You can use reports to include key information from sales, purchase, and service documents in texts for emails. Report layouts define the style and the content of the text in the email. For example, the content might include texts such as a greeting or instructions that precede the document information. This procedure describes how to set up the **Sales - Invoice** report for posted sales invoices, but the process is similar for other reports.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the layout to create content for email messages, you must use the Word file type for your layout.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections - Sales**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Sales** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Invoice**.
3. On a new line, in the **Report ID** field, select, for example, standard report 1306.
4. Select the **Use for Email Body** checkbox.
5. Choose the **Email Body Layout Description** field, and then select a layout from the list.
6. To view or edit the layout that the email text is based on, select the layout on the **Custom Report Layouts** page, and then choose the **Export Layout** action. If you customize the layout, use the **Import Layout** action to upload the new layout.
    > [!NOTE]
    > To customize a standard report layout, such as 1306, you must make a copy of the report. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will help you create a copy when you import a custom layout for a standard report. The name of your new custom report layout will be prefixed with "Copy of."
7. If you want to let customers use a payment service, such as PayPal, you have to set up the service. Afterward, the PayPal information and link are inserted in the email text. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through PayPal](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).
8. Choose the **OK** button.

Now, when you choose, for example, the **Send** action on the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, the email body contains the document information of report 1306 preceded by styled standard text according to the report layout that you selected in step 5.

## Use a substitute sender address on outbound email messages

If you're using the SMTP Connector extension, you can use the **Send As** or **Send on Behalf** capabilities from Microsoft Exchange to change the sender address on outbound messages. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the SMTP account to authenticate to Exchange, but will either replace the sender address with the one you specify, or amend it with "on behalf of."

When you set up an account and you want to use the Send As or Send on Behalf capabilities from Exchange, in the **Sender Type** field, choose **Specific User**.

Alternatively, you can choose **Current User** to allow people to send messages through the SMTP Connector. The message will appear to be sent from the email account specified in the Contact Email field on the User Card for the user they're signed in as. However, it will function similar to the Send As feature and will be sent from the account specified in the setup of the SMTP Connector.

The following are examples of how Send As and Send on Behalf are used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* You might want the purchase or sales orders that you send to vendors and customers to appear to come from a _noreply@yourcompanyname.com_ address.
* When your workflow sends an approval request by email using the email address of the requester.

> [!Note]
> You can only use one account to substitute sender addresses. That is, you cannot have one substitute address for purchasing processes, and another for sales processes.

<!--
### To set up the substitute sender address for all outbound email messages
1. In the **Exchange admin center** for your Microsoft 365 account, find the mailbox to use as the substitute address, and then copy or make a note of the address. If you need a new address, go to your Microsoft 365 admin center to create a new user and set up their mailbox.
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
3. In the **Send As** field, enter the substitute address.
4. Copy or make a note of the address in the **User ID** field.
5. In the **Exchange admin center**, find the mailbox to use as the substitute address, and then enter the address from the **User ID** field in the **Send As** field. For more information, see [Use the EAC to assign permissions to individual mailboxes](/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-permissions?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true#use-the-eac-to-assign-permissions-to-individual-mailboxes).

### To use the substitute address in approval workflows
1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Copy or make a note of the address in the **User ID** field.
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. In the **Exchange admin center**, find the mailboxes for each user listed in the **Approval User Setup** page, and in the **Send As** field enter the address from the **User ID** field of the **SMTP Email Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Manage permissions for recipients](/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-permissions?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).
5. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
6. To enable substitution, turn on the **Allow Sender Substitution** toggle.

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will determine which address to display in the following order: <br><br> 1. The address specified in the **E-Mail** field on the **Approval User Setup** page for messages in a workflow. <br> 2. The address specified in the **Send As** field in the **SMTP Email Setup** page. <br> 3. The address specified in the **User ID** field in the **SMTP Email Setup** page. -->

## Set up document sending profiles

You can save time by setting up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each of your customers. You won't have to select a sending option, such as whether to send the document by email or as an electronic document, every time you send a document. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

## Optional: Set up email logging in Exchange Online

Get more out of the communications between salespeople and your existing or potential customers. You can track email exchanges, and then turn them into actionable opportunities. Learn more at [Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts](marketing-set-up-email-logging.md).  
<!--
[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online. For more information, see [Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts](marketing-set-up-email-logging.md).  -->

## Optional: Monitor email usage and troubleshoot email failures with telemetry

Administrators can switch on the telemetry feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to get data about usage and failures of different capabilities. For email, we log the following operations:

* An email was sent successfully  
* An attempt to send an email failed
* Authentication to an SMTP server succeded/failed  
* Connection to an SMTP server succeded/failed  

Learn more at [Analyzing Email Telemetry (administration content)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-email-trace).  

## Set up email for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can integrate with services that are based on Microsoft Azure. For example, you can use Cortana Intelligence for smarter cash flow forecasts, Power BI to visualize your business, and Exchange Online for sending email. Integration with these services is based on an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services for communications. To use the email capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you must register [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as an app in the Azure portal, and then connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the app registration. The following sections describe how.

### Create an app registration for Business Central in Azure portal

The steps to register [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Azure portal are described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the email features, your app registration must use a multi-tenant configuration.

The settings that are specific to the email capabilities are the delegated permissions that you grant to your app registration. The following table lists the minimum permissions.

|API / Permission Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Graph/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.ReadWrite |Delegated|Compose email messages.         |
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.Send|Delegated|Send email messages.         |
|Microsoft Graph/offline_access|Delegated|Maintain data access consent.|
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.Send.Shared|Delegated|Shared Mailbox|

If you're using the SMTP Connector and want to use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, the permissions are slightly different. The following table lists the permissions.

|API / Permission Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Graph/offline_access|Delegated|Maintain data access consent.|
|Microsoft Graph/openid|Delegated|Sign users in.|
|Microsoft Graph/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |
|Microsoft Graph/SMTP.Send|Delegated|Send emails from mailboxes using SMTP AUTH.         |
|Office 365 Exchange Online/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |

When you create your app registration, note the following information. You'll need it to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration.

* Application (client) ID
* Redirect URI (optional)
* Client secret

Learn more about general guidelines for registering an app at [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

> [!NOTE]
If you have trouble using the SMTP protocol to send email after you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration, it might be because SMTP AUTH is not enabled for your tenant. We recommend that you use the Microsoft 365 and Current User email connectors instead, because they use Microsoft Graph Mail APIs. However, if you must use SMTP protocol you can enable SMTP AUTH. For more information, see [Enable or disable authenticated client SMTP submission (SMTP AUTH) in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission#disable-smtp-auth-in-your-organization).

### Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration

After you register your application in Azure portal, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Email Microsoft Entra application registration** page to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to it.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Microsoft Entra application registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Handle vendor payment disputes

You can mark a vendor ledger entry as **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document. The on hold status helps you maintain transparency and efficiency while you manage and resolve the issue.

## To set a vendor ledger entry on hold

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor ledger entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to mark.
3. Choose **Edit List**. You can now enter up to 3 characters (likely your initials) in the **On Hold** field to indicate the document is on hold. 

## On hold entries, and the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job

The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [Suggest vendor payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).


## Analyzing On hold vendor ledger entries 

There are multiple other options for analyzing entries on hold. 

For instance, on the **Vendor ledger entries** page you can set a filter on the **On Hold** field to this value
``` Filter
<>''
```


You can also take the vendor ledger entries list page into analysis mode and define an analysis tab. To learn more, go to
[Using data analysis to show vendor ledger entries on hold](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold)


Or you can run the [Payments on Hold](reports/report-319.md) report.

## Block vendors

You can also block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor for purchase documents, or so that they can't post payments to the vendor.

To learn more, go to [Block vendors](payables-how-block-vendors.md).

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# Responsible AI FAQ for autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central, and expert users that are tasked with entering records throughout their entire workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most-Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most-Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central similar to if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. 

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot due to the sensitive nature of that domain.

## What data does Autofill collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to offer the service. 

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your choice to keep or discard a suggestion. It doesn't collect suggested field values or other company data used by Copilot to provide suggestions.
- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Create workflows from workflow templates

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by creating a series of workflow steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event (When Event), moderated by event conditions (On Condition), and a workflow response (Then Response), moderated by response options. The fields on workflow lines provide fixed lists of event and response values that represent the scenarios that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

To save you time when you create approval workflows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides workflow templates. The templates are available on the **Workflow Templates** page. You can use the templates as they are, or customize them to meet your needs. The codes for the workflow templates from Microsoft are prefixed with **MS-**.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-next-step](includes/workflow-next-step.md)]

If you change a workflow template, but later regret the change, use the **Reset Microsoft Templates** action to revert to the original setting for the workflow.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Reset Microsoft Templates** action resets all of the Microsoft workflow templates. You can't reset a single template.  

Another way to quickly create a workflow is to import it, for example, if you exported it from another instance of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Export and Import Workflows](across-how-to-export-and-import-workflows.md).  

## To create a workflow from a workflow template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. The **Workflow Templates** page opens.  
3. Select a workflow template, then choose **OK**.  

   The **Workflow** page opens for a new workflow containing all the information of the selected template. The value in the **Code** field is extended with, for example, "-01" to indicate this is the first workflow created from the workflow template.  
4. To customize the workflow, edit the workflow steps or add new steps. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

# About item types

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory. The following table lists and describes the three types of items that are available.

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|Physical things, such as bicycles, telephones, and desks, for which you want to be able to use all inventory processes. Inventory items can also include nonphysical items, such as software licenses and subscriptions, if the items have identification numbers, such as serial numbers. You can fully track item values and availability in inventory.|
|Non-Inventory|Typically, noninventory items are physical things, such as bolts or pens, that your business consumes but doesn't fully track in inventory. For example, because they're low-cost items and only used internally.|
|Service|A labor time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types don't let you track inventory quantities and values. Only selected item transaction types and features are supported. The following table lists the features that the three item types support.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|Order Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

## Costing methods for types of items

When you post inventory transactions, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively.

You record the cost of inventory items in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field on the **Value Entries** page. When you reconcile the entry to the general ledger, the cost shows in the **Cost Posted to G/L** field. To learn more about inventory costing, go to [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

For noninventory and service items, cost is recorded in the **Cost Amount (Non-Invtbl.)** field on the **Value Entries** page. For noninventory and service items, specify cost on sales, assembly, and production documents and journals. Specify the default cost in the **Unit Cost** field on the **Item Card** and **Stockkeeping Unit** pages. Costs for these types of items aren't reconciled to the general ledger.

## Catalog and service items

You can set up items that you offer to your customers but you don't manage in until you sell them as catalog items. Although catalog items are similar to regular items of the type **Non-Inventory** in this respect, don't confuse the two because there are differences. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

Customer items that you service, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalog items. However, service components can be regular items. To learn more, go to [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).

## Resources

In addition to the item type *Item*, sales and purchase documents also allow you to use the item type *Resource*. Like items, resources support dimensions, price lists, and units of measure. <!--With introduction of types *Service* and *Non-Inventory* we do not have any intention to add any extra capabilities for type Resource in purchase and sales processes. We recommend using items of applicable type instead. Resources will continue get new functionality to track the time and effort that is involved with performing and providing services and will stay important part of project and service management. Because many partner solutions use resources, we do not plan to deprecate them in the sales or purchase documents.-->

# FAQ for Suggest Number Series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI effect of the suggest number series feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest number series with Copilot?

Suggest number series can help you create number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language.

* Examples of entities are customers, vendors, and items.
* Examples of documents are quotes, orders, and invoices.

The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use to administrate number series. The feature offers two distinct skills that can help you create new or modify existing number series.

## What are the capabilities of suggest number series?

* Create new number series

   Use natural language to effortlessly set up new number series. Provide examples or masks to define how you envision your setup, and have Copilot draft suggestions for you to build upon.

* Modify existing number series

   Have Copilot help you maintain your existing number series. Extending number series can feel tedious. With Copilot, you can use natural language to modify number series and build upon the suggestions from Copilot.

* Prepare new number series for the next year

   Get ready for the next fiscal year by creating new number series ahead of time.

## What is the intended use of the suggest number series?

The suggest number series capability is intended for system administrators who set up and maintain number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It's a tool to transform requirements written in natural language into the number series structure in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was suggest number series evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest number series? How can users minimize the effect of the limitations when using the system?

The feature works best when you use terminology known to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using alternative terminology might produce results that aren't useful.

* Available geographies

   This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

   [!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted as No. Series.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using suggest number series?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest number series. Even if an administrator enables the feature and it's available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create number series?  

No, the use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to create number series. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time. To learn more, go do [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Use Automated Data Capture Systems (ADCS) foundation

> [!Important]
> The Automated Data Capture System (ADCS) solution provides a way for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to communicate with handheld devices through web services. You must work with a Microsoft partner who can provide the link between the web service and the specific handheld device. 

You can use your automatic data capture system (ADCS) to register the movement of items in the warehouse and to register some journal activities, such as quantity adjustments in the warehouse item journal and physical inventories. ADCS typically involves scanning a barcode.

To use ADCS, you must give each item stored in the warehouse an item identifier. You must also set up miniforms, handheld functions, data exchanges, and specify settings for fields that control ADCS. You specify whether to use ADCS on the location card of a warehouse.

Based on the needs of your warehouse, you define the amount of information displayed in the miniform setup for the particular handheld device. The following are examples of information that you can display:  

- Data from tables within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a list of pick documents from which the user can select.  
- Text information.  
- Messages to show confirmations or errors about activities performed and registered by the handheld device user.

## To enable Web Services for ADCS

To use Automated Data Capture System, you must enable the ADCS web service. You must work with a Microsoft partner who can implement a web service that can connect ADCS and a specific handheld device. You can learn more about the web service for ADCS by examining codeunit 7714. 
 
## To set up a warehouse to use ADCS  

To use ADCS, you must specify which warehouse locations use the technology.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't set up a warehouse to use ADCS if it also has a bin capacity policy.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the warehouse for which you want to enable ADCS, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, turn on the **Use ADCS** toggle.  

## To specify an item to use ADCS  

Each warehouse item that you want to use with ADCS must be assigned an identifier code to link it with its item number. For example, you can use the item's bar code as the identifier code. An item can also have multiple identifier codes. You may find this useful in the case where an item is available in various units of measures, such as pieces and pallets. In this case, assign an identifier code to each.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item from the list that is part of your ADCS solution, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Identifiers** action.
4. On the **Item Identifiers** page, choose the **New** action.
5. In the **Code** field, specify the identifier for the item. For example, the identifier could be the item's bar code number.  

    You can also enter a **Variant Code** and a **Unit of Measure** code.  

6. If needed, enter multiple codes for each item.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. To review the information, choose the **Identifier Code** field to open the **Item Identifiers** page.

## To add an ADCS user  

You can add any user to an ADCS. When you do, the user must provide a password. Optionally, you can also provide a connection that identifies the ADCS user as a warehouse employee. The ADCS user password can be different from their sign-in password. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **ADCS Users**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the user. The name can't have more than 20 characters, including spaces.  
4. In the **Password** field, enter a password.  

### To specify that a warehouse employee is an ADCS user  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. If needed, add a new warehouse employee. Learn more at [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).  
3. Choose the **Edit List** action.  
4. Select a warehouse employee from the list. In the **ADCS User** field, choose the name of an ADCS user from the list.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default warehouse for the employee must be one that uses ADCS.

## To create and customize miniforms

You use miniforms to describe the information that you want to present on a handheld device. For example, you can create miniforms to support the warehouse activity of picking items. After you create a miniform, you can add functions to it for the common actions that a user takes with handheld devices, such as moving up or down a line.  

> [!NOTE]
> To implement or change the functionality of a miniform function, you must create a new codeunit for the **Handling Codeunit** field to perform the required action or response. You can learn more about ADCS functionality by examining the following codeunits:
>
> * 7705
> * 7706
> * 7712
> * 7713  

### To create a miniform for ADCS  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Miniforms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a code for the miniform. Optionally, enter values in all other fields.  

    Turn on the **Start Miniform** toggle to indicate that the miniform is the first form that's available when a user signs in.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, define the fields that appear on the miniform. The order in which you enter lines is the order in which the lines appear on the handheld device.  

When you have created a miniform, the next steps are to create functions and to associate functionality for various keyboard inputs.  

### To customize miniform functions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Miniforms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a miniform from the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Functions** action.  
4. In the **Function Code** drop-down list, select a code to represent the function that you want to associate with the miniform. For example, you can select **ESC** to associate functionality with the **ESC** key.

# Customizing Business Central online using apps

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online by installing apps that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. These apps are also called *extensions* because they *extend* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Manage apps

When you first launch [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some apps are already installed for you. Over time, more apps will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the app or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an app that lets you integrate with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. But, an extension that offers integration with another payment service might come along. In that case, you can install the new extension and then choose which to use.  

To use an app, you must have the permissions to the installed objects.

To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant extensions, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the **D365 Extension Mgt.** user group, or you must have the **EXTEN. MGT. - ADMIN** permission set explicitly. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. Learn more in [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you cannot upload per-tenant extensions or install AppSource apps through the **Extension Management** page. You cannot install AppSource apps on-premises, including in Docker-based deployments.

You manage the apps on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link. Learn more in [Install and Uninstall apps](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you should have access to an app but you cannot find its functionality, check the **Extension Management** page - if the app is not listed there, you can install it as described in the following section.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). Learn more in [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).

If you choose an app, you can read about what the app does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to the terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

When you install an app, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** extension. Other apps add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app, your data is preserved. If you install the app again, it's still available. There are some apps that are required, and you can't uninstall them from the **Extension Management** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can keep an eye out for new apps from Microsoft and other suppliers at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central&page=1).

## Understanding the risks of installing apps

[!INCLUDE [ui-extensions-risk-install-apps](includes/ui-extensions-risk-install-apps.md)]

## Apps and data transfer

When apps communicate with other services, they might transfer data out of the geography of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Examples of such apps include banking, payment, payroll, and forecasting services.

The same is true for the base application, such as the following capabilities:

* Cash Flow Forecast
* Document Exchange Service
* Dataverse connections
* OCR Service
* Online Map
* EU VAT Reg. No. Service

## Connect your business

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. These apps can connect your business to external services that increase productivity by automating processes. For example, you can connect to your banks and automatically import bank transactions. The apps are easy to install and set up directly from this page. Choose an app to learn more about capabilities and pricing.  

View the list of suggested apps by choosing the **Connectivity Apps** action in the **Extension Management** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The first person to open the **Connectivity Apps** page must allow the extension to connect to an external service. Allow the connection once or always. If you choose to block the connection, you must find the relevant apps on AppSource. If you allow the connection once or always, be aware that your information might be shared with third parties. Learn more in the section [Understanding the risks of installing apps](#understanding-the-risks-of-installing-apps).

This external service generates a list of relevant apps based on your country or region

## Recommended apps

Microsoft partners and resellers can create an app that they can use to compile lists of apps that they often recommend to their customers. If they do, and they deployed the app to your tenant, the apps are available on the **Recommended Apps** page. There you can read about each app and decide whether to install them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you're interested in providing a list of recommended apps, see [Recommend Apps from AppSource](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/recommend-apps) in the administration content.

# Close income statement accounts

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it. To do this, you run the **Close Income Statement** batch job. This job transfers the year's result to an account in the balance sheet and closes the income statement accounts. You do this by creating lines in a journal, which you then can post.

## To run the Close Income Statement batch job

1. Close the fiscal year. The fiscal year must closed before the batch job can be run. For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Close Income Statement**, and then choose the related link.
3. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.

## About the Close Income Statement batch job

The batch job processes all general accounts of the income statement type and creates entries that cancel out their respective balances. That is, each entry is the sum of all the general ledger entries on the account in the fiscal year. These new entries are placed in a journal in which you must specify a balancing account and retained earnings account in the balance sheet before you post. When you post the journal, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and at the same time the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

You must post the journal yourself. The batch job doesn't post the entries automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is being used. When an additional reporting currency is being used, the batch job posts entries directly to the general ledger.

The date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the journal is always a closing date for the fiscal year. The closing date is a fictitious date between the last day of the old fiscal year and the first day of the new year. The advantage of posting on a closing date is that you maintain the correct balances for the ordinary dates of the fiscal year.

The **Close Income Statement** batch job can be used several times. You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the batch job again.

# Flows for production, assembly, and projects

Internal flows, such as picking components and putting away end items for assembly, projects, and production orders are similar to inbound or outbound flows. Many of the processes might seem familiar. This article provides information about how to work with internal warehouse flows with various levels of complexity.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important that the options you choose improve your processes without causing overhead. The following tables describe typical configurations for dealing with physical goods for production, projects, and assembly orders.

### Inbound flow (put-away)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Inbound Flow of Production Order|Inbound Flow of Assembly Order|Inbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Output Journal</br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post output using **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|  
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Production Output Whse Handling: Inventory Put-away. </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can still post output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings. |Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order -> Inventory Put-away|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Consolidated put-away activities for multiple source documents.|No dedicated settings|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order(s) -> Output Journal|Assembly order(s) ->  internal movements | Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Same as above plus directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above|Same as above| Put-away isn't applicable for projects|

Some configurations don't let you use dedicated warehouse documents to register put-aways. However, if your location uses bins you can use generic movement documents to move produced or assembled items to warehouse. Learn more at [Moving Items](warehouse-move-items.md).

### Outbound flow (pick)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Outbound Flow of Production Order|Outbound Flow of Assembly Order|Outbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Consumption Journal </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post consumption using a **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Project -> Project Journal|

## Warehouses without dedicated warehouse activity

Even if you don't use dedicated warehouse activities, you might want to track things like consumption and production output. The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents.

* [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
* [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
* [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Basic warehouse configuration

### Flows to and from production in a basic warehouse configuration  

The inbound and outbound flows in a basic warehouse configuration involve the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the inbound flow (put-away), in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick/Movement**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick production components in the flow to production. To put away the products you produce, use **Inventory Put-away** documents.

For locations that use bins, inventory movement documents are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from To-Production or Open Shop Floor bins, go to [Flushing production components in the warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Inventory movements are important documents if you're using **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods. Learn more at [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

* The **To-Production Bin Code**, **From-Production Bin Code**, and **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** fields on the location or the machine/work center define the default flows to and from production areas.
* Manage the movement of produced items on the **Internal Movement** page without a relation to a production order.

### Flows to and from assembly in a basic warehouse configuration  

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Movement**.

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to pick assembly components in the flow to assembly. Post assembly output and consumption directly from an assembly order.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Pick** and **Inventory Put-away** documents aren't supported for assembly orders.

For locations that use bins:

* Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.
* The **To-Assembly Bin Code**, **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card define default flows to and from assembly areas.
* Manage the movement of assembled items on the **Internal Movement** page, without a relation to an assembly order.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order assembly flows. Learn more at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#understanding-assemble-to-order-and-assemble-to-stock). In relation to warehouse management, assemble-to-stock is part of the internal warehouse flow, and assemble-to-order is in the outbound warehouse flow. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Flows for project management in a basic warehouse configuration

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For a location that uses bins, the **To-Project Bin Code** field on the location defines the default flows to project management.

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# The Data Archive Extension

Over time, your business will accumulate a substantial amount of data, and as an administrator, it's probably a good idea to have a strategy for archiving data. Having lots of data can slow things down, for example, it might take slightly longer to generate reports, or even lock records. Additionally, large amounts of data can lead to increased storage costs.

The Data Archive extension provides a basic framework for archiving and backing up data as part of date compression. Date compression consolidates related entries into a single entry and deletes the originals. Learn more at [Compress Data with Date Compression](admin-manage-documents.md#compress-data-with-date-compression). However, there might be value in keeping that data, so rather than deleting it, you can archive it for later use.

## Start Archiving Data

The extension is pre-installed and available on the **Extension Management**, so you don't need to do anything to get started. The extension is also available on AppSource.

Your data archives are listed on the **Data Archive List** page. Each archive can contain data from multiple tables, and can hold up to 10,000 records. If there are more than 10,000 records in a table, a second archive will be created for the next 10,000 records, and so on. For example, if you archive 10,100 G/L entries, Business Central creates one "G/L Entry" archive for the first 10,000 entries, and then a second archive for the remaining 100 entries.

After you archive data, you can explore it using Microsoft Excel or as a CSV file.

* If you use the Excel option, the workbook will contain one worksheet for each data archive table.
* If you use the CSV option, you'll get a ZIP file that contains one CSV file for each data archive table.

> [!TIP]
> The Excel and CSV options make it easier to use another app or service to move the data to another location, such as Azure Blob storage, or an analysis tool, such as Microsoft Power BI.

The Data Archive extension is used by the following batch jobs for date compression.

|Batch jobs  |
|---------|
|Date Comp. Item Budget Entries |
|Date Compress Bank Acc. Ledger |
|Date Compress Customer Ledger |
|Date Compress FA Ledger |
|Date Compress General Ledger |
|Date Compress Insurance Ledger |
|Date Compress Maint. Ledger |
|Date Compress Maint. Ledger |
|Date Compress Resource Ledger |
|Date Compress VAT Entries |
|Date Compress Vendor Ledger |
|Date Compress Whse. Entries |
|Date Compr. G/L Budget Entries |

To start archiving data when you run one of the batch jobs, turn on the **Archive Deleted Entries** toggle.

## Storage Considerations

The archived data is stored in the **Tenant Media** table. We recommend that you export old archives to, for example, a CSV file and then delete the old archive records.

# Managing contacts

Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that might develop into formal relationships. All such external contacts and their detailed information should be recorded in the system so that communication is more successful and so they can easily be converted to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

Use the **Contacts** list to manage your contacts. From there, you can create opportunities and manage other interactions with individual contacts. You can also see statistics about a contact, and you can access a range of reports. For information about how to find the right contact in the list, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md) .  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Understand the general ledger and Chart of Accounts

The general ledger (G/L) stores your financial data, and the chart of accounts (COA) shows the accounts that you post general ledger entries to. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that's ready to support your business.

## General ledger setup and general posting setup

The setup of the general ledger is at the core of financial processes because it defines how you post data. Two pages in particular play an important part in configuring your finance processes:  

* **General Ledger Setup**
* **General Posting Setup**

### The **General Ledger Setup** page

Use the **General Ledger Setup** page to specify how to handle certain accounting issues in your company, such as:  

* Invoice rounding details  
* Address formats  
* Financial reporting

> [!TIP]
> The **General Ledger Setup** page includes generic fields, and fields that are particular to your country or region. If you're unsure of the meaning of a field, we suggest you work with your accountant to determine whether it's relevant to your organization. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Ledger Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=118).

### The **General Posting Setup** page

Use the **General Posting Setup** page to set up combinations of general business and general product posting groups. Posting groups map entities such as customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents to general ledger accounts. You fill in a line for each combination of business posting group and product posting group. But you can also open each line in its own posting setup card. Learn more at [Posting Group Setups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you can't see the fields you're looking for in the **General Posting Setup** page, use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Posting Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=314).

## The chart of accounts

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the general ledger (G/L) account card to add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

To learn more, go to [Understanding the Chart of Accounts](finance-chart-of-accounts.md).

## Account categories

You can personalize the structure of your financial statements by mapping general ledger accounts to account categories.  

The **G/L Account Categories** page shows your categories and subcategories, and the general ledger accounts assigned to them. You can create new subcategories and assign those categories to existing accounts.  

You can create a category group by indenting other subcategories under a line on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Category groups make it easy to get an overview because each grouping shows a total balance. For example, you can create subcategories for different types of assets, then create category groups for fixed assets versus current assets.  

You can define whether specific types of reports must include the accounts in each subcategory. The account categories help define the layout of your financial statements.  

### Example

For example, the default balance statement has a subcategory for *Cash* under *Current Assets*. If you want the balance statement to consider petty cash and checking, take the following steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Account Categories**, then choose the related link.
   1. Alternatively, [open the page here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=790).
2. Choose the **Edit List** action.
3. Add two new subcategories: One for petty cash, and one for your checking account:
   1. Select the **Current Assets** category.
   2. Choose the **New** action.
   3. Enter the subcategory name on the **Description** field.
   4. On the **G/L Accounts in Category** field, select the appropriate G/L account.
   5. On the **Additional Report Definition** field, select the **Cash Accounts** option.
4. Indent them under the **Cash** subcategory.
   1. Select the subcategory created in step 3.
   2. Choose the **Indent** action.
   3. Choose the **Move Down** action.
   4. Choose the **Indent** action to indent under the **Cash** subcategory.

When you choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action, or the next time the report is generated, your balance statement shows the following lines:

* Total balance for cash.
* Lines with balances for petty cash and the checking account.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a G/L account without assigning an account category, when you assign the account to a posting group [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the account category from the G/L account immediately above the account in your chart of accounts. However, to include the new account in your financial reports, you must choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Alternatively, open the G/L Account Card page, specify the account category, and then regenerate your financial report.

## Access to create and edit G/L accounts and account categories

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit financial entities such as G/L accounts, account categories, and the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing these entities. If you're an administrator, or have the *Business Manager* or *Accountant* role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimensions-for-customers-vendors-and-other-accounts).

# Define user tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

Some usage scenarios for User Tasks are 

| If you work with... | Set up user tasks to track or follow-up on... |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Finance             | Month-end checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Adjust cost<br>* Set a posting date range<br>* Close an inventory period<br>* Reconcile accounts payable (AP)<br>* Reconcile accounts receivable (AR)<br>* Recurring journals<br>* Bank reconciliation |
| Finance             | Year-close checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Financial reporting (prepare and finalize annual financial statements)<br>* Audit preparation (gather necessary documents and information for external auditors)<br>* Budget review (compare actual performance against budget and analyze variances)<br>* Budget planning (develop the budget for the next fiscal year)<br>* Accounts receivable (follow up on outstanding invoices for the fiscal year and write off bad debts if necessary)<br>* Accounts payable (ensure all bills and expenses for the fiscal year are recorded and paid)<br>* Check whether fixed assets depreciations for the fiscal year are posted |

The list of sample user tasks for sales in the table was generated by AI using Microsoft Copilot. If you want to generate similar lists for your work domain, consider copying and modifying the following prompt:

```Copilot prompt
Come up with a list of common tasks for people working in a sales team that would be useful to track in a system. 

Format the list in bullet form
```

## Managing user task groups

You can use **User Task Groups** to group related tasks and assign them to a group of users instead of individual users. For example, you could create a group for "Month-end" activities and then assign membership to users in the accounting department. This way, anyone in the team can pick up tasks.

## Managing user tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.  

:::image type="content" source="media/across-user-tasks/sample-user-task.png" alt-text="Example of a user task.":::

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you can't link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible. For example, write "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking up user tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

After you complete a task, mark it as completed.  

### Deleting user tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks to delete.

# Manage Budgets for Fixed Assets

You can set up budgeted fixed assets. For example, this lets you include anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.  

To prepare your budgeted income statement, budgeted balance sheet, and cash budget, you need information about future investments, disposals and depreciation of fixed assets. You can get this information from the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report. Before you print this report, you must prepare the budget.  

## To budget the acquisition cost of a fixed asset

To prepare a budget, you have to set up fixed asset cards for fixed assets that you intend to buy in the future. The budget fixed assets are set up as ordinary fixed assets, but it must be set up to not post to the general ledger.

When you post the acquisition cost, you enter the number of the budgeted fixed asset in the **Budgeted FA No.** field. This will post an acquisition cost with an opposite sign for the budgeted asset. This means that the total acquisition cost on the budgeted asset is the difference between the budgeted and the actual acquisition cost.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new fixed asset card for the budgeted fixed asset.
3. Select the **Budgeted Asset** check box to prevent posting to the general ledger.
4. Fill in the remaining fields, assign a depreciation book, and then post the first acquisition cost with the budgeted fixed asset entered in the **Budgeted FA No.** field on the journal line. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).

## To budget the disposal of a fixed asset

If you plan to sell assets within the budget period, you can enter information about sales price and sales date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset to be disposed of, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.
3. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Projected Disposal Date** and **Projected Proceeds on Disposal** fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To view projected disposal values

To see the projected disposal values and have the gain and loss calculated, you can use the **FA Projected Value** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

## To budget depreciation

You can use the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report to calculate future depreciation. The report shows the book value and accumulated depreciation at the start of the selected period, changes during the period, and the book value and accumulated depreciation at the end of the selected period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To see total values for all assets, clear the **Print per Fixed Asset** check box.
4. Leave the **Fixed Asset** FastTab blank to have all assets included. In the **Budgeted Asset** field, enter **No** to exclude budgeted assets or **Yes** to see budgeted assets only.
5. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

# Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer, you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract.  
  
By handling a service item under multiple contracts, you can do the following:  
  
* Issue different contracts for the same service item.  
* Service parts separately.  
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item, such as mechanical components and software.  
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item.  
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods.  
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order.  
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements.  
  
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality.  
  
## Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item  
You can manually create a service contract or contract quote for service items already registered in non-canceled contracts owned by the same customer. To do this, follow the standard procedure of creating service contracts and service contract quotes. For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md).  
  
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes, a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes. If you confirm this message, all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line.  
  
## Copying Documents  
You can automatically create a service contract or contract quote for service items that are already registered in other service contracts or contract quotes by using the **Copy from Document** action.  
  
## Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts  
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts. A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired.

# Consolidate Balances for a Company that is a Customer and a Vendor
A company that you do business with might be both a customer and a vendor. When that's the case, you can avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and perhaps save on transaction fees, by consolidating the company's customer and vendor balances. Consolidation compares the company's balances as a vendor and as a customer, and then nets the amount so that that either the customer or vendor balance remains, depending on which amount was higher. 

To consolidate the balances, you must first link the customer and vendor companies through a contact that has the type **Company**. A customer or vendor can only have one contact of the type **Company**. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

After you link the companies, the **Customer Card** page offers the **Balance as Vendor** field, and the **Vendor Card** page includes the **Balance as Customer** field.

Though it's not a requirement, the customer and vendor companies are typically the same legal entity. 

## Before you start
Before you consolidate balances, specify a few settings on the **Marketing Setup** page. 

* On the **Interactions** FastTab, you must specify business relation codes in the **Customers** and **Vendors** fields. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses this information to determine the type of relation to display for contacts. 
* Optional: On the **Duplicates** FastTab, turn duplicate search on or off. By default, duplicate search is turned on. For more information, see [Handling duplicates](#handling-duplicates). 

## Link an existing customer and vendor company through a contact
The following steps describe how to link a customer and a vendor through a contact.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer or vendor, and then choose the **Contact** action.   
3. Choose the contact, and then choose the **Link with existing** action.
4. Choose the type of entity to create a business relation with.
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Create a vendor from a customer, or vice versa
You can create a new vendor from an existing customer, or a new customer from a vendor. From the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, open the **Contact** page. Choose the **Create as** action, and then either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## Create a new customer or vendor and link them through a vendor or customer contact
1. Create a new customer or vendor. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
2. After you set up the customer or vendor, choose the **Create** action, and then choose either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## To consolidate the customer and vendor balances for a contact company
On the **Payment Journal** page, use the **Net Customer/Vendor Balances** action to consolidate the customer and vendor balances into a single net amount. The action creates, but doesn't post, payment journal lines that contain the net balances.

> [!NOTE]
> If the customer or vendor balances contain amounts that are in different currencies, a line is created for the amount in each currency.

## Handling duplicates
If you turn on duplicate search on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, a warning will display when you change the values of fields that are part of the setup for duplicate search strings. When a duplicate is found, you can take the following actions:

* Combine the duplicate contacts into a single contact that is the same for both the customer and vendor by using the **Merge With** capability on the **Contact Card** page. Typically, merging contacts is done only when the customer and vendor are the same legal entity. For more information, see [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md). 
* Delete the vendor business relation for the vendor or customer contact, and then use the **Link to Existing** action to link to a different contact.

# Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze fixed assets data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets," "Depreciations over time," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets processes:

- [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

<!-- TODO: add examples for 

insurance coverage ledger entries

-->

## Fixed assets ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of fixed assets scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Fixed Assets (Current value)](#example-fixed-assets-current-value) | Track asset value, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Date**, **FA Posting Type**, and **Amount** |
| [Asset value changes over time](#example-asset-value-changes-over-time) | Track asset value changes over time. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **FA Posting Type**, **FA Posting Date**, and **Amount** |
|[Fixed asset depreciations over time](#example-fixed-asset-depreciations-over-time) | Track depreciations over time, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Year**, **FA Posting Month**, **Amount**, and **FA Posting Type** |

### Example: fixed assets current value

## Using the Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis query

You can use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query to analyze fixed asset ledger entries. The query adds additional information to the ledger entries, such as the fixed asset class, subclass, location, and depreciation book.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets

When you post fixed asset journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **FA Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets is typically done on the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604) page.

You might also want to use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query.

# Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time

Instead of posting individual documents one by one, you can select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate posting or for batch posting according to a schedule, such as at the end of the day. This may be useful if only a supervisor can post documents created by other users or to avoid system performance issues from posting during work hours.

## To post multiple purchase orders immediately

The following procedure explains how to post multiple purchase orders immediately. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post** action.
6. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

## To batch post multiple purchase orders

The following procedure explains how to batch post purchase orders. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents where the **Batch Post** action is available.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post Batch** action.
6. On the **Batch Post Purchase Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **OK** button.
8. To view potential issues that occurred during batch posting of documents, open the **Error Message Register** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Posting of multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To set up background posting with job queues
Job queues are an effective tool to schedule the running of business processes in the background, such as when multiple users are trying to post sales orders, but only one order can be processed at a time.  

The following procedure explains how to set up background posting of sales orders. The steps are similar for purchasing.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the **Post with Job Queue** check box.
3. Choose the **Job Queue Category Code** field, and then specify the **SALESPOST** code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some jobs change the same data and should not run at the same time because that can cause conflicts. For example, background jobs for sales documents will try to modify the same data at the same time. Job queue categories help prevent these kinds of conflicts by ensuring that when one job is running, another job that belongs to the same job queue category will not run until it finishes. For example, a job that belongs to a Sales job queue category will wait until all other sales related jobs are done. You specify a job queue category on the **Background Posting** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
    >
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides job queue categories for sales, purchase, and general ledger posting. We recommend that one of these, or one that you create, is always specified. If you experience failures due to conflicts, consider setting up a category for all sales, purchase, and general ledger background posting.

    If you also want sales documents to be printed when they are posted, select the **Post & Print with Job Queue** check box on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  
    If you select **PDF** in the **Report Output Type** field, successfully posted purchase orders will be available in the **Report Inbox** part on your Role Center.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you set up a job that will post and print documents, and the printer displays a dialog box, such as a request for credentials or a warning about low printer ink, your document is posted but not printed. The corresponding job queue entry eventually times out and the **Status** field is set to **Error**. Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use a printer setup that requires interaction with the display of printer dialog boxes in conjunction with background posting.

    Next time that you post sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a job queue entry for each document and run the jobs in the background, one by one.

4. To verify that the job queue is working as expected, post a sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
    The sales order will now be added to a dedicated job queue entry, which defines when the documents are posted. 

### To view status from a sales or purchase document
If the job queue cannot post the sales order, the status is changed to **Error** and the sales order is added to the list of sales orders that the user must handle manually.
1. From the document that you have tried to post with background posting, choose the **Job Queue Status** field, which will contain **Error**.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

Alternatively, you can review on the **Job Queue Log Entries** page if the sales order was posted successfully. For more information, see the [Monitor the job queue](#monitor-the-job-queue) section.

## To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders

Alternatively, you can postpone postings for when it is convenient for your organization. For example, in your business it might make sense to run certain routines when most of the data entry for the day has concluded. You can achieve this by setting the job queue up to run various batch-posting reports, such as the **Batch Post Sales Orders**, **Batch Post Sales Invoices**, and similar reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports background posting for all sales, purchasing, and service documents.

The following procedure shows how to set the **Batch Post Sales Orders** report up to automatically post sales orders at 4 PM on weekdays.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select 296, **Batch Post Sales Orders**.

   You can also use following reports:
  
   * 900 **Batch Post Assembly Orders**
   * 497 **Batch Post Purchase Invoices**
   * 496 **Batch Post Purchase Orders**
   * 498 **Batch Post Purch. Credit Memos**
   * 6665 **Batch Post Purch. Ret. Orders**
   * 298 **Batch Post Sales Credit Memos**
   * 297 **Batch Post Sales Invoices**
   * 296 **Batch Post Sales Orders**
   * 6655 **Batch Post Sales Return Orders**
   * 6005 **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos**
   * 6004 **Batch Post Service Invoices**
   * 6001 **Batch Post Service Orders**

5. Select the **Report Request Page** check box.
6. In the **Batch Post Sales Orders** request page, define what is included during automatic posting of sales orders, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to set strict filters; otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they are not ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value *Released*, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value *..today*. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
7. Select all check boxes from **Run on Mondays** through **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter 4 PM.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Sales orders that are within defined filters will now be posted every weekday at 4 PM.

## Monitor the job queue

If you set up background posting with job queues, make it a regular task to monitor the job queue to catch any issues. You can track the status in the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

As an administrator, you can use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that you can use to identify problems. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) in the developer and administration content.

# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

Starting in 2025 release wave 1 (update 26.0), admins can control precisely who has access to Chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).

## Can Copilot answer questions about any records? 

When you chat with Copilot about records and pages, Copilot searches your company data within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on your behalf and can only access the data you have permission to access. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s extensive security, privacy, and compliance controls also apply to Copilot. For example, you can't ask Copilot to show masked or secret fields or retrieve records controlled by record-level security.

## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)].

## In which countries or regions can I chat with Copilot?

Starting in update 25.4, chat is available in all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] countries and regions. If you're unable to access the chat pane, find the answer in [What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?](#what-can-i-do-if-the-chat-pane-doesnt-show)

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

As of January 2025, chat is available no matter which language you use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Does chat work with my customizations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- If you ask questions to find records, it can find records in your custom tables that use custom fields.
- If you ask Copilot for an explanation or guidance, it doesn't have access to any information about your customizations or documentation for your add-ons.

Learn how to improve Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## How does Copilot locate records? 

When you ask to find a single record, multiple records, or a field from a record, Copilot uses various mechanisms to search for this information. Copilot generates the appropriate sorting and filtering on list pages and their corresponding source tables. It uses the fields on the page and fields on the underlying tables as part of these operations and in its responses.

## Does Copilot have access to all fields on a table? 

No. Copilot has access to most but not all fields when finding records. For example, it excludes fields that might contain passwords or other secrets. Learn which field data types are excluded in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

Similarly, when you ask Copilot to show a specific field from a record, some fields are excluded and might not be part of Copilot’s response. For example, if your admin hasn't given you permission to personalize Business Central, Copilot shows only the fields typically displayed by default on the list pages.

## How do I open a record or page from chat?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it shows any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## Why do I get different answers from Copilot for the same question?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't always identical.

## How do I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## Can I customize or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified directly through customization, add-ins, tools, or personalization. 
Learn about how to influence Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## Does Copilot search for data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into. It doesn't search for data across multiple environments or companies.

## How does chat treat data residency? 

The chat feature relies on Azure OpenAI Service for AI and Microsoft Learn for online documentation. Learn more about data residency and Azure OpenAI Service in [Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data](azure-openai-data.md) and [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

Microsoft Learn online service endpoints are available in the US, Switzerland, and Europe Azure geographies. For EU customers, this means their data never leaves the EU Data Boundary, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always connects to endpoints in Switzerland or Europe Azure geographies.

If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is deployed to any other Azure geography, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Microsoft Learn online service outside your environment's geographic region or compliance boundary. When you use chat to ask for explanations on how to do things in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], only a few search keywords derived from your message to Copilot are sent to the Microsoft Learn online service in a different Azure geography. They're processed and not stored for more than one day.

To prevent chat from connecting to the Microsoft Learn online service, deactivate the chat feature using the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features).

## What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?

- Make sure your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is version 25.4 or later.
- For Business Central versions 25.4 to 25.5, make sure the entry for "Chat with Copilot" is enabled for all users in the **Feature Management** page.
- Make sure you have permission to chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).
- For Business Central version 26 and later, make sure **Chat** is active in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. In some countries and regions, Chat with Copilot isn't active by default. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## How is Microsoft improving chat with Copilot?

We're continually working on improving reliability and response time. We announced the next expansion of chat where Copilot can answer questions about how to use installed add-on apps. Learn more in [Chat with Copilot to learn how to use installed add-on apps](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/chat-copilot-learn-use-installed-add-on-apps).

We encourage administrators to try out experimental features on sandbox environments. To experience the latest improvements to chat, enable the **Feature: Enables advanced navigation (not data) search capabilities by utilizing semantic similarity search on application metadata.** key on the **Feature Management** page. This feature uses superior AI technology to match user inquiries with the names of pages, fields, and tables. Learn more in [Use semantic search to find pages and reports with Copilot chat](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/semantic-search-feature-key).

We look forward to getting your feedback about how Copilot can provide better assistance to your workday.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to find records, the way you phrase the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers concise, the chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds more relevant records.

## Why does Copilot give incorrect answers to calculations?

While in preview, chat with Copilot can help you find records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and start speaking. Learn more at [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).

# General Journal Post Line Overview

Codeunit 12, **Gen. Jnl.-Post Line**, is the major application object for general ledger posting and is the only place to insert general ledger, VAT, and customer and vendor ledger entries. This codeunit is also used for all Apply, Unapply and Reverse operations.  
  
In Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 R2, the codeunit was redesigned because it had become very large, with approximately 7,600 code lines. The architecture was changed and the codeunit has been made simpler and more maintainable. This documentation describes the changes and provides information that you will need for upgrade.  
  
## Old Architecture  
The old architecture had the following features:  
  
* There was extensive use of global variables, which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope.  
* There were many long procedures (with more than 100 code lines) that also had high cyclomatic complexity (that is, a lot of CASE, REPEAT, IF nested statements), which made the code very difficult to read and maintain.  
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local.  
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables. Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals.  
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place. In addition, there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code.  
* A large part of the code in codeunit 12, approximately 30 percent, related to payment discount and tolerance calculations, although these features are not needed in many countries or regions.  
* Posting, Apply, Unapply, Reverse, Payment Discount and Tolerance, and Exchange Rate Adjustment were married together in codeunit 12 using a long list of global variables.  
  
### New Architecture  
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], codeunit 12 has had the following improvements:  
  
* Codeunit 12 has been refactored into smaller procedures (all less than 100 code lines).  
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables.  
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries, the collection of VAT adjustment, and the calculation of additional currency amounts.  
* Code duplication has been eliminated.  
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables.  
* The use of global variables has been minimized, so that each procedure uses parameters and encapsulates its own application logic.

# Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts

You can rate a prospect so you can identify the ideal prospects to focus your sales campaign on. You can set up profile questionnaires that you want to use when entering information about your contacts' profiles. Within each questionnaire, you can set up the different questions you intend to ask your contacts. This way, you can group contacts so that your campaigns are more likely to target the right people based on the criteria that you define with the questionnaires.  

With the right questionnaires, you can rate your prospects and group them into categories. You can use existing questions and answers and combine them with new questions and answers to form the basis of your rating. Each answer in the rating is given a point value and, depending on the range you set up for the categories (*From Value* and *To Value*), the rating system will group your contacts in the categories you have defined. For example, *ABC* customers, *High/Low loyalty* vendors, or *Platinum/Gold/Silver* prospects.  

You can also run the questionnaire to answer some of the questions based on contact, customer, or vendor data automatically.  

## To add a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Questionnaire Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** Action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To add questions to a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the relevant profile questionnaire, and then choose the **Edit Questionnaire Setup** action.  
2. On the first empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Question** and type your question in the **Description** field. Fill in the other fields on this line.  

    Optionally, add details to the question.

    1. Choose the line with the question, and then, choose the **Line** menu, and then choose **Question Details**.  

    2. On the **Classification** FastTab in the **Profile Question Details** page, select the **Auto Contact Classification** field.  

    3. In the **Contact Class. Field** field, select the **Rating** option.  

    4. Fill in the **Min. % Questions Answered** field. The default is **0**.  

        This specifies the number of questions in percentage that must be answered for this rating to be calculated.

    5. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Page** group, choose **Answer Points**. Enter the points you want to give each answer listed in the **Answer Points** page.

        If you want to get an overview of the points you have given each answer, choose the **Answer Points** action.

    6. To run an update, return to the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page. On the **Actions** menu, in the **Functions** group, choose **Update Classification**.

    In the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page, the number of contacts that meets this criteria is displayed in the **No. of Contacts** field, as well as on the **Contact Card** of each contact.

3. On the next empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Answer** and type your answer in the **Description** field.  
4. In the **Priority** field, select the priority. In the **From Value** and **To Value** fields, define a point range. Contacts that receive points within the defined range will get the answer.  

Repeat these steps to enter all the questions and answers within the profile questionnaire.

After you have created a questionnaire, you can use it to rate and classify your contacts. You can also set up questions that are rated automatically based on information in the contact card.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you enter a question that is automatically answered, choose **Line**, and then choose **Question Details**, to enter the criteria to automatically answer the question.

## Apply questionnaires to contacts

You can apply your questionnaires to contacts manually. Just open the relevant contact card, and then choose the **Profile** action. Then, once you have applied the questionnaires that you want to apply, you can start using the categories in your campaigns.  

## The Automatic Classification of Contacts

You can automatically classify your contacts according to customer, vendor, and contact information, by setting up automatically answered profile questions on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts that are recorded as customers can be assigned a classification based on customer data and only contacts that are recorded as vendors can be assigned a classification based on vendor data. The automatic classification is not updated automatically. Consequently, you may want to update the profile questionnaires, after you have updated the customer, vendor or contact data they are based on.  

After you have set up automatically answered profile questions, if you assign the profile questionnaire containing these questions to a contact, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically assign the right answers for the contact.  

## Example

You can classify your contacts according to how much they bought from you:

|Answer|Applies to|
|--- |--- |
|A|contacts who bought for 500,000 LCY or more|
|B|contacts who bought for 100,000 up to 499,999 LCY|
|C|contacts who bought for 99,999 LCY or less|

To do this, fill on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page as follows:

| Type     | Description        | Automatic Classification     | From Value | To Value |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Question | ABC Classification | Click to insert a check mark |            |          |
| Answer   | A                  |                              | 500,000    |          |
| Answer   | B                  |                              | 100,000    | 499,999  |
| Answer   | C                  |                              |            | 99,999   |

Then fill on the **Profile Question Details** page as follows:

| Field                         | Value         |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Customer Classification Field | Sales (LCY)   |
| Classification Method         | Defined Value |

When you assign the profile questionnaire containing this question to a contact, application automatically enters the relevant answer for this contact on the profile lines of the contact card.

# Moving Averages (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management teams find key trends and make changes based on average purchase metrics.

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Moving Averages* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Amount Average 30D**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

# Planning With or Without Locations

Before you start utilizing planning engine, we recommend deciding about whether or not to use locations. There are two main straightforward ways:

* demand lines always carry location codes and the system fully uses stockkeeping units, including the relevant location setup. Learn more at [Demand at location](#demand-at-location).  
* demand lines never carry location codes and the system uses the item card. See the [Demand at a "blank location"](#demand-at-blank-location) scenario below.

## Demand at location  

When the planning system detects demand at a location (a line with a location code), it will behave in different ways depending on 2 critical setup values.  

During a planning run, the system checks for the 2 setup values in sequence and plans accordingly:  

1. Does a SKU exist for the item on the demanded location?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card.  

    If no, then:  

2. Does the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page contain the demanded location code?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

    If no, then:  

    The item is planned according to the "minimal alternative" which covers the exact demand. The planning parameters are set as: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot*, Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty. (Items using reordering policy *Order* remain using *Order* as well as the other settings.)

> [!TIP]
> If you often plan for demand at different locations, then we recommend that you use the stockkeeping units capability and avoid demand on blank location. Learn more at [Set Up Stockkeeping Units](inventory-how-to-set-up-stockkeeping-units.md)

See variations in the [scenarios below](#scenarios).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page are very important in governing how the planning system handles production demand lines.
>
> For production demand, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the same location for subassembly and components as the one stated on the production order. However, by filling in this field, you can redirect the subassembly and components to another location.
>
> You can also define this for a specific SKU by selecting a different location code in the **Components at Location** field on the SKU card. Note, however, that this rarely makes sense as the planning logic may be distorted when planning for the SKU component.

## Demand at "blank location"

In general, when the planning system detects demand at a blank location (a line without a location code), the item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

The **Locations Mandatory** field in the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page, or stockkeeping units will affect how the planning system handles demand lines with/without location codes. If one of following statements is true, the demand on blank location is also considered a deviation and the planning system will react by outputting the "minimal alternative": The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

* The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page has a value.
* A stockkeeping unit exists for the planned item.
* The **Location Mandatory** field is selected.

## Scenarios

See variations in the setup scenarios below.

### Setup 1

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* SKU is set up for *WEST*  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 1.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card (including possible transfer).

#### Case 1.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

#### Case 1.3: Demand is at *MAIN* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 1.4: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 2

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 2.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 2.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

### Setup 3

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 3.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 3.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

#### Case 3.3: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 4

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *BLANK*  

#### Case 4.1: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 4.2: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

As you can see from the last scenario, the only way to get a correct result for a demand line without a location code is to disable all setup values relating to locations. Similarly, the only way to get stable planning results for demand at locations is to use stockkeeping units.  

Therefore, if you often plan for demand at locations, then we recommend that you use the Stockkeeping Units capability.

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.  

> [!TIP] 
> Verify your mapping by choosing the **Overview** action.  

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"></a>Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, and then fill in the fields, including the API URL and API key provided from Azure Machine Learning studio. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

# Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use the Sales Order Agent to automate taking sales orders based on customer inquiries about products/items received via email.

The Sales Order Agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. When it identifies a potential request, it starts converting the request into an order. For example, it verifies the customer, checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer with the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, such as reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles email exchanges with the customer to resolve any missing details and allow for modifications to the original request if necessary.

Learn more about the Sales Order Agent and its process flow in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md#how-the-agent-processes-requests).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

The Sales Order Agent is activated, and you have permission to use it. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

## Get started

You collaborate with the Sales Order Agent to review and convert quotes into orders using the **Tasks** tab in the **Copilot** pane.

To access this view, select ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon.](media/soa-activated-number-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** on the upper right of the navigation menu. A red circle with a number on the icon indicates the tasks that need attention.

![Shows the task view with steps](media/soa-task-view-callouts.png)

The ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** tab opens in the **Copilot** pane to display tasks recently created by the Sales Order Agent. Tasks that require attention&mdash;like reviewing an incoming or outgoing email&mdash;are at the top of the list.  

For each sales quote request, the Sales Order Agent adds a task to track, review, and follow up on updates, eventually processing the quote into an order. Tasks can consist of multiple steps that form a timeline of the process.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon with an open action.](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon in the role or select the ![Show summary for Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-summary-icon.png) **Show summary for Sales Order Agent** in the **Task** tab to get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) summarizing the impact of the agent's work in your organization. For example, view the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent, the time saved by your team, and the total number of sales orders created.

## Review and assist

While the agent does the bulk of work autonomously, it asks for user intervention when required for various steps to move through the process, such as:

- Reviewing and confirming incoming email requests from customers.
- Reviewing and confirming the sales quotes and orders if an admin configured the Sales Order Agent to do so.
- Reviewing outgoing emails created by the Sales Order Agent for the customer.
- Providing assistance to the Sales Order Agent when it needs to get unblocked, for example to provide missing data.

Steps requiring intervention are listed under **Needs Attention** in the **Tasks** tab. To review a step:

1. In **Task** tab, select the step requesting review or assistance.

   The task *timeline* opens, focused on the selected step. The timeline displays each step of a task, past and present, in chronological order.

1. Select **Review** for the step.

   The **Tasks** tab switches to **Review** mode, and the Agent Task Message window opens to display the email contents or quote or order, depending on the task.

1. Review the email contents or the quote or order and make changes as needed. You can't edit incoming emails from the customer.

1. When you're satisfied with the content and want the process to continue, select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. If you want to complete the task yourself, select **Stop** to halt the agent's processing of this task.

After confirmation, the Sales Order Agent continues processing the task. When a new notification appears on the Sales Order Agent icon after some time, follow the same flow to verify and approve the results.

## Modify sales quotes and orders

You might need to modify sales quotes or orders created by the agent during a review step or when the agent requests assistance, based on its configuration. When you select **Review**, the quote or order opens for inspection. Make changes as needed, then select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. The agent processes the document, creating a PDF for the outgoing email to the customer.

You also have the opportunity to modify a quote or order during the review step for an outgoing email. In this case, select **...** (More options) > **Discard step** on the step. This action stops the task temporarily to allow you to open the quote or order and makes changes and then resume the step.

![Shows the discard step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-discard-step.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Discard step** is available only on review steps for outgoing emails.

After you make the changes, return to the **Tasks** tab, select one of the following options for resuming the task, and then select **Send**:

- **I have updated the quote** or **I have updated the order** - Select one of these options if you made changes to the quote or order. The agent generates a new PDF and email for the customer.
- **Just resume** - Select this option if you didn't change the quote or order. The agent doesn't generate a new quote or order and keeps the original email as before.  

![Shows the resume step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-resume-step.png)

If you change your mind while reviewing the outgoing message and decide to make more changes to the sales document, use the **Discard step** action to discard the email message generated by the agent. Then, update the sales document as needed and instruct the agent to create a new outgoing email with the updated attachment.

## Assist with item availability

Depending on the agent's setup, it can check item availability in the requested quantity before adding them to a quote or order. You can't change the items and quantities at this point, but you can review and confirm the step so the agent creates a reply email to the customer.

<!--
1. Select **Review** to open the **Items availability** page.
1. Use the page to verify that the item isn't available in the requested quantity.
1. Select **Confirm**.

   The agent creates the reply email for review.-->

Learn more in [Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-item-availability.md).

## Stop a task

Most steps of a task include a **Stop** button that lets you terminate the process. When you select **Stop**, a task isn't terminated immediately—you're asked to confirm before the task is stopped.

Before you stop a task, consider the following behavior:

- Stopped tasks can't be restarted.
- Stopping the task might leave some results incomplete or unwanted, and it might require follow-up actions with the customers. Follow up actions depend on where in the process the task was stopped.

  For example, suppose you stopped a task after a sales quote was created. Although the process stopped, the sales quote is still stored in the system as open. You might have to manually edit the state depending on your company policy and then update the customer.
- Stopped tasks aren't deleted immediately. You can still explore a task's timeline until it's deleted, typically by an administrator.

<!--
## Discard and resume a taks to modify a quote or order

## View timeline and details of steps

From the ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** view, you can view the details of each step of a task in chronological order. Click on the task or select **...** (More options) > **Show Details**.-->

## Scenarios impacting reliability in handling customer requests

- You might need to correct the quantities in the created document when non-base units of measurement differ from the standard ones.  

  For example, if the system treats 1 kilogram as 900 grams and a customer requests 2 kilograms, the system might generate a document showing 2,000 grams instead of 1,800 grams or 2 kilograms.

- Reliability decreases if you significantly change the email the agent drafts about item availability before sending it to the customer.

  This issue is more apparent when the external customer follows up with an email using pronouns like "them" or "it" and other words instead of repeating specific quantities and names. For example, the customer replies, "I want them all."

- The agent searches for items using item attributes, but the attributes aren't shown to the agent on the item availability page. This condition decreases reliability for customer requests that depend specifically on the attributes.

  Consider the following example:

  1. Items in the database:
  
     `[{no: ITEM-1, description: Shirt, attributes: Linen}, {no: ITEM-2, description: Shirt, attributes: Cotton}]`

  2. Customer's initial request email:

     `I want a quote for nice shirts`

  3. Agent's reply email:
  
     `We have X quantity of ITEM-1 Shirt and ITEM-2 Shirt`

  4. Customer's response email:
  
     `I want the ones with linen material`

- Reliability decreases when the agent retrieves information from multiple email exchanges with a customer, and the customer uses pronouns or vague references like "that," "them," or "it" in their requests.

# Connect to Microsoft Dataverse

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, businesses create the connection to integrate and synchronize data with another Dynamics 365 business app, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

## Before you start

There are a few pieces of information to have ready before you create the connection:  

* The URL for the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that you want to connect to. If you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide to create the connection we'll find your environments. You can also enter the URL of another environment in your tenant.  
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
* If you have an on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1, version 16.5, read the [Some Known Issues](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/known-issues#wrong-net-assemblies-for-external-connected-services) article. You'll have to complete the described workaround before you can create your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
* The local currencies that each company uses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency. To learn more about how to handle multi-currency setups, go to [Allow for different currencies](#allow-for-different-currencies).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment must not be in Administration mode. Administration mode will cause the connection to fail because the integration user account for the connection does not have administrator permissions. For more information, see [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode).

> [!Note]
> These steps describe the procedure for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises and aren't using a Microsoft Entra account to connect to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must also specify a user name and password of a user account for the integration. This account is referred to as the "integration user" account. If you're using a Microsoft Entra account, the integration user account is not required or displayed. The integration user will be set up automatically and does not require a license.

## Link your Business Central and Dataverse environments

Businesses want to keep their data safe and secure within their privacy boundary, and especially when their business management application integrates with other apps. By linking [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environments, you’ll not only achieve those considerations, but also give your administrators an easier way to create and maintain your integrations with other Dynamics 365 apps.

In the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center, you can link your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can use the information from the link to make it easier, and more secure, to integrate with other Dynamics 365 apps, such as Sales and Field Service. For example, the linked [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment URL is available by default on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page and when you run the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide.

## Allow for different currencies

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency.

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronizing multiple currencies requires that you're using a unidirectional synchronization, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about the base currency in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [Transaction Currency (currency) entity](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/transaction-currency-currency-entity). 

To learn more about currencies in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Currencies in Business Central](finance-currencies.md).

To allow for different currencies, before you connect, be sure that you've specified the following settings:

* The base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency code that's specified on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* There's at least one exchange rate specified for the currency in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The local currency uses the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Because currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* If in the [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency, amounts convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* If in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency, amounts synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the additional, non-base currencies in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

For all authentication types other than Microsoft 365 authentication, you set up your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. For Microsoft 365 authentication, we recommend that you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide. The guide makes it easier to set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as the ownership model and initial synchronization.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the setup of the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the administrator will be asked to give following permissions to a registered Azure application named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:
>
> * **Access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as you** permission is needed so [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can, on behalf of administrator, automatically create non-licensed non-interactive [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user, assign security roles to this user and to deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Solution to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. This permission is used only once during set up of connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
> * **Have full access to Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** permission is needed so automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data that will be synchronized.  
> * **Sign in and read your profile** permission is needed to verify user logging in actually has System Administrator security role assigned in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
>
> By giving consent on behalf of organization, the administrator is entitling the registered Azure application called [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to synchronize data using automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user's credentials.

### To use the Dataverse Connection Setup assisted setup guide

The Dataverse Connection Setup guide can make it easier to connect the applications, and can even help you run an initial synchronization. If you choose to run initial synchronization, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will review the data in both applications and provide recommendations for how to approach initial synchronization. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Recommendation  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Full synchronization**|Data exists only in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or only in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The recommendation is to synchronize all data from the service that has it to the other service.|
|**No synchronization**|Data exists in both applications, and running full synchronization would duplicate the data. The recommendation is to couple records.|
|**Dependency not satisfied**|Data exists in both applications, but the row or table can't be synchronized because it depends on a row or table that has the No synchronization recommendation. For example, if customers can't be synchronized, then data for contacts that depends on the customer data can't be synchronized either.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Typically, you only use full synchronization when you're integrating the applications for the first time, and only one application contains data. Full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment because it automatically creates and couples records in each application, which makes it faster to start working with synchronized data. However, you should only run full synchronization if you want one row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the table mappings. Otherwise, the result can be duplicate records.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Set up a connection to Microsoft Dataverse** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it's probably because pop-ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To create or maintain the connection manually

The following procedure describes how to set up the connection manually on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The **Dataverse Connection Setup** page is where you manage integration settings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the following information for the connection from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----|
    |**Environment URL**|If you own environments in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], we'll find them for you when you run the setup guide. If you want to connect to a different environment in another tenant, you can enter the administrator credentials for the environment and we'll find it. |
    |**Enabled**|Start using the integration. If you don't enable the connection now, the connection settings will be saved but users won't be able to access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can return to this page and enable the connection later.  |

3. In the **Ownership Model** field, choose whether you want a team table in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to own new records, or one or more specific users. If you choose **Person**, you must specify each user. If you choose **Team**, the default business unit will display in the **Coupled Business Unit** field.

    <!--Need to verify the details in this table, are these specific to Sales maybe?  IK: No they are not and no longer relevant 
    Enter the following advanced settings.-->

    <!-- |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----|
    |**[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Users Must Map to CDS Users**|If you're using the Person ownership model, specify whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts must have a matching user accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The **Microsoft 365 Authentication Email** of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user must be the same as the **Primary Email** of the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] user.<br /><br /> If you set the value to **Yes**, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who don't have a matching [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] user account won't have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integration capabilities in the user interface. Access to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is done on behalf of the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] user account.<br /><br /> If you set the value to **No**, all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users will have [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration capabilities in the user interface. Access to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data is done on behalf of the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] connection (integration) user.|
    |**Current Business Central Salesperson is Mapped to a User**|Indicates whether your user account is mapped to an account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] double check the name of this field|-->
4. To test the connection settings, choose **Connection**, and then **Test Connection**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If data encryption is not enabled in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you will be asked whether you want to enable it. To enable data encryption, choose **Yes** and provide the required information. Otherwise, choose **No**. You can enable data encryption later. For more information, see [Encrypting Data in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-encrypting-data) in the developer and administration help.  
5. If [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] synchronization is not already set up, you will be asked whether you want to use the default synchronization setup. Depending on whether you want to keep records aligned in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Yes** or **No**.

## Customize the match-based coupling

Starting in 2021 release wave 2, an administrator can enter criteria to couple records based on matches. You can start the algorithm for matching records from the following places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* List pages that show records that are synchronized with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as the Customers and Items pages.  

    Select multiple records, and then choose the **Related** action, choose **Dataverse**, choose **Coupling**, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from a master data list, a coupling job is scheduled after you specify the coupling criteria.  
* The **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.  

    When the full synchronization process detects uncoupled records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a **Select Coupling Criteria** link appears for the integration table.  

    You can start the **Run Full Synchronization** process from the **Dataverse Connection Setup** and **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** pages. You can also start it in the **Set up a connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide when you complete your setup.  

    When you start the match-based coupling process from the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page, a coupling job is scheduled after you complete the setup.  
* The **Integration Table Mappings** list.  

    Select a mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from an integration table mapping, a coupling job runs for all uncoupled records in the mapping. You can also select uncoupled records in the list to run the job only for those records.

In all three cases, the **Select Coupling Criteria** page opens so that you can define the relevant coupling criteria. In this page, customize the coupling with the following tasks:

* Choose the fields to use to match [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. You can specify whether the match is case-sensitive.  

* Specify whether to synchronize after you couple records. If records use bidirectional mapping, you can also specify what happens if conflicts are listed in the **Resolve Update Conflicts** page.  

* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a *match priority* for the relevant mapping fields. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the value in the **Match Priority** field. A blank value in the **Match Priority** field equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.  

* Specify whether to create a new entity instance in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] in case no unique uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, choose the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.  

### View the results of the coupling job

To view the results of the coupling job, open the **Integration Table Mappings** page, select the relevant mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose the **Integration Coupling Job Log** action.  

If records failed to couple, you can choose the value in the **Failed** column to open a list of errors that describe why that happened.  

Typically, coupling fails for the following reasons:

* No matching criteria was defined

    Run the match-based coupling again, but remember to define coupling criteria.

* No match was found for the fields specified in the matching criteria

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* Multiple matches were found for several records based on the the fields specified in the matching criteria  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* A match was found, but the record is already coupled to a record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields, or investigate why that [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is coupled to the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> To help you get an overview over the progress of the coupling, the **Coupled to Dataverse** field shows whether a record is coupled to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity. You can use the **Coupled to Dataverse** field to filter the list of records you're synchronizing.

## Upgrade connections from Business Central online to use certificate-based authentication

> [!NOTE]
> This section is relevant only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by Microsoft. Online tenants hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations, are not affected.

In April 2022, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] is deprecating the Office365 authentication type (username/password). For more information, see [Deprecation of Office365 authentication type](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse). Additionally, in March 2022, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deprecating the use of client secret based service-to-service authentication for online tenants. You must use certificate-based service-to-service authentication for connections to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations can continue to use client secrets for authentication.

To avoid disrupting integrations, _you must upgrade_ the connection to use certificate-based authentication. Although the change is scheduled for March 2022, we strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible. The following steps describe how to upgrade to certificate-based authentication. 

### To upgrade your Business Central online connection to use certificate-based authentication

1. Depending on whether you integrate with Dynamics 365 Sales, do one of the following:
   * If you do, open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.
   * If you don't, open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.
2. Choose **Connection**, and then **Use Certificate Authentication** to upgrade the connection to use certificate based authentication.
3. Sign in with administrator credentials for Dataverse. It should take less than a minute to sign in.

> [!NOTE]
> You must repeat these steps in each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment, including both production and sandbox environments, and in each company where you have a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Connecting on-premises versions

To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must specify some information on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.

To connect using a Microsoft Entra account, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. You'll have to provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use. The redirect URL is pre-populated and should work for most installations. You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret will be saved as an encrypted string in your database. 

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Dataverse

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information about registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure Portal, under **Manage** on the Navigation Pane, choose **Authentication**.  
2. Under **Redirect URLs**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**.
4. Under **Configured permissions**, choose **Add a permission**, and then add delegated permissions on the **Microsoft APIs** tab as follows:
    * For Business Central, add the **Financials.ReadWrite.All** permissions.
    * For Dynamics CRM, add the **user_impersonation** permissions.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The name of the Dynamics CRM API might change.

5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You will use the secret either in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], in the **Client Secret** field on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, or store in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber as described earlier in this topic.
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This ID is the Client ID of your application. You must enter it either on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in the **Client ID** field, or store it in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, in the **Environment URL** field, enter the URL for your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
8. To enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
9. Sign in with your administrator account for Microsoft Entra ID (this account must have a valid license for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and be an administrator in your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment). After you sign in, you will be prompted to allow your registered application to sign in to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on behalf of the organization. You must give consent to complete the setup.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it is probably because pop ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To disconnect from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

# Update standard costs
You must periodically update the standard costs of components and roll the new costs up to the parent item. The process typically consists of the following four steps:  

1.  Update costs at the component and capacity levels. For more information, see the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
2.  Consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total manufacturing or assembly cost of the items.  
3.  Implement the standard costs that are entered when you run the previous batch jobs. The standard costs don't take effect until they're implemented. Use the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job, which updates the changes in the standard cost on items with the ones in the Standard Cost Worksheet table.  
4.  Implement the changes to update the **Unit Cost** field on the item card and perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).  

For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).
  
## To update standard costs

1.  Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2.  Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:

    1.  Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3.  Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7.  Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4.  Review and post the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Audit changes to financial reporting

Financial reporting helps you gather insights into the financial data in your chart of accounts (COA). This article explains ways to monitor changes to your financial report definitions, and how to control access to financial reports.

## Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to the definitions for financial reports. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for financial report definitions and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Report Definition       | 88  |
| Row Definition          | 84  |
| Column Definition       | 333 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]

## Get notified when financial report definitions change

To add an extra layer of security around your financial report definitions, you can monitor changes to their fields and get an email when someone changes a value. 

To learn more, go to [Get notified when system setup change](across-setup-auditing.md#get-notified-when-system-setup-change)

## Analyze changes to financial report definitions

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to your setup](across-setup-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-your-setup).

## Permissions to view or edit financial reports

The following table lists the permission sets that control whether you can view or edit financial reports and their report definitions.

| Access   | Permission set |
|------------------------| ---------------------- |
| View financial reports. | **Account Schedules - View** |
| Edit financial report definitions, including row and column definitions. | **Account Schedules - Edit** |

# Manage human resources

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

You can also register employee absences, which allows you to analyze registered absences as necessary.

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
You might sometimes have to handle payments to your bank account that can't be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. Reasons might be that no document exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that the payment can be applied to, or the related document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a different amount than the transaction amount, for example, because of currency exchange. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, all transaction amounts for payments that aren't yet applied appear in the **Difference** field, including amounts that can't be applied because of reasons such as the above.

The methods for resolving these types of unapplied payments:
* Apply manually
* Use text-to-account mapping
* Transfer an excess amount to a journal line to create and post the required entry, such as a refund of an overpayment.

Payments that can't be applied can appear on payment reconciliation journal lines in the following different ways:

* The value in the **Difference** field is equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that no part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry.
* The value in the **Difference** field is lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that a part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. The remaining part of the payment can't be applied and must be reconciled manually or by posting it directly to an account.

To reconcile such payments, you can choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action and then specify to which account the amount in the **Difference** field will be posted when you post the payment reconciliation journal. You can do this either from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page or from the **Payment Application Review** page that you open by choosing the value in the **Match Confidence** field or by choosing the **Difference** field.

> [!TIP]  
>   Similar functionality exists to set up automatic reconciliation of recurring payments that cannot be applied to related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entries. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

## To reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Transfer Difference to Account**. The **Transfer Difference to Account** page opens.
4. In the **Account Type** field, specify if the type of account that the payment amount will be posted to.
5. In the **Account No.** field, specify the account that the payment amount will be posted to.
6. In the **Description** field, specify text that describes this direct payment posting. By default, the text in the **Transaction Text** field on the payment reconciliation journal line is inserted.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

If the value in the **Difference** field was equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field when you post the payment reconciliation journal, the whole payment on the journal line will be posted directly to the specified balancing account.

If the value in the **Difference** field was lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, then an additional journal line will be created with the same text and date and with the difference inserted in the **Transaction Amount** field. On the original journal line, the difference will be deducted from the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, and the payment will remain applied to its related customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. When you post the payment reconciliation journal, one part of the payment will be posted as an applied payment. The other part of the payment will be posted directly to the specified account.

# Suggest lines on sales documents with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to create sales documents faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add to lines on sales documents for your customers.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Sales line suggestions

Sales line suggestion can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

- Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

- Find documents by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator activates the **Sales Line Suggestions** capability on the **Copilot & agents capabilities** page. Learn more at [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Examples of prompts

Suggest sales lines with Copilot can handle a wide variety of prompt input. This section offers examples of prompts for various scenarios we tested.

### Sample inquiry to repeat a document

Prompt: *Need all the products from invoice 103031*

### During a phone call, you quickly type a list of required products and quantities, but aren't always exact and sometimes use internal product names

Prompt: *2 Red Kids Biicycle*

The prompt works, even with multiple typos.

### A user copies an inquiry from an inbound communication and pastes it onto the Sales Lines Suggestions page

Prompt: *Hello, I'm interested in buying some accessories for my XXXX Laptop, such as a wireless mouse, a keyboard cover, and a laptop bag. I wonder if you have any recommendations or suggestions for these items. Do you have any special offers or discounts for loyal customers like me? Kind regards, M*

Note that XXXX Laptop isn't included in search.

## Options for matching keywords in prompts

When you search for an item using a FullText index, we extract both primary and extra keywords. For example, we break down the search term "Red Coffee Table" into primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table," and some synonyms and other keywords, such as "Red."

When you enter your prompt in the **Suggest Sales Lines** window, the **Matching** field offers the following options for matching criteria:

- [Permissive](#permissive-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are optional. This option typically generates the most suggestions.
- [Balanced](#balanced-matching-criteria) is a blend of required and optional keywords. This option typically generates fewer suggestions.
- [Precise](#precise-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are required. This option typically generates the fewest suggestions.

The following sections provide examples of how matching works. The examples are based on a prompt for "Red Coffee Table" and you have the following fictitious items:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Permissive matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are optional. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Balanced matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table

### Precise matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is required. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table

## Suggest lines on a sales document

This process describes how to suggest lines on a sales order. The steps are the same for sales quotes and invoices.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open a sales order or create a new one.
1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Suggest sales lines**.
1. In the **Suggested sales lines** window, enter your prompt or select one from the prompt guides.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add to lines, review its suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose the Discard button (trash can) next to the **Keep it** button.
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Keep it**. 

There's a **Reliability** field that displays **High (80+)**, **Medium (60-80)**, and **Low (60-)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to a sales document. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well, or delete the whole document.

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Receive and convert electronic documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. To receive an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, you process the document in the Incoming Documents page to convert it to a purchase invoice or general journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In addition to receiving electronic documents directly from trading partners, you can receive electronic documents from an OCR service that has turned your PDF or image files into electronic documents.  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the document exchange service, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the OCR service, you must set up and enable the preconfigured service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).  

The traffic of electronic documents in and out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is managed by the Job Queue feature. Before you can receive electronic documents, the relevant job queue must be started.  

You can either start the conversion of electronic documents manually, as described in this procedure, or you can enable a workflow to convert electronic documents automatically when they're received. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a workflow template, *From Incoming Electronic through OCR to Open Purchase Invoice Workflow*, which is ready to be copied to a workflow and enabled. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you convert electronic documents received from the OCR service to documents or journal lines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], multiple lines on the source document will be summed on one line. The single line will be of type G/L Account and the **Description** and (G/L account) **No.** fields will be empty. The value in the **Amount** field will equal the total amount excluding VAT of all lines in the source document.  
>
> To make sure that the **Description** and **No.** fields are filled, you can choose the **Map Text to Account** button on the **Incoming Documents** page to define that a certain invoice text is always mapped to a certain debit or credit account in the general ledger. Going forward, the **Description** field on document or journal lines created from an electronic document for that vendor or customer will be filled with the text in question and the (G/L account) **No.** field with the account in question.  
>
> Instead of mapping to a G/L account, you can also map to a bank account. This is practical, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid where you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.  

The following procedure describes how to receive a vendor invoice and convert it to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The procedure is the same when you convert a vendor invoice to a general journal line.  

### To receive and convert an electronic invoice to a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the incoming document record that represents a new incoming electronic invoice, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    On the **Incoming Document Card** page, the related XML file is attached, and most of the fields are prefilled with information from the electronic invoice. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  

3. In the **Data Exchange Type** field, choose **PEPPOL - Invoice** or **OCR – Invoice** depending on the source of the electronic document.  

4. To map text on the vendor invoice to a specific debit account, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Map Text to Account**, and then fill the **Text-to-Account Mapping Worksheet** page.  

5. Choose the **Create Document** action.  

    A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic document.  

    Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing master data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will be shown on the **Error Messages** FastTab.

# Record special sales prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> 2020 release wave 2 introduced new, streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using the latest version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various pricing strategies, such as:

* One-price-fits-all models where an item is always sold at the same price.
* Special price agreements with specific customers, or groups of customers.
* Campaigns when a sale meets the criteria for a special offer. For example, you might have the following criteria for an order:

  * It meets a minimum quantity
  * It's before a certain date
  * It includes a certain type of item  

To use a basic pricing model, you only need to specify a unit price when you set up an item or resource. That price will always be used on sales documents. For more advanced models, for example, when you want to offer special prices for a sales campaign, you can specify criteria on the **Sales Prices** page. You can offer special prices based on a combination of the following information:  

* Customer
* Item
* Unit of measure
* Minimum quantity
* Dates that define the period for which the prices are valid.

After you set up special prices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate best prices on sales and purchase documents, and on lines on projects and item journals. Learn more at [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

For sales discounts, you can set up two types:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sales Line Discount** |Add an amount on sales lines that have a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting and ending date. This type works in the same way as for sales prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from the sales document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item page empty, and do not include the item in any line discount setups.

## To set up a sales price for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab. 

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a special sales price to the customer.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. Draft price lists aren't included in price calculations. When you're done adding lines and want to start using the prices, change the status to **Active**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action. 
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following steps:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter other settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these settings later if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.  

---

## Using sales and purchase price lists

> [!NOTE]
> Using price lists requires that your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

Most of the new sales pricing experience is similar to the current experience, but there are a few differences. Those differences are described in the following sections.

The **Applies-to Type** and **Applies-to No.** fields let you choose what a price list will apply to, such as customer or customer price group. Using **View Columns for**, you can show or hide columns relevant for setting prices, discounts, or prices and discounts.

### Converting existing prices when you turn on the pricing feature update

When you enable the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page, the **Feature Data Update** guide opens. Use the **Use default prices** toggle as follows:

* If you want to work with all prices on a single page, turn it on. Existing prices will be converted to one default price list for each of the following documents:

  * Sales
  * Purchases
  * Job sales
  * Job purchases

  You can edit all prices for these areas on the **Prices Worksheet** page. The default price lists will be set on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchases & Payables Setup,** and **Projects Setup** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If prices are set only on item or resource cards, default price lists will not be filled in with those prices during the data update. However, you can open any of the default price lists or the **Price Worksheet** page and use the **Suggest Lines** action to add the prices set on item or resource cards.

* To use sales price lists, turn it off. Existing prices will be converted to a new price list for each combination of the following things:

  * Customer
  * Customer group or campaign
  * Starting and ending dates
  * Currencies

If you have many combinations, you'll have many price lists.

If you've already enabled the New Pricing Experience, you can create default price lists manually or specify an existing price list as the default. To set an existing price list as default, turn on the **Allow Updating Defaults** toggle on the price list. Then, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchase & Payables**, or **Projects Setup** pages, set the price list as the default.

### Editing active price lists

To allow people to edit prices on active price lists for items, resources, customers, vendors, or other entities that use pricing, turn on the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

When the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle is turned off, to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to **Draft**, make your change, and then reactivate the price list.

The **Prices Overview** page provides an overview of all prices across price lists. You can set filters to narrow down the list of prices you may want to modify or add to. After you modify prices, you must use the **Verify Lines** action to verify the prices against other price list lines. Verifying prices helps avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes **Draft**, and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the **Verify Lines** action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes **Active** and it will be considered in price calculations.

To add new prices, on the **Prices Overview** page, use the **Add New Lines** action. The **Prices Worksheet** page opens, and you can add price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria, copying them from other price lists, or manually entering them. Afterward, you can use the **Implement Price Change** action to compare the new prices with other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

#### Create sales price lines based on the unit price

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Create new** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Product filter** field, define filters for the selected **Product Type**.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings and the unit prices from the item cards.
6. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### Create sales price lines based on existing price lists

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Copy Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Copy existing** page, select an existing price list on the **From Price List** field.
3. On the **Price Line filter** field, define filters for the products on the selected price list.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings.
7. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)  

If you want to copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To bulk update item prices, such as increase all prices by a percentage, you can fill in the Sales Price Worksheet page by using the following batch jobs:

* **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing sales prices.
  * By copying existing sales price agreements to other customers, customer price groups, or sales campaigns.

* **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing unit prices on item cards.
  * By suggesting prices for new combinations of currency, units of measure, and so on.

  This batch job doesn't change the unit prices on items.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter the adjustment in the **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for a 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, turn on the **Create New Prices** toggle.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices.
8. To implement the suggestions, use the **Implement Price Changes** action. The batch job creates suggestions but doesn't implement them. 

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## Best price calculation

After you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest price with the highest line discount allowed on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates best prices when it adds unit prices and the line discount percentages on document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. For purchases, the calculation is similar but is based on the available parameters. For example, item discount groups are not supported for purchasing.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    * Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    * Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    * Is the date within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement? For invoices and credit memos, this is the date in the **Posting Date** field on the document header. For all other documents, it's the date in the **Order Date** field on their headers.
    * Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line. It then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage using the following criteria:

    * Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    * Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if local currency would provide a better price. If there's no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in your local currency.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

## Sales invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the total amount on the invoice determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must specify certain information. You must make the following decisions:  

* Which customers will be granted this type of discount?  
* Which discount percentages you'll use?  

If you want invoice discounts to be calculated automatically, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Calc Inv. Discount** toggle.  

You can specify whether you'll grant invoice discounts when an invoice meets certain criteria for each customer. For example, when the invoice amount is large enough. Invoice discounts can be in local currency for domestic customers, or in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page for each customer. You can enter any number of percentages. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to, or instead of, a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it's a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. The structure makes it easier to determine which customers can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages you have to set up, the faster you can enter the basic information.

For training in discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

# Incoming documents

External business documents can come into your company as an email attachment or a paper copy that you scan to file. This scenario is typical of purchases, where such incoming document files represent payment receipts for expenses or small purchases.

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

## Usage scenario

You can register files or paper copies received from your trading partners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and create a document record. For example, a purchase or sales invoice, credit memo or a journal line.

Upload the received files, or use your device's camera to take a photo, and create entries to represent the external documents. Optionally, with PDF or image files, you can have an external optical character recognition (OCR) service generate electronic documents that can then be converted to records inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. Alternatively, some OCR providers offer the option of processing files forwarded to a dedicated email address, which then automatically creates a related incoming document record. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

> [!TIP]
> Create incoming document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] directly from emails sent by vendors using the Outlook add-in. To learn more, go to [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

## Incoming document features

The incoming document process can consist of the following main activities:

* Record the external documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by creating lines on the **Incoming Documents** page in the following ways:
  * Manually, either from a PC or from a mobile device, in one of the following ways:
    * Use the **Create from File** button, upload a file, and then fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page.
    * Use the **New** button, fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page and manually attach the related file.
    * From a tablet or phone, use the **Create from Camera** button to create a new incoming document record using the device's built-in camera.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To use a mobile phone, you must install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. The app is available on the App Store and on Google Play. To learn more, go to [Getting Business Central on your mobile device](install-mobile-app.md).

  * Automatically, by receiving the document from the OCR service as an electronic document after you've uploaded or emailed the related PDF or image file to an OCR service. The **Financial Information** FastTab is automatically filled on the **Incoming Document** page.
* Use an external OCR service to have PDF or image files turned into electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Create new documents or general journal lines for incoming document records by entering the information as you read it from incoming document files.
* Attach incoming document files to purchase and sales documents of any status, including to the vendor, customer, and general ledger entries that result from posting.
* View incoming document records and their attachments from any purchase and sales document or entry, or find all general ledger entries without incoming document records from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

> [!NOTE]

# Manage attachments, links, and notes on cards and documents

On most list pages, cards, and documents, you can attach files, add links, and write notes on the **Attachments** tab of the **FactBox** pane. The number in the tab title indicates how many attached files, links, or notes exist for the card or document.

On the **Lines** FastTab, you can also use the **Attachments** action to attach documents to a specific line. For example, you might want to attach design specifications to an item on a purchase invoice.

Attachments, links, and notes stay attached to the card or document while it's processed into other states. For example, from an ongoing sales order to a posted sales invoice. However, none of the attachment types are output from the system, for example, when printing or when saving to a file.

You can also add attachments to the emails you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you send an email directly from a document, such as a sales quote, the **Add file from source document** action lets you choose files that are attached to it. You can only choose files that are attached to the document. You can't choose files that are attached to lines.

> [!NOTE]
> When you partially ship and invoice a sales or purchase order, the attachment will only be attached to the final invoice of the order. Similarly, when you invoice deferrals, the attachment is attached to the G/L entries for the document but not for the deferral entries.
>
> If you delete an order before it is invoiced, the attachment is also removed.
>
> When you use the **Get Receipt Lines** action on a purchase invoice, the attachment on the related purchase order is added to the purchase invoice.

## Attach a file to a purchase invoice

You can attach any type of file, such as text, image, or video files, to a card, document, or a line on a document. This is useful, for example, when you want to store a vendor's invoice as a PDF file on the related purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached with the Incoming Documents feature aren't included on the **Attachments** tab. Learn more in [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md). The same is true for files that are attached to lines on documents.

The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your attachment is specific to a line on a document, you can attach it to the line. Select the line, and then choose the **Attachments** action.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to.
1. On the **FactBox** pane, choose the **Attachments** tab.
1. Do one of the following steps:

   - Select **Documents**, and then select **Upload files**. 
   - Select **Documents**, select **Show details**, and then select **Attach files**.
1. On the **Select files** dialog box, do one of the following steps to attach a file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The file is now attached to the purchase invoice.

## View an attached file

1. On the FactBox, select the **Attachments** tab.
1. Under **Documents**, select the attachment you want to view.

   If you select a PDF file, it opens in your browser. Other files download to your device, where you can open them.

## Save a document as a PDF attachment

Whenever you need to save a document as a file, you can use the **Attach as PDF** action to capture the current document content as a PDF file attached to the FactBox of the document. This is useful, for example, when documents follow multiple steps in a process, such as a sales process or an approval workflow, and you want to refer to a printout of the previous step.

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all supported documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a sales order, and then choose the **Attach as PDF** action.

A PDF file with the current content of the sales order is added to the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.

## To add a link from an item card

You can add a link from a card or document to any URL. This is useful, for example, when you want to link an item card with the supplier's item catalog.

The following procedure is based on an item card. The steps are similar for all other supported cards and documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item that you want to add a link from, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Links**, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Link Address** field, enter the link.

    The link must be a valid internet or intranet URL.

5. In the **Description** field, enter any information about the link.  
6. Select the **OK** button.

The link is now attached to the item card.  

## Write a note on a sales order

You can write a note on a document or card, for example, to communicate special instructions to other users of the document or card. You can include file links and URLs in notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on the **Attachments** tab aren't related to internal notes functionality, which is mainly used to communicate between workflow users. Learn more in [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to write a note on, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Notes** section, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Note** field, write any text, such as "This is an urgent order."
5. Select the **OK** button.

The note is now attached to the sales order.

# Using key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way of measuring whether or not you’re delivering on your objectives.

## Why KPIs matter

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know if your business is on the right path—or if you should change course to avoid losing valuable time and money. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

## Get started identifying your KPIs

So how do you begin to identify the KPIs that are important to your business? Start by clarifying your strategic objectives—collectively or by department.

These goals help you identify which KPIs matter for your company. Picking KPIs that are relevant depends entirely on these objectives and the ability you have to measure your performance against them.

Next, identify the KPI targets that you’re working toward, and how you measure them. Keep in mind that targets can be short and long-term.

Talk to your team and encourage open dialogue about the KPIs and their targets. Are they too aggressive? Too easy? Targets should be challenging but achievable. You should explore the activities and tactics your company uses to achieve them. Take time to understand your current state, so you have a starting point for your KPI.

## Get to know the different types of KPIs

Identifying which KPIs you should track becomes easier when you have a better understanding of the types of KPIs that are most commonly used to measure progress.

- Quantitative KPIs are all about measurable facts that can be represented with a number. Think stats, percentages, and dollar signs.
- Qualitative KPIs involve human interpretations and can’t be quantified with numbers. Think opinions, feelings, and experiences.
- Lagging KPIs measure what happened in the past to predict success or failure. Think of looking back at what you accomplished, or where you struggled.
- Leading KPIs measure performance to predict future success and long-term trends. Think of looking forward to where you’re headed.
- Leading and lagging KPIs are commonly used together. Along with quantitative and qualitative KPIs, they’re a good place to start.

For each KPI that you choose to track, assign an owner and agree on tracking frequency. Whatever KPIs you decide to track, using a KPI platform or tool is key for collaborating with your team on KPI definitions. By collectively defining each KPI, then capturing contextual data and unifying it into a single view, you enable spot-on, real-time actions.

## KPI reporting

KPI reports take the information presented on the KPI dashboard to a new level. They go deeper into the data to pull out more detailed insights and analysis.

A KPI report helps stakeholders and team members identify trends or bottlenecks over a specific time period, so that they’re able to make better decisions. Reporting subjects could include:

- Insights into the company’s day-to-day operations.
- Financial health of the company against targeted KPIs.
- Notable trends or patterns presented by the data.
- Deeper analysis of the data to assist with strategic decision-making.

To create your KPI report, first determine your audience and the objective for the report. For example, you might want to show company stakeholders Q3 progress toward your revenue target. Make sure that all the KPIs featured in your report point back to that central theme.

Other considerations for creating your KPI reports include:

- Explore KPI report templates that might already be included in your KPI tool or platform.
- Set a cadence for reporting frequency.
- Decide whether your report is static or interactive, for more dynamic drill-downs into data.
- Present only the relevant KPIs so you don’t overload the report with KPIs that don’t map back to the reporting - goals.
- Make sure your reporting is clear, easy to understand, and actionable for the intended audience.

## Tools for implementing KPIs

The following table links to articles about how to use business intelligence and reporting tools with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data to implement KPIs.

| Use the Financial Reports feature to produce financial statements and KPIs. | [Using financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs](bi.md) |
| Use Power BI to produce KPI dashboards. | [Work with Power BI reports](across-working-with-powerbi.md) | 
| [Analyze financial statements with Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md) |
| Integrate external business intelligence tools with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].| [External Business Intelligence Tools](reports-external-analysis.md) |

## KPI best practices

To help you successfully harness the power of KPIs, here are a few tips to get you started.

Identify KPIs:

- Only pick KPIs that align to your specific goals. It's difficult to match KPIs to unclear objectives.
- Use different KPIs for the same goals if they stretch across departments. For example, the marketing department has different KPIs than the sales team.
- Make sure that for whatever KPIs you pick, there’s a core team responsible for defining them.

Monitoring KPIs:

- Explore the different dashboards, visualization charts, and templates available in your KPI tool or platform. Select the right ones for your goals.
- Make sure to include starting data for comparison, so that your dashboard shows a true representation of company performance and progress over time.
- Determine a cadence for monitoring and acting on KPIs. Are KPI dashboards monitored daily or weekly? Do actions only come after reporting or are stakeholders and/or team members empowered to adjust tactics along the way?
- Be sure you have simple, end-to-end data protection for data dashboards, with controls for sharing outside the organization.

## Common KPI mistakes

Avoid these common KPI mistakes:

- Selecting KPIs that aren’t key to your strategic goals. While it’s smart to track your relevant business metrics, not all of your metrics are worthy of KPI status.
- Adopting poorly defined or vague KPIs. Collaborate with your team to define the KPIs with specific details on how they're measured. Having everyone onboard makes it easier to meet your goals.
- Setting lofty or unrealistic KPI targets. It’s better to set more realistic targets based on historical data, resources, and current tactics. Consider focusing on a specific timeframe or set short- and long-term targets.
- Tracking KPIs without owners. Accountability matters, not just for the results but also for the process. Each KPI should have an owner responsible for monitoring, reporting, analysis, and action.
- Failing to take action on your KPIs. Whether you’re meeting your goals or falling behind, KPIs are tools to help you make better decisions. So don’t track just for tracking’s sake—take action.

# FAQ for suggest item substitutions with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

In a business landscape that changes fast, companies often need to evolve the portfolio of products they sell. Whether it's adding new products, changing existing products, or adding entire product lines and categories, it's often time consuming to create and manage product (item) information.  

Reusing information from similar items can be a good option and Copilot can help you to identify similar items. An extra benefit is that suggest item substitution also reduces the risk of creating duplicated entries on the Items list page.

## What are the capabilities of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

You can store similar or interchangeable products on the **Item Substitution Entry** page. Copilot helps to add this information for current products by searching for similar ones in the database.

## What is the intended use of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

Intended to suggest item substitutions based on the description of the current item.  

Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores data doesn’t make things easier because you need to do multiple search or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

To assist you in finding items, Copilot extracts keywords, other search terms, and synonyms from the product (item) description, and uses embeddings to find similar items in the database.

## How was suggest item substitutions with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing with numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest item substitutions with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the suggest item substitutions with Copilot limitations when using the system? 

Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Suggest item substitutions only fills in the **Substitute Type**, **Substitute No.**, and **Description** fields. The **Variant Code** field isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the needed product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.  

Catalog items aren't currently supported.

The maximum number of results is currently limited to 10.

How you name your products can affect the output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For products, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|Items     | * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number        |
|Item Variants    |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>         |
|Item Reference     |* Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Attributes     |* Name<br>* Value         |
|Item Category     |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 level         |
|Item Translation     |* Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Identifier     |* Code         |
|Extend Text Line     |* Text         |

## In which geographies and languages is Suggest item substitutions available?

* Available geographies

This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for Business Central to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in item substitution page.

## What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Suggest item substitutions?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest item substitutions. Even when the feature is enabled by administrators and available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create item substitution entries? 

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert item substitution entries. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sales data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My customers" or "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sales processes:

- [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis)
- General Ledger Entries
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- Item Ledger Entries
- Posted Sales Invoices
- Sales Return Orders

## Sales ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sales scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Sales (expected sales volume)](#example-sales-expected-sales-volume) | Analyze your expected sales volume. | [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) | **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, **No.** , **Amount**, **Document Date Year**, and **Document Date Month**. |
| [Sales (Customer sales by volume)](#example-sales-customer-sales-by-volume) | Get an overview of the customers that purchase the most, or that owe the most. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Document No.**, **Amount**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Receivables)](#example-finance-accounts-receivables) | See what your customers owe you, for example, broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Due Date**, and **Remaining Amount**. |

## Example: Sales (expected sales volume)

To analyze your expected sales volume and sales amounts for unshipped orders for each customer by year or month, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Document Date Year** and **Document Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Expected sales volume** or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Example: Sales (Customer sales by volume)

To produce an overview of the customers that purchase the most or that owe the most, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list, and switch on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and the **Document No.** field below it.
1. Choose the **Amount** and **Remaining Amount** fields.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Customer by sales volume**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sales

After you enter information on a sales order and add all the sales order lines, you can post the order. Posting creates a shipment and an invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries:

- For each sales order, a sales entry is created on the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount.
- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

title: Track item cost adjustments

# Track item cost adjustments

It's important to keep item costs accurate and shorten the time between when you post an entry and when the general ledger reflects its cost. You can track the performance of the cost adjustments for individual adjustment runs and items. If errors happen, you can identify the problematic items and make corrections. For example, you can exclude the items from calculations to ensure adjustments aren't interrupted for other items. You can adjust costs for individual items or create batches of items and adjust them all at the same time.

## Start tracking cost adjustments

It's easy to get started. On the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Cost Adjustment Logging** field offers a few options:

* **Disabled** means you don't log cost adjustment runs.
* **Errors Only** means you log only runs that failed.
* **All** means you log all runs.

> [!NOTE]
> To minimize the size of the log, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't log the adjustments that happen automatically when someone posts an item.

You must also set up the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. This job queue entry automatically adjusts costs according to a schedule. To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Manage cost adjustments

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process.

### About item batches

You can run cost adjustments for several items by grouping them into batches. Batches make it easy to adjust some items separately, for example, because they take longer to adjust. Batches can also help identify items that have issues.

To create a batch, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page:

* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add Batch**.

To create a batch and run cost adjustment immediately:
* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add batch and run**.
* Choose **Run cost adjustment**, choose **Item Batches**, and then enter a filter in the **Item Filter** field.
  
> [!TIP]
> To quickly create another batch for all items that aren't already included in a batch, on the **Cost Adjustment - Item Batches** page, choose **Add Missing Items**.

When a run for a batch finishes, the batch has one of the following status on the **Item Batches** page:

* **Success**: The cost adjustment is successful.
* **Failed**: If the cost adjustment fails, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies the item that caused the error and then splits the current batch into two. One batch with the problematic item, and another with the remaining items. Cost adjustment reruns for the batch with the remaining items. If it fails again, the process repeats. You define the maximum number of splits in the **Max. Retry Attempts** field. The default value for retries is 10, but you can enter a new limit.
* **Timed out**: If the cost adjustment for a batch doesn't finish within the period specified in the **Timeout (Minutes)** field (ranging from 1 to 720 minutes), the session terminates and changes are rolled back. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then splits the current batch in half and reruns the cost adjustment process for each half. This process continues until the cost adjustment is successful or reaches the maximum retry attempts.

> [TIP!]
> Each batch runs in a separate session. To monitor progress, use the **Refresh** action.

### Run cost adjustment

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to make adjustments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Cost Adjustment**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on what you want to do, use one of the following options:

  * For one or more items immediately, select the items in the list and then choose **Run cost adjustment**.
  * For batches, use one of the following options:

    * To create a batch and adjust costs immediately, choose the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then **Add batch and run**.
    * To run it for all batches, choose **Run cost adjustment**, **Item Batches**, and then choose **Run**. To learn more about batches, go to [About item batches](#about-item-batches).
  * For all items on an item-by-item basis, which saves the results after each item is processed. For example, this option is useful for handling a large number of items, reducing lock times, and preventing full reruns if something goes wrong. To use this option, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** report, and turn on the **Item-by-Item Adjustment** toggle.

### Explore item details

Use the **Item** menu to access information about cost adjustments for a selected item.

* **Item Ledger Entries**: List item entries for the item. The **Mark for Adjustment** action lets you force the rerun of cost adjustment for items directly or indirectly linked to the inbound entries you select. Forcing a rerun can be helpful if previous runs led to incorrect costs.
* **Value Entries**: List value entries for the item.
* **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points**: Open the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** page, which you primarily use to calculate average cost. The page displays combinations of items, locations, variants, and valuation dates for which cost adjustments are, or must be, run.
* **Cost Adjmt. Orders**: Open the **Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)** page, where you adjust production and assembly orders. It shows the orders are adjusted or require adjustment.
* **Item Application Entries**: Open the **Item Application Entries** page for details about quantity and cost applications. You can use the **Reset Outbound Entry is Updated** action in combination with the **Mark for Adjustment** setting on the **Item Ledger Entries** page to force a rerun of cost adjustment.

### View the outcome

Use the **Log per** menu to view the outcome of cost adjustments:

* **Run**: Show cost adjustment logs for each run. The log includes data about the item filter, status (Success/Failed/Timed out), start and end date/time, duration, and the cost differences produced by the run.
* **Item**: Show detailed information about the adjustment process for the selected item.

### Include or exclude items from adjustments

If one or more items fail, you can exclude the items from the adjustment run and then include them in later runs. On the **Functions** menu, choose one of the following:

* **Exclude item from adjustment** and **Include item in adjustment**: Temporarily disable and then re-enable cost adjustment for a selected item. Cost adjustment continues to keep costs accurate for other items while you investigate an issue with a specific item.

### Use iterative cost adjustments

To manage the processing scope of cost adjustments for items that have a high volume of transactions, you can do the adjustments on a period-by-period basis. You can do that in just a few steps. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select the item to adjust, choose the **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points** action. Next, choose the **Valuation Date** until you want to complete the adjustment and then choose the **Adjust Cost Until Valuation Date** action.

These steps adjust entries for the selected item up to the chosen date and affects entries across all locations and variants. The item is marked as adjusted when all periods are fully adjusted.

You can also adjust costs for individual production and assembly orders. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select one or more production or assembly orders, and then choose the **Adjust Cost for Selected Orders** action.

## Post adjusted costs to the general ledger

Typically, new value entries are posted to the general ledger according to the schedule for the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. However, you can post adjustments to the general ledger immediately from the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page. On the **Functions** menu, choose **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

## Troubleshoot cost adjustments

Use the following options on the **Diagnostics** menu to troubleshoot cost adjustment runs.

* **Export item data**: Export item-related data to a text file. You can use the file for further analysis in a sandbox environment or attach it to a support request when investigating costing calculation issues.
* **Import item data**: Import the previously exported text file back into the database. This action is only enabled in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.
* **Reset Cost Is Adjusted**: Reset the **Cost Is Adjusted** toggle on items, production orders, or assembly orders. This setting allows you to force the rerun of the cost adjustment for them.
* **Costing Issues Detection report**: Diagnose typical data issues cause calculation errors in costing. It checks whether the item ledger entries, value entries, item application entries, and capacity ledger entries are correct.
* **Delete item data**: Clear all item-related tables in the database. This action is only available in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.

### Self-diagnostics for potential issues and performance pitfalls

During posting and cost adjustment, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] scans the current setup and data to identify inefficiencies that might affect the accuracy and performance of cost adjustment.

When you open the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, a notification might state that issues were found. You can view the issues on the **Action Messages** page by selecting **Action Messages** in the **Diagnostics** section.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] issues warnings in the following scenarios:

* Cost adjustment isn't set for automatic runs or run manually.
* Average cost adjustment settings aren't optimal for performance.
* Inventory periods aren't in use.
* Many periods require adjustment.
* Many production and assembly orders require adjustment.
* Cost adjustment for a single item takes more than five minutes to complete.
* One or more items are excluded from cost adjustment.
* Data discrepancies remain after cost adjustment completes.

Scanning happens automatically during normal system usage, but you can start it manually at any time by selecting the **Run Tests** action on the **Cost Adjmt. Action Messages** page. You can't turn off diagnostics completely but you can pause it for up to 30 days by choosing **Snooze for 30 days**.

## Use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature

Cost adjustment can take time to complete. For example, due to a high volume of entries, data errors, or a setup that isn't optimal. Because the cause is often unclear, you can use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature to gain visibility and get some help to diagnose data-related issues.

To use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, choose **Item Batches**. Create a batch for one or more items, fill in the **Timeout (minutes)** field, select the **Trace** checkbox, and then choose the **Run** action.

During the cost adjustment process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records AL events, items, locations, variants, entries, and orders it processes. When the cost adjustment completes or reaches the specified time-out, it saves the results in the **Trace Log**. To access the recorded details, select **Trace Log**. Due to the potentially large volume of log entries, we recommend that you turn on the **Analysis View** mode to summarize the data.

# Sales analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for sales managers:

- Opportunities
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders
- Sales invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's sales data:

- Power BI reports for sales
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in sales analytics tools
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain sales insights.

## Analytics needs in sales

When you think about the analytics needs in sales management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CCO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Sales Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Account Manager / Sales Person | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their sales organization's performance:

- Gross Profit
- Gross Profit Margin
- Sales by period
- Sales vs. budget
- Number of new customers
- Period-over-Period Sales Amount Growth
- Sales by item/customer/location/sales person

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png":::

These sales KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Sales app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI sales app](sales-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app](includes/power-bi-sales-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to sales

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for sales management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track sales postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities related to sales

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for sales management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your sales accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, or **Posted Invoices**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on sales data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of sales data](ad-hoc-analysis-sales.md).

## Built-in reports for sales

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help sales organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [sales_reports_report_explorer](includes/sales-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen sales analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you sales overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Open the Sales Quotes list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9300)
- [Open the Sales Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- [Open the Posted Sales Invoices list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143)
- [Open the Sales Return Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9304)
- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)
- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Blanket sales order status](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-the-status-of-a-blanket-sales-order)
- [View unposted and posted blanket sales order lines](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-unposted-and-posted-blanket-sales-order-lines)

### Show sales-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for sales, you can create a view that only shows the accounts you use for posting sales entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to sales)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Change basic settings

Use the **My Settings** page to manage basic settings for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The changes you make only affect your workspace, not the workspaces of other users.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="role-center"></a>Role

The role determines the home page, a starting screen that is designed for the needs of a specific role in an organization. Depending on your role, the home page, or Role Center, gives you an overview of the business, your department, or your personal tasks. It also helps you go to your daily tasks and find work that's assigned to you.

* At the top of your home page, you can switch between customers, vendors, items, and other important lists of information. Similarly, actions allow you to initiate tasks, such as creating a new sales invoice, directly from the home page.

* In the center, you find the **Activities** area, which shows current data and can be selected to view more detailed information. Key performance indicators (KPIs) can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of favorite customers on the home page for business accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

### Change the role

The default role is **Business Manager**, but you can select another role to use a role center that fits your needs better.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Role** field, select the role that you want to use by default. For example, select **Accountant**.
3. Choose **OK**.

## <a name="company"></a>Company

A company functions as a container for data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. There can be multiple companies in a database, but only one can be selected at a time. The default company is called CRONUS and contains demonstration data only.

The **Company** field shows the company you're currently working in, and you can use it to switch to another company. The company name is always displayed at the upper-left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center.

> [!TIP]
> You can also change the company by using the company switcher (Crtl+O). For more information about about this feature and other ways to change company or environment, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

The default company is called CRONUS and contains demonstration data only. You can create a new company with custom data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies](about-new-company.md).

<!--
### To change the company name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. The system restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

### <a name="badge"></a>To display a company badge for quick access to company information

You can add a customized badge in the top-right corner, which you can choose to quickly view company name and tenant information in a pop-up box. The company badge is also useful when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is embedded in another application, like Microsoft Teams or in some other web application. In these cases, because the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] displays less surrounding contextual information, the company badge serves as the only way to determine which company or environment a record belongs to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> If a company badge is defined, then you cannot change the company name as described in [To change the company name](ui-change-basic-settings.md#to-change-the-company-name)-->

## <a name="work-date"></a>Work date

The most commonly used work date is today's date. You might have to temporarily change the work date to be able to perform tasks, such as completing transactions for a date that isn't today.

> [!TIP]  
> In all date fields, type **t** to quickly enter today's date, and type **w** to quickly enter the work date, which is the value in the **Work Date** field on the **My Settings** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After you change the work date, if you sign out or switch to another company, the work data reverts to the default work date. So the next time you sign in or switch back to the original company, you may have to set the work date again.

### Work date indication

The work date is critical on pages that can be edited. Whenever the work date isn't set to today's date on an editable page, then two types of indicators appear on the page:

* A reminder appears at the top of the page that tells you what the work date is set to. The reminder provides a direct link to the work date setting on the **My Settings** page so you change the date if you want. From the reminder, you can also choose to dismiss the reminder for the rest of your session. Unless you change the work date to "today," the reminder will appear the next time you sign in.

* If you dismiss the reminder, the work date appears in the title of the page.  

If the work date isn't set to the current day (today), then on all pages where you can edit data, the current work date appears in the upper-left corner.

## <a name="region"></a> Region

The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted. It also determines what character is used as the decimal separator when using a numeric keyboard to enter data. Learn more at [Entering Data](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).

## <a name="language"></a> Language

Changes the display language. This field appears only when there's more than one language to choose from.

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], your administrator or your browser settings determine the initial language. The language that you set is used on all devices that you sign in from, such as a phone or tablet.

You can install more languages for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from AppSource. While all supported display languages are shown in the list, the administrator must install the relevant language app to the tenant before users can switch to the new language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Allowed Languages** page, administrators can modify the list of languages that shows when people select their language and region. Administrators can show only the languages for which they know a language app is installed. Keeping the list of languages short and accurate makes it easier for people to choose a supported language. To learn more about allowed languages, go to [Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment](admin-allowed-languages.md).

## Time zone

Defines the time zone where you're located. When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the time zone is set based on your company's address. Change it if it doesn't fit your physical location.  

## Notifications

Choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link to manage the notifications that you get about certain events or status changes. For example, such as when you're about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you're about to sell. Learn more at [Managing Notifications](ui-smart-notifications.md).

# General Business Functionality

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. For more information, see [Business Functionality](across-business-functionality.md).

To support those business area-specific tasks, you can use various general business functionalities, such as defining extended text for document lines and organizing connecting business tasks in workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the business-related functions described in this section, you will use general UI functions every day to interact with the system. For more information, see [Work with Business Central](ui-work-product.md).

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The following table lists these general business areas with links to articles that describe them.

# Posting sales

Under the **Posting** menu in a sales document, you can choose between the following posting functions:

* **Post**
* **Post and New**
* **Post and Send**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post Batch**
* **Test Report**

> [!NOTE]
> For sales orders, you can also see options related to the prepayments functionality. For more information, see [Invoicing Prepayments](finance-invoice-prepayments.md).

When you have completed all the lines and entered all the information on the sales order, you can post it. This creates a shipment and an invoice.

When a sales order is posted, the customer's account, the general ledger, and the item ledger entries are updated.

For each sales order, a sales entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

For each sales order line, an item ledger entry will be created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry will be created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition to this, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

You can either post, or post and send. If you choose to post and send, a PDF file is generated that you can then send. You can also choose the **Post Batch** function, which lets you post several orders at the same time. For more information, see [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted sales lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. After this, you'll be able to see the posted entries in the various pages that contain posted entries, such as the **Cust. Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Posted Sales Shipments**, and **Posted Sales Invoices** pages.  

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Package Tracking No.** field. For more information, see [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Review the purchase order lines, and in the **Vendor No.** field, select the vendor that supplies the goods.
5. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action to convert the lines to a purchase order.

## To view the linked purchase order from the sales order

Select the drop-shipment sales order line, choose the **Order** action, choose the **Drop Shipment** action, and then choose the **Purchase Order** action.

## To post a drop shipment

After the vendor ships the items, you can post the sales order as shipped. You can also post the purchase order, but only with the **Receive** option until the sales order has been invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales order that you created in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
3. In the **Qty. to Ship** field, specify how many of the order quantity to ship, the full or a partial order quantity.
4. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Send** action.
5. Choose either the **Ship** option to invoice later, or the **Ship and Invoice** option to invoice immediately.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget that you need to post the purchase order invoice.

# Add Companies to Your Company Hub

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

With the company hub, you can access your work from across multiple companies from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. You can add a environments and companies manually, if your companies do not show up automatically in the company hub.  

Right in the company hub landing page, you find the **Setup** menu, from where you can access the **Environment Links** page. Simply choose **New**, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect the company hub to as many companies as you need. However, you can only connect the company hub to companies that are hosted in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Environment links

An environment link is a card where you specify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that hosts one or more companies that you do work in. The data in the card for each environment is specified by you, and you can change it as needed. However, the **Environment Link** field is critical - this is how you can access each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Test the connection** action in the ribbon to test that you entered the right link. The link that you must enter points at environment that hosts the company that you are adding, and it must include the Microsoft Entra ID, or the organization's domain name. For example, if they have specified a domain such as MyBusiness.com, then the link to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/mybusiness.com?redirectedfromsignup=1```. Otherwise, it will look something like this: ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```  

The link is used when you choose the company in the company hub.  

:::image type="content" source="media/company-hub-company-list-actions.png" alt-text="Actions for a company that is listed in the company hub.":::

> [!TIP]
> If you're working in the free trial version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it is easy to add the companies in your tenant. You can find the environment link by copying the ID for Microsoft Entra from the **Troubleshooting** section of the Help & Support page. The environment name is probably the default value, PRODUCTION. Add this information to the **Environment Link** field, such as ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```, and then choose **Test the connection**. The evaluation company will be added to the list.
>
> If you have moved to the thirty-day trial company, My Company, you can add that to the list by choosing the **Reload / Reload all Companies** action in the list.

## Load companies

When you have added your environments, your companies show up automatically. However, if you know that a new company has been added to an environment, you can choose the **Reload all companies** action to refresh the list. Use the same action to refresh data from across your companies.  

> [!TIP]
> In order to refresh the data in the company hub, you must have access to the data in the companies that the data comes from.

# Inspecting pages in Business Central

The page inspection feature enables you to get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection is especially designed for administrators, power users, support personnel, and developers. It's ideal for learning the data model behind a page and troubleshooting. For example, if you're experiencing a problem with a page, you can use page inspection to get information to pass on to your system administrator or support personnel.

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, through page inspection, you can start Visual Studio Code from within the web client to further investigate and debug source code of an extension. For more information, see [Troubleshoot in Visual Studio Code directly from the web client](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-troubleshoot-vscode-webclient) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)]

## Work with page inspection

You start page inspection from the **Help & Support** page. Choose the question mark in the top right corner, choose **Help & Support**, and then choose **Inspect pages and data**. Or, you can just use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>.

The **Page inspection** pane opens on the side. When the pane first opens, it shows information that pertains to the main page object.

Use the keyboard or pointing device to move focus to different elements on the page. When you select a FactBox or a part on the main page, the bounding area is highlighted by a border, and the **Page Inspection** pane shows information about the selected element. For example, the previous figure shows information about the list part in the **Sales Order** page. As you navigate to other pages in the application, the **Page Inspection** pane will automatically update with page information as you move along.

For more information about what is shown in page inspection, see [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

If you don't see the details that you expect to see in the **Page Inspection** pane, you probably don't have the required permissions, as described in the next section.

## Controlling access to page inspection details

As an administrator, you can control access to the full details that are shown in the **Page Inspection** pane by configuring the permissions that users have. To grant a user permission to the full details, give users **Execute** permission on the **System** object **5330**. You can grant this permission by using a permission set (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**) or a user group (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**). For more information about permissions, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

Users who aren't granted permissions on **System object 5330** can still access the **Page Inspection** pane, but they will only see the **Page** and **Table** fields, which display basic details that they can pass on to their support team.

# Daily Sales (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Daily Sales** report gives a clear picture of your organization's sales activities over specific days. The report can showcase which days have a higher volume of sales. You can also view variations across different years, quarters, or months to identify trends over time.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Sales Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps executives and managers track daily sales metrics.

Executives can use the report to identify high performing days and ensure you're staying on track on a daily basis. For example, this analysis can help you make informed decisions in regards to staffing allocations per day.

As a sales manager, this report helps you identify which days are high performing and compare them against your sales people.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPI) and measures:

- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)

# Multiple VAT registration numbers 

For businesses with warehouses in multiple EU countries, managing VAT (Value Added Tax) can be challenging, as each warehouse location requires a different VAT number to comply with the specific regulations of each country. This article provides information about this requirement and explains the functionality for multiple value-added tax (VAT) registration numbers. This functionality allows users to set up tax registration numbers for their customers in different countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]
> The *Multiple VAT numbers for customers* functionality is available only from Business Central 2024 release wave 2 (version 25).

## How to set up the alternative VAT registration numbers  

To set up the alternative VAT registration numbers for different countries/regions, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, and then select the related link. 
2. Add the customer in the **Customer No** field and the country/region related to this VAT registration in the **VAT Country/Region Code**.  
3. You must add the VAT number in the **VAT Registration No.** field. You must stick to the format when you use **Country/Region Code**. 
4. If you want to use different VAT or general posting groups, you can alternatively add them to the setup in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields. 
5. Close the page.   

To create an alternative address for your customer, follow these steps:  

1. Open the **Customer** card for the customer you want to add new **Ship-to Address**. 
2. Select **Customer**, and choose the **Ship-to Addresses** action.   
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page opens, and select **New**. 
4. Fill in the information about your customer's ship-to destination.  
5. Choose the proper **Country/Region Code**.   
6. If you have already configured a new **VAT Registration No.** on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, nothing will happen. 
  - But if you didn't configure the **VAT Registration No.** previously on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, the following notification appears: **Click Add if you want to insert the Alternative VAT Registration for this Ship-To Country Code.**
  - Choose the **Add** action on the notification and the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page opens.
This page populates your **Customer No.** and the **VAT Country/Region Code**. So, you just need to add the setup that you want to use. 

## Work with the sales documents   

You can create new [sales invoice](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [sales order](sales-how-sell-products.md) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to use a ship-to address that differs from the customer's address and is located in a different country, follow the steps:  

### Alternate shipping address  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option. 
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page with available alternate addresses appears. 
4. Choose one of the addresses with a different **Country/Region Code**. 
5. The **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that you have modified because of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup change. 
6. Select **OK** to confirm.   

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to confirm such a choice anymore, you can select the **Don't show again** field, and in the future you won't see this type of notification about changes. But if you want to enable it again, you can do it by enabling the **Confirm Alternative VAT Registration** field on the **VAT Setup**.  
   
7. Once you confirm, the values are overwritten with the values from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You can check all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  
8. Post the document.  

### Custom address  

In case you don't have the ship-to address configured but still want to use a different address for shipping, you can use this option.  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Custom Address** option.  
3. Change the country in the **Country/Region** field.  
4. Once you change the country/region code to match the **VAT Country/Region Code** of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that have been changed. 
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will also change all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  

### Work with no shipment 

If there's no shipment as a process, you still can leverage the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup.

In the sales order or invoice, you can find the **VAT Country/Region Code** under the **Invoice Details** FastTab and specify the value that matches the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You should see the same confirmation dialog page as above. 

In this situation, you can post a sales invoice with the proper **VAT Registration No.** for your customer even if you don't ship items with this document. 

### Work with the sales credit memo  

Once you post the invoice with a **Ship-to address** or **VAT Country/Region Code** that has different posting data, the corrective **Sales credit memo** takes the values from the **Posted sales invoice** header where these values are taken from the **Alternative customer VAT registration**, so no other actions required.

# Released Production Orders (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Released Production Orders** report provides detailed information about all released production orders, including expected versus finished quantities and the variance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Released Production Orders Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track released production orders. By analyzing the expected versus finished quantities, you can find issues that might affect the production process. For example, if the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, it might indicate a problem with the manufacturing process or materials. By identifying and addressing these issues, you can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor expected and finished quantities. This information helps you prioritize and schedule the next items for production. For example, if the finished quantity is close to the expected quantity, you can prioritize the next item for production. If the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, you might need to adjust the production schedule to ensure you compete the order on time.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Released Production Orders* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-quantity-base)
- [Finished Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#finished-quantity-base)
- [Qty. Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-variance)

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices, to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** check box.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

The status of the price list must be **Draft**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  
  
---

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter adjustment in **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** field.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected **Item**.  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them in the **Sales Prices** table, you can use the **Implement Price Changes** batch job, which is found on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

### Get an overview of the chart of accounts

If you need a more compact view of the chart of accounts, without columns for posting groups, posting type, or cost type, for example, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** lists the main information for each account in a smaller table. Additionally, you can collapse or expand groups to hide the accounts inside them.

To display the overview, choose the **Chart of Accounts Overview** action on the **Chart of Accounts** page, or search for the feature using ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do").

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# Report selection for documents in Business Central

You can set up default reports to use to print sales, purchases, and service documents, such as orders, quotes, and invoices, and which layout is used. For example, if you have a specific layout for sales invoices, you can specify that report in the **Report Selections - Sales** page. You can then use the report when you send or print sales invoices.  

## Available report selections

The **Report Selections** pages specify the reports to print in different situations and the layout to use. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides default configurations, but you can change them if needed. You can also add reports to the **Report Selection** pages if you want to print more than one report per document type, for example.

The following table describes where you can find information about the different pages.  

|Area or task  |Learn more|

|Define reports for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Germany)|[Set Up Reports for VAT and Intrastat](LocalFunctionality/Germany/how-to-set-up-reports-for-vat-and-intrastat.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can include additional **Report Selection** pages, depending on your location and industry, for example. To check your setup, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selection**, then choose the relevant link.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following **Report Selection** pages:

* **Report Selection - Sales**  
* **Report Selection - Project**  
* **Report Selection - Service**
* **Report Selection - Purchase**  
* **Report Selection - Cash Flow**  
* **Report Selection - Warehouse**  
* **Report Selection - Inventory**  
* **Report Selection - Bank Account**  
* **Report Selection - Production Order**  
* **Report Selection - Reminder/Finance Charge**  

## Example: Report selection for sales documents

The **Report Selection - Sales** page offers default reports to use in different scenarios for each related document type. Choose a document type in the **Usage** field, then add or review the report selection. You can set up more than one report and specify the sequence the reports must be sent or printed in.  

[!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can't send all document types as email attachments. For the document types you can, the **Report Selection** page contains extra fields.  

For example, on the **Report Selection - Sales** and **Report Selection - Purchase** pages, the following fields help you set up email:

|Field name |Description  |
|-----------|-------------|
|**Use for Email Body**| Insert summarized information, such as the invoice number, due date, or a link to a payment service in an email.|
|**Use for Email Attachment**| Attach the related document to the email.|
|**Email Body Layout Description**|Specify the email body layout to use. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |
|**Report Layout**|Specify the layout to use for the report. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

# Record purchases with purchase invoices and orders

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Purchase invoices and purchase orders are also used to dynamically update inventory levels, meaning you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices or orders, contribute to profit figures and financial key performance indicators (KPIs) in your Role Center.

## Record purchases with purchase invoices

When you receive the inventory items or the purchased service is complete, post the purchase invoice to update inventory and financial records and to activate payment to the vendor according to the payment terms. [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

> [!CAUTION]  
> Do not post a purchase invoice for physical items until you receive the items and know the final cost of the purchase, including any additional charges. Otherwise, your inventory value and profit figures may be skewed.

### Create and post a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to create a purchase invoice. The steps for creating a purchase order are similar. The main difference is that purchase orders have some extra fields and actions for physical handling of items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**,  then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with standard information for the selected vendor. If the vendor isn't registered, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of the new vendor.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new vendor, choose **Yes**.
    3. To learn more on how to fill in the vendor card, go to [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  
    4. When you complete the vendor card, choose **OK** to return to the **Purchase Invoice** page.

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You're now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources purchased from the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up recurring purchase lines for the vendor, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the invoice by choosing the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or a service.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amount are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you select in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the vendor card.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

6. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up invoice discounts for the vendor, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Vendor Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met. The related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field.
7. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices. For more information on what happens when you post purchase documents, see [Posting Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

> [!NOTE]
> In rare cases, the posted amounts may deviate from what is displayed in the totals fields. This is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
>
> To check the amounts that will actually be posted, go to the **Statistics** page, which takes the rounding calculations into account. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields will be updated to include rounding calculations.

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice before you pay the vendor. For example, if you need to correct a typo or change the purchase early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). To reverse a purchase for items or services on a posted purchase invoice for which the payment is processed, create a purchase credit memo. Learn more at [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

[Open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Purchasing noninventory items

The lines on a purchase invoice can be of the **Resource** or **Item** type. Item cards can be further classified as of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type, which specifies if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit (also applicable for resources), or a physical unit that isn't kept in inventory. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The purchase invoice process is the same for all mentioned types.

> [!NOTE]
> With the **Resource** purchase line type, you can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. Learn more at [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).
>
> To use a purchased resource, you may need to set the resource's capacity and manually assign it to a project. Purchasing a resource creates a resource ledger entry; however, resource ledger entries are not tracked for quantity and value as, for example, items are. If quantity and value tracking is required, then consider using other line item types.

## When to use purchase orders

Use purchase orders if you need to record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity isn't available at the vendor. If you deliver sold items directly from your vendor to your customer as a drop shipment, you must also use purchase orders. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).

In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same as purchase invoices. The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for a purchase order.

<br><br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=f04b1ed3-5cb0-4fa8-8cd0-24069ee893d2]

## Receive items with a purchase order

The following steps describe how to receive items with a purchase order. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Open an existing purchase order, or create a new one.
3. In the **Qty. to Receive** field, enter the received quantity.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the received quantity is more than the quantity on the purchase order, and the vendor has been set up to allow over-receipts, use the **Over-Receive** field to handle the excess quantity. Learn more in the [To receive more items than you ordered](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#receive-more-items-than-you-ordered) section.
4. Choose the **Post** action.

  The value in the **Qty. Received** field is updated. If this receipt is partial, the value is lower than the value in the **Quantity** field.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a warehouse handling, you can't use the **Post** action on the purchase order to register receipt. That's because a warehouse employee has already posted the purchase order quantity as received. Learn more at [Design Details - Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## Receive more items than you ordered

When more goods arrive than were ordered, you might want to receive them instead of canceling the receipt. For example, it might be cheaper to keep the excess items in inventory than return them, or your vendor might offer a discount for keeping them.

The following video shows how to work with over-receipts.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=61ce06f8-b3e7-42fd-b332-85f09d65a4e1]

<!--move the over-receipt setup info to an article about purchasing. Keep the concept info here and link to the steps-->
### Set up over-receipts

Create over-receipt codes to define a percentage by which a received quantity can exceed the ordered quantity. Specify the percentage in the **Over-Receipt Tolerance %** field. You then assign the code on the Item Card or Vendor Card pages for items and vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Over-Receipt Codes**, then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Assign the over-receipt code to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Item Card** page for the item.
3. In the **Over-Receipt Code** field, choose the code that contains the percentage you want to allow for over-receipts.

The over-receipt code is assigned to the item. Purchase orders or warehouse receipts for the item now allow you to receive more than the ordered quantity within the over-receipt tolerance percentage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up an approval workflow requiring over-receipts to be approved before they can be handled. Select the **Approval Required** checkbox on the **Over-Receipt Codes** page. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

### Over-receive an order

On purchase lines and warehouse receipt lines, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field is used to record over-received quantities, meaning quantities exceeding the ordered-quantity value in the **Quantity** field.

When you handle an over-receipt, you can increase the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field to the quantity received. The **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the excess quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the excess quantity in the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field. The **Qty. to Receive** field updates to show the ordered quantity plus the excess quantity. The following procedure described how to fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field.  

1. On a purchase order or a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field.

    If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded.

    If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed. Investigate whether another over-receipt code allows it. Otherwise, only the ordered quantity can be received, and the excess quantity must be handled another way, such as returning it to the vendor.

2. Post the receipt as you would any other receipt.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not automatically handle financial aspects of over-receipts. You must manually handle this in agreement with the vendor, for example, by the vendor forwarding a new or updated invoice.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Posting purchases

On a purchase document, you can choose between the following posting actions:

* **Post**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post and Print**
<!--* **Test Report**-->
* **Post Batch**

When a purchase document is posted, the vendor's account, the general ledger (G/L), the item ledger entries, and the resource ledger entries are updated.

For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Vendor Ledger Entry** table and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase can result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:

* **Item Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Item** type.
* **G/L Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **G/L Account** type.
* **Resource Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Resource** type.

In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

You can always review various ledger entries that are created as a result of postings. Choose **Preview Posting** to validate document and inspect expected ledger entries.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you post a purchase order for items, you can create both a receipt and an invoice. These can be done simultaneously or independently. You can also create a partial receipt and a partial invoice by completing the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual purchase order lines before you post. Note that you cannot create a purchase invoice from a purchase order for products or services that have not been received. That is, before you can invoice, you must have recorded a receipt, or you must choose to receive and invoice at the same time.

You can either post or post and print. If you choose to post and print, a report is printed when the order is posted. You can also choose the **Post Batch** action to post several orders at the same time. Learn more at [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted purchase lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. Afterward, the posted entries are available on various pages, including the **Vendor Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Resource Ledger Entries**, **Purchase Receipts**, and **Posted Purchase Invoices** pages.

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Payment Reference** field. Learn more at [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Add Comments to Cards and Documents

You can add extra information to G/L accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate exceptions or special agreements to other users.
Practically all cards and document have a **Comments** action, which opens the **Comment Sheet** page where you can write or read comments. On documents, you can also add comments to individual lines.

Comments on ongoing documents are transferred to the related posted document. For example, a comment on a sales order is transferred to a resulting posted sales shipment.

In addition, you can specify if you want comments to be transferred from one type of document to another resulting type of document, such as from a sales order to a sales invoice. You do this in the **Sales & Receivables** and the **Purchases & Payables** pages respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments are not printed or output to reports or externally-facing documents.

The following describes how to add a comment to an item card. The steps are similar for all other cards and documents, except on document lines, the **Comments** action is placed on a lines action menu.

## To add a comments to an item card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. On the **Comment Sheet** page, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Create recurring sales

If you often need to create sales lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring sales documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.  

## Set up recurring sales lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Sales Lines**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter information in the fields to prepare sales lines that reflect the standard lines that you expect to use as recurring lines on sales documents.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring sales lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual sales documents after you insert the recurring sales lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring sales lines to a customer

Assign one or more recurring sales lines to a customer so that they are available to insert on sales documents for that customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant customer.
3. Select **Related** and **Sales**
4. Choose the **Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, select codes for the recurring sales lines that you want to be able to insert on sales documents for the customer.
6. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring sales lines are to be used.  

    If you plan to use the recurring sales lines set together with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job, use the **Valid From Date** and **Valid To Date** fields to restrict when the recurring sales lines are used for creation of invoices. For more information, see [Create multiple sales invoices based on standard sales lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md#create-multiple-sales-invoices-based-on-recurring-sales-lines).

    You can also specify a direct-debit payment method and a direct-debit mandate. The sales invoices that are created with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job will then include the information required to collect payment with SEPA direct debit. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

7. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on four document types, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring sales line that exists for the customer.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring sales line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Sales Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a customer card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring sales lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring sales lines on a sales invoice

If recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you can insert them, or have them inserted, on all types of sales documents, such as a sales invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring sales lines to customers, you'll be informed if recurring sales lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to insert one or more standard sales lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard sales lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard sales lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

## Create multiple sales invoices based on recurring sales lines

You can use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to standard sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the standard sales lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Recurring Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **Code** filter field, enter the code for standard sales lines that are assigned to a customer that you want to create sales invoices for.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

Sales invoices are created for the customers with the specified standard customer sales code, and any specified direct-debit information, for posting on the specified date.

# Design details: table structure

To understand how dimension entries are stored and posted, it's important to understand the table structure.  

## Table 480, Dimension Set Entry  

You can't change this table. After data is written to the table, you can't delete or edit it.

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**ID**|Integer|>0.0 is reserved for the empty dimension set. References field 3 in table 481.|  
|2|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|3|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|4|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349. It's the secondary key that is used when traversing table 481.|  
|5|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|6|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Table 481, Dimension Set Tree Node  
You can't change this table. It's used to search for a dimension set. If the dimension set isn't found, a new set is created.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Parent Dimension Set ID**|Integer|0 for top level node.|  
|2|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|Table relation to field 12 in table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used in field 1 in table 480.|  
|4|**In Use**|Boolean|False if not in use.|  

## Table 482 Reclas. Dimension Set Buffer  
This table is used when you change a dimension value code, for example, on an item ledger entry by using the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|2|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|4|**New Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|5|**New Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|6|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|7|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  
|8|**New Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Transaction and Budget Tables  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, this field is important:  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 83, Item Journal Line  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  
|481|**New Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 349, Dimension Value  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|12|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used for references in table 480 and table 481.|  

### Tables That Contain the Dimension Set ID Field
 The **Dimension Set ID** field (480) exists in the following tables. For the tables that store posted data, the field only provides a noneditable display of dimensions, which is marked as Drill-down. For the tables that store working documents, the field is editable. The buffer tables that are used internally don't need editable or noneditable capabilities.

# Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Customer** report gives a clear picture of your organization's customers and their sales activities. It highlights key metrics for each customer, such as sales amount and quantities along with the costs associated. You can break down the metrics by the specific items that are sold per customer to identify key trends.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png":::

## Use the report

This report is meant for all users to identify key customers and other customers that buy less than expected.

A COO can quickly identify a list of the top customers generating revenue for the company. You can easily identify which customers are generating the most revenue and how much each customer is contributing to your company's overall revenue. This information helps you make informed decisions and can provide valuable insights to the CFO regarding where the revenue is coming from.

A business development manager can quickly identify how you're attracting new customers to purchase from your organization. You can break down the metrics to find out how salespeople are performing. This information can then translate into what a sales manager would want to see, and enable them to track how sales are going for different salespeople.

For salespeople, the report you help can tailor your onsite visits to your customers based on their recent purchases. This report can also show you insights into specific period trends for this customer, and identify opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages

Before you start using sales opportunities, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. A sales cycle is made up of a series of stages that go from the initial contact to the closing of a sale. For each stage, you define any requirements that must be met, such as requiring a sales quote, before an opportunity can go to the next stage. You can also specify whether a stage can be skipped. You can set up as many sales cycles as you need. You can set up as many sales cycle stages as necessary within a sales cycle.

To use opportunity sales cycles, you must set up the sales cycle, define the different stages of the cycle, and then assign the cycle to opportunities. Assigning the relevant activity or tasks to the opportunity may also be part of setting up a sales cycle.

This article also describes how to set up tasks and activities, and how to assign tasks to activities. For more information, see [To set up activities with tasks](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md#to-set-up-activities-with-tasks).

## To set up opportunity sales cycle codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Cycles**, and then choose the related link. The **Sales Cycles** page opens, and lists all the existing sales cycles.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Repeat these steps to set up as many sales cycles as you want. After you have set up opportunity sales cycles, you may want to set up the different stages within each cycle.

## To define opportunity sales cycle stages

1. On the **Sales Cycles** page, select the opportunity sales cycle for which you want to set up stages, and then choose the **Stages** action. The **Sales Cycle Stages** page opens.
2. Choose the **New** action to enter a new stage in the sales cycle.

Repeat these steps to set up as many stages as you want within the sales cycle.

## To assign stage cycles to opportunities

After you add the opportunities stage cycle, you can start to add sales opportunities, and then assign the stage cycle to opportunities by setting the **Sales Cycle Code** field. For more information, see [Create Sales Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md).

## To set up activities with tasks

You can combine multiple tasks, such as tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. You can assign activities to opportunities, salespeople, or contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Activities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define one or more tasks in the activity.

## To assign tasks or activities of tasks to opportunities

When you have set up a task, you can assign it to a sales opportunity and thereby assign the activity that the task belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create tasks of type *Meeting* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. The capability requires access to an on-premises deployment.

The following procedure describes how to assign activity tasks to opportunities. The steps are similar when you assign tasks to salespeople and contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an opportunity, and then choose the **Tasks** action.
3. On the **Task List** page, choose the **Create Task** action.
4. The **Create Task** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > As you can see in the **Opportunity** field, the task is automatically assigned to the relevant opportunity.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. On the **Task List** page, select the new task, and then choose the **Assign Activities** action.

# Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features a **Service Tasks** page that gives an overview of all the service items that need attention. Think of it as your service dashboard where you can see what orders are pending, look for and register spare parts, and keep your inventory up-to-date.  

To track changes and get a graphical view of your service business, use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] statistics tools for quick, automatically generated charting and analysis.  

## To work on a service task  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. Select the service task you want to work on. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action. The **Service Item Worksheet** page opens.  
6. Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
7. In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.  

## To register service operations  
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent. The data you specify is stored on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can update the data when necessary.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to register the service for, and choose the item line.  
3. Choose the **Service Item Worksheet** action  
4. On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  

## To register spare parts  
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to use spare parts for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the spare parts you use on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the relevant spare part.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of items you want to use.  

 You can use a similar procedure to register the spare parts on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the **Service Order** page.  

## To register spare parts from a service order  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order you want to register spare parts for.  
3. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. enter a new service line.  

## To replace a service item or a service item component  
When you service a service item that is composed of components, you may need to replace a faulty component with a new one. Every time that you enter a spare part for a service item with components, you have the option of replacing a component or creating a new one. The new item is not registered as a component of the service item until you post this service line or the service order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the component to replace.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens with three options: **Replace Component**, **New Component**, and **Ignore**. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option | Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Replace Component**|Changes the status of the component you are replacing to not active, and it will appear on the replaced component list for the service item.|  
    |**New Component**|Enters the new component in the component list of the service item.|  
    |**Ignore**|Does nothing to the component list of the service item.|  

7. Choose **Replace Component**.  
8. Choose the component to replace, and then choose **OK**.  

## To change the response time for a service item line  
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, depending on whether the service item is on a service contract the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order or quote to open the card.  
3. On the service item line you want to change the response time for, either in the **Response Time (Hours)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.  

## To register fault/resolution codes  
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault/resolution codes relationships. The fault and resolution codes will appear in the corresponding fields on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can also register the codes directly in this page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Service Item Worksheet** page, choose **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault/Resolution Codes Relationships** page opens.  

  >  [!NOTE]
  >  Filters are set on the relationships that are shown on the page by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

4. Fill out the line. Choose the combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose **OK** to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination on the page.

# Design Details: Inventory Periods
Backdated transactions or cost adjustments often affect balances and stock valuations for accounting periods that may be considered closed. This can have adverse effects on accurate reporting, especially within global corporations. The Inventory Periods feature can be used to avoid such problems by opening or closing inventory periods to limit posting in a set period of time.  

 An inventory period is a period of time, defined by an ending date, in which you post inventory transactions. When you close an inventory period, no value changes can be posted in the closed period. This includes new value postings, expected or invoiced postings, changes to existing values, and cost adjustments. However, you can still apply to an open item ledger entry that falls in the closed period. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 To make sure that all transaction entries in a closed period are final, the following conditions must be met before an inventory period can close:  

-   All outbound item ledger entries in the period must be closed (no negative inventory).  
-   All item costs in the period must be adjusted.  
-   All released and finished production orders in the period must be cost adjusted.  

 When you close an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created by using the number of the last item register that falls in the inventory period. In addition, the time, date, and user code of the user closing the period are recorded in the inventory period entry. By using this information with the last item register for the previous period, you can see which inventory transactions were posted in the inventory period. It is also possible to reopen inventory periods if you need to post in a closed period. When you reopen an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created.

# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. Alternatively, you can set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, along with text that makes the email more friendly, for example, a standard greeting. For more information, see [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. For more information, see [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You cannot also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, then the **Send Email** page opens pre-filled with the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you have set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. For more information, see [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page will not open. See Step 4. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar in nature, or want to send a bulk communication, for example, to advertise a sales campaign, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. You can create a template for an entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts, that will generate the content of an email message for you, and even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, or the document you're sending, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. That's because a default attachment has been assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. For more information, see [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts). 

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add a file that's associated with the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file that's attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they are sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document has been printed. The number in that field <!--"that field?" need a name...--> is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email. <!--guessing this is because emails are technically reports, so the counter bumps up whenever someone creates an email. Need to verify.-->

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. That's to let you resend emails, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can see a list of messages that everyone has sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** is where you'll find the emails that you saved as drafts, and emails that failed to send, for example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Set up intercompany transactions

Intercompany partnerships make it easier to handle accounting processes when two or more subsidiaries of a company frequently do business with each other. Partners can exchange transactions, such as sales and purchases, and handle them either manually or automatically. For example, when a partner sends a sales journal line to another partner, a purchase journal line is created for the receiving partner.

The intercompany chart of accounts can be, for example, a version of the synchronization partner's chart of accounts. Each partner maps their accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Each partner also maps their dimensions and dimension values to the intercompany dimensions.

## Before you start

Before you start to set up your intercompany partnership, there are a few decisions to make.

|Decision  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Which chart of accounts should be the basis for the intercompany chart of accounts?     | All companies in the partnership must use the same intercompany chart of accounts. You can base your intercompany chart of accounts on the chart of accounts from one of the companies in the partnership, or create a new intercompany chart of accounts. You map the accounts to use in the partnership in both ways, so that each partner both sends and receives transactions in the correct accounts. Learn more about setting up the intercompany chart of accounts at [Set up the intercompany charts of accounts](#set-up-the-intercompany-charts-of-accounts).         |
|Which dimensions should be the basis for the intercompany dimensions?     | If you use intercompany dimensions, they must be the same for all companies in the partnership. After you specify your intercompany dimensions, map their dimension values. Learn more about mapping dimension values at [Set up intercompany dimensions](#set-up-intercompany-dimensions).        |
|Which partners are customers or vendors, or both?     |  Learn more about setting up customers and vendor companies in an intercompany partnership at [Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors](#set-up-intercompany-partners-as-customers-and-vendors).       |
|Do you want to specify bank accounts to use in the partnership?| You can speed up the process of registering payment transactions by specifying the bank account to use for each partner company. Learn more at [Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners](#specify-bank-accounts-for-intercompany-partners). |
|How do you want to identify the companies in the partnership?     | All parties must agree on a unique intercompany partner identification code for each company. You assign the code to customer and vendor cards to identify related transactions. Learn more about identifiers at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).        |
|How do you want to handle item numbers?     | If intercompany lines contain items, you can either use your own item numbers, or you can set up your partner's item numbers for each item, either in the **Vendor Item No.** field or in the **Common Item No.** field on the item card. You can also use the **Item Reference** action to map your items' numbers to your intercompany partners descriptions of the items. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).        |
|Are resources involved?     | If intercompany sales transactions include resources, fill in the **IC Partner Purch. G/L Acc. No.** field on the resource card for each resource. The field contains the number of the intercompany general ledger account that the amount for this resource posts to in the partner company. To learn more about resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).<br><br>**NOTE**<br>Intercompany purchase transactions that include resources, fixed assets, and item charges aren't fully supported. In the partner company, the **Line Type** field is blank on purchase document lines that include these entities. You must manually update the field.        |

## Overview of the steps to get started

Use the **Intercompany Setup** page to set up the following components of intercompany transactions:

* Your company's intercompany settings.
* The company that is the synchronization partner.
* The intercompany chart of accounts that all partners use to exchange transactions.
* The mappings between accounts in the chart of accounts and intercompany chart of accounts for inbound and outbound transactions for each partner.
* The intercompany dimensions and dimension values to use, and how they're mapped to dimensions for each partner.
* The companies that are the intercompany partners.
* The companies that are vendors or customers, or both.

## Set up a synchronization partner

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts and, if needed, the same intercompany dimensions. You can save time when you set up the partnership by using the chart of accounts and dimensions for one of the partners as a baseline for the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. The company that you use as the baseline is called the *synchronization partner*. Typically, the synchronization partner is the headquarter company, but it doesn't have to be.

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, each partner specifies the synchronization partner in the **Synchronization Partner** field. Afterward, the intercompany chart of accounts and intercompany dimensions are automatically specified for them, based on the setup for the synchronization partner. The partners then use the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts Mapping** and **Intercompany Dimension Mapping** pages to map their chart of accounts and dimensions to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and vice versa. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to map accounts and dimensions in both directions. That is, both to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and from them to your own accounts and dimensions.

### Connect with partners in another tenant or environment

If one or more partners' [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in another tenant or environment, there are a few extra steps to create the connection. The steps apply to all partners in another tenant or environment.

* Set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a registered app in Azure portal.
* Add and enable the app registration in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Exchange information about their intercompany setups. Each partner can get this information from the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**.

   |Copy from the partner's setup  |Copy to your setup  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Current Connection URL     |IC Partner's Connection URL         |
   |Current Company ID     |IC Partner's Company ID         |
   |Intercompany ID     |IC Partner's Intercompany ID         |
   |Company Name     |IC Partner's Company Name         |

* Exchange the following authentication settings so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can authenticate when it connects. Each partner can get this information from their registered app. To learn more about how to create a registered app, go to [Create a registered app in Azure portal](#create-a-registered-app-in-azure-portal).  

  * Client ID
  * Client secret
  * Token endpoint
  * Redirect URL

Run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details** in all companies to specify the information.

#### Create a registered app in Azure portal

This process is only necessary if you want to connect with a partner whose [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in a different tenant or environment.

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to have a text editor open, such as Notepad, while you create your registered app. You'll need some of the information when you run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**, so it's nice to have the information handy.

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. Choose the **Microsoft Entra ID** service.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **App registrations**.
4. On the **App registrations** page, choose **new registration**.
5. Give the application a name.
6. Choose the **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)** account type.
7. For the redirect URI, in the **Select a platform** field, choose **Web**, and then provide the URI. For example, \**https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm**.

  If you're working with an embed ISV, you might need a different URI.

8. Register the app.
9. On the **Intercompany App** page, on the navigation pane, choose **API permissions**.
10. Choose the **Add a permission** action.
11. On the **Microsoft APIs** tab, choose **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.
12. On the **Request API Permissions** pane, choose **Application permissions**, and then choose the **API.ReadWrite.All** permission.
13. On the **Intercompany App | API permissions** page, choose the **Grant admin consent for Contoso** action, and then grant consent.
14. On the navigation pane, choose **Certificates & secrets**.
15. Choose the **Client secrets** tab, and then choose **New client secret**.
16. On the **Add a client secret** pane, enter a name for the secret, and specify when it expires.

  > [!NOTE]
  > All partners who are in different environments must renew the secret before it expires.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Copy the ID in the **Value** field before you leave the **Intercompany App | Certificates & secrets** page. You'll need it in a later step, and it won't be available after you leave the page. For example, paste the value in a text editor.

17. On the navigation pane, choose **Overview**.
18. Copy the value in the **Application (client) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
19. Choose the **Endpoints** action, and then copy the value in the **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
20. Copy the value in the **Directory (tenant) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
21. In the token value you copied, replace **organizations** with the value you copied from the **Directory (tenant) ID** field in the previous step.

#### Add and enable your registered app in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Entra Application Card**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **State** field, choose **Enabled**. 
4. Choose the **Grant Consent** action. 
5. In the **Permission Set** field, choose **D365 INTERCOMPANY CE & DATA ACCESS IC CE** permission sets.

## Set up the intercompany charts of accounts

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts, and map the accounts in their own chart of accounts to it. If the chart of accounts for your company defines the intercompany chart of accounts for your partner companies, follow the steps in this section.

If you're using an XML file that contains the intercompany chart of accounts, follow the steps in [Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts](intercompany-how-setup.md#import-or-export-an-intercompany-chart-of-accounts).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. To add accounts, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each account on a line on the page.  
    * If your intercompany chart of accounts is identical or similar to your regular chart of accounts, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Chart of Accounts** action. You can edit the new lines as needed.
    * If you set up an intercompany chart of accounts for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those accounts.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany chart of accounts from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany accounts with any changes the partner makes to theirs.

The next step is to map your chart of accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Learn more at [Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts](#map-the-intercompany-chart-of-accounts-to-your-companys-chart-of-accounts).

### Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts

The synchronization company can share its chart of accounts with partners by exporting it to a file. Partners can import the file to get the chart of accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.  

The **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page is filled with new or edited G/L account lines according to the intercompany chart of accounts in the file. Any existing, unrelated lines on the page remain unchanged.

## Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts  

After you define or import the intercompany chart of accounts, map each intercompany account with one of your accounts. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, you specify how intercompany G/L accounts on incoming transactions map to G/L accounts from your company's chart of accounts.

If the intercompany accounts and your accounts have the same numbers, you can map the accounts automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > To access the actions on the page, you might need to expand the page to the wide layout view.

3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Chart of Accounts Mapping** action.
4. You can map the accounts manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Chart of Account** and **G/L Chart of Accounts** panes, choose an account, and then choose an account in the **G/L No.** and **IC No.** fields.
    * To automatically map accounts that have the same numbers, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map to Acc. with Same No** action, and then choose the chart of accounts to update.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all accounts, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

## Set up intercompany dimensions

If partners exchange transactions with dimensions linked to them, agree on the dimensions that all of you use. For example, the synchronization company can create a simplified version of their dimensions, export them to an XML file, and then distribute the file to each partner. Each partner can import the XML file on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page and then map the intercompany dimensions to their dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

> [!NOTE]
> Each company must map their dimensions to the intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents and incoming documents. Mapping accounts in both directions is important, and helps maintain consistency across the companies.

If partners use the synchronization partner's intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in this section. If you want to share using an XML file that contains the intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in [Import or export intercompany dimensions](#import-or-export-intercompany-dimensions).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. To add dimensions, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each dimension on a line.  
    * If your intercompany dimensions are identical or similar to your regular dimensions, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Dimensions** action. Afterward, you can edit the lines as needed.
    * If you specify intercompany dimensions for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those dimensions.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany dimensions from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany dimensions with any changes the partner makes to theirs.  

### Import or export intercompany dimensions  

The synchronization company can share its dimensions with partners by exporting them to a file. Partners can import the file to get the dimensions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.  
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.

The next step is to map the dimensions with the intercompany dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

### Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions

After you specify the dimensions you use, map each intercompany dimension with one of your company's dimensions, and vice versa. Use the **Intercompany Dimensions Mapping** page to specify the mapping. Afterward, repeat the process for the dimension values.

* Specify how intercompany dimensions on incoming transactions map to dimensions from your company's list of dimensions.
* Specify how your dimensions translate to intercompany dimensions on *outgoing transactions*.

If any of the intercompany dimensions have the same code as the corresponding dimensions in your company, you can automatically map the dimensions.  

In the following steps, you first map intercompany dimensions to dimensions for incoming documents in the **Intercompany Dimensions** pane. Then, you map dimensions to intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents on the **Current Company Dimensions** pane.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Dimensions Mapping** action.
4. You can map the dimensions manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Dimensions** and **Current Company Dimensions** panes, choose a dimension, and then choose a dimension in the **Dim. Code** and **IC Dim. Code** fields.
    * To automatically map dimensions that have the same code, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map dimensions with same code** action, and then choose the dimensions to update. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all dimensions, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

5. Choose the **Dimension Values Mapping** action.
6. On the **Intercompany Dimension Values Mapping** page, the steps to create the mapping are similar to what you just did for dimensions.

## Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches

You must set up a general journal template and a general journal batch to use by default for intercompany transactions. The template and batch are especially important if you automatically accept intercompany transactions from your partners. To learn more about autoaccepting transactions, go to [Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners](#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).

* General journals are used to post to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, and vendor accounts. Posting with a general journal always creates entries on general ledger accounts. Use the **Intercompany General Journal** page to set up the general journal batch to use. The settings that are specific to intercompany transactions are the accounts you specify in the **IC Account Type** and **IC Account No** fields.
* Journal templates give you a journal page designed for a specific purpose. That is, the fields in journal templates are exactly the ones needed for a particular part of the program. Use the **General Journal Templates** page to set up a template to use for intercompany transactions.

To learn more about general journal templates and batches, go to [Use journal templates and batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Set up a company for intercompany transactions

The following steps assume that a synchronization partner is set up with the chart of accounts and dimensions on which you base the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. You can set them up yourself, but it's typically faster to get started, and maintenance is easier, to you use a synchronization partner. To learn more about the synchronization partner, go to [Set up a synchronization partner](#set-up-a-synchronization-partner).

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab on the **Intercompany Setup** page for each partner before you add their partners. When you add partner companies that are in the same tenant, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets their IC code and company name from their setup on the General FastTab. The **Company Name** field will verify that their IC code is unique.

> [!NOTE]
> If you'll use a synchronization partner, leave the **Synchronization Partner** field blank when you set that company up for the partnership.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Setup** page, fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't use file locations to transfer transactions to your partners because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't access your local network. Therefore, if you choose **File Location** in the **Transfer Type** field, the **Folder Path** field is not available. Instead, the file will be downloaded to the **Downloads** folder on your computer. You then send the file to someone in the partner company, for example, by email. For a more direct process, we recommend that you choose **Email**.

The next step is to set up the partner companies.

## Set up intercompany partners

Each partner must add all other companies in the partnership as a partner.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, choose **Add**.
3. In the **Transfer Type** field, specify how you send data to the partner.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **File Location** option works only for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

4. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all companies in the partnership.

> [!NOTE]
> For intercompany posting, if you turn on the **Auto. Accept Transaction** toggle on the **Intercompany Partner** page [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suppresses messages that warn about purchase invoices duplicating the original purchase order. It's important to have a business process for managing duplicates. For example, by deleting such purchase orders when the purchase invoice is received from the intercompany partner.

### Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, open the card page for the partner.
3. Depending on what you want to do, choose the customer or partner in the **Customer No.** or **Vendor No.** fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the customer or vendor hasn't been created, you can choose **+New** in the drop-down menu to set them up. To learn more about creating customers and vendors, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md) and [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also specify a customer or vendor as an intercompany partner by filling in the **IC Partner Code** field on the **Customer Card** and **Vendor Card** pages.

### Set up default intercompany partner general ledger accounts  

On the **G/L Account Card** page, for accounts that you regularly use on outgoing intercompany sales or purchase lines, you can specify a default intercompany partner general ledger account. For example, for your receivables accounts, you can enter the corresponding payables accounts from the intercompany chart of accounts. The receivables and payables accounts are used as the off-setting account for the intercompany partner when you post transactions on intercompany general journals.  

Then, when you enter a general ledger account in the **Bal. Account No.** field on an intercompany line with **Intercompany Partner** in the **Account Type** field, the **IC Partner G/L Account** field is automatically filled in.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the G/L account that's used for intercompany transactions, and in the **Default IC Partner G/L Account** field, enter the intercompany general ledger account that your partner post to when you post to the general ledger account on the line.
3. Repeat step 2 for each account that you often enter in the **Bal. Account No.** field on a line in an intercompany journal or document.

### Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners

To make it faster to process intercompany transactions, you can specify that you want to automatically create journal lines based on an intercompany partner's posts from the **IC General Journal** page. To autocreate incoming and outgoing transactions, you must turn on the following toggles for each partner:

* On the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle for the synchronization partner. Then specify where to create received intercompany journal transactions by filling in the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** and **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Batch** fields.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** field is blank, you need to set up a general journal template to use for your intercompany general journals. To learn more about templates and batches, go to [Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches](#set-up-intercompany-general-journal-templates-and-batches)    

* On the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto Accept Transactions** toggle.

The journal lines are created for you, but not posted.

### Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners

To facilitate fast payments, specify one or more bank accounts to use for intercompany partners. When a partner uses an intercompany general journal to make a payment, they can specify the bank account on the line. The bank account is used as the balancing account in the receiving company, which minimizes the need to manually enter transactions.

* To specify the bank account to use, on the **Intercompany Partners** page, choose the **Bank Accounts** action. On the **Intercompany Bank Account Card**, enter the account information.

## Troubleshoot your intercompany setup

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, the **Intercompany Setup Diagnostics** pane contains tiles that indicate whether all of the components needed to exchange intercompany transactions are set up. The tiles are also available on the Business Manager Role Center. Choose the tiles to find out what's missing. For an overview of the required components, go to [Overview of the steps to get started](#overview-of-the-steps-to-get-started).

# Displaying Lists in Different Ways
In the right corner of any list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you will find icons that let you choose how the list of records is displayed. A list can be displayed as detailed rows, which is ideal when you need to work with many fields or edit fields in the list. But you can also switch to display records as tiles, which is more compact and shows less fields on the specific record. This is very useful to gain an overview of several entries and is in particular useful on smaller devices, because it is compact and easier to tap.

## Item List
On the **Items** page, having pictures helps you get a quick overview of what you sell and switching to the tiles gives you an item catalogue to browse through. For lists that include pictures, such as the **Items** page, you have a third option to display as large tiles. This displays large pictures for each record but also shows few fields.

You can import item pictures, either one by one or for multiple items in one go. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

# Managing Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides an overview of what you can do as an administrator to control Microsoft Teams integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## In Microsoft Teams

### Minimum requirements

This section describes the minimum requirements for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app features to work in Teams.

- Required licenses

    The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app requires a Teams license through a Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise plan, Microsoft Teams EEA, or a similar plan that includes Microsoft Teams. Standalone Teams plans like Microsoft Teams (free) or Microsoft Teams Essentials aren't supported.

    Most features of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams also require a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license, as shown in the following table.

    |What|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license|
    |----|---|
    |Search for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record into a conversation, and send it as a card.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Share a link from a page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Teams conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |View a card of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.||
    |View more details of card for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Open a page link in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|

- Allow URL previews

    **Allow URL previews** policy setting must be turned on. Otherwise, a card can't be generated for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links pasted into a Teams conversation. Learn more about this setting in [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

### Managing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app (optional)

As a Teams administrator, you can manage all apps for your organization, including the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. You can approve or install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for your organization, block user's from installing the app, and more.

Learn more in the Microsoft Teams documentation at:

- [Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps)
- [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies)

## In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

### Minimum requirements

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version:

  Teams integration is only supported for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, not on-premises.

- Codeunit **2718 Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service:

  This codeunit is published as a web service by default. The codeunit is part of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] system application. It's used to get the field data for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page added to a Teams conversation. Learn more about publishing web services in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

- <a name="permissions"></a>User permissions:

  For the most part, the contact search, pages, and data that users can view and edit in a Teams conversation is controlled by their permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

  - To search for contacts, users must have at least read permission to the **Contacts** table. 
  - To paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link into a Teams conversation and have it expand into a card, users must have at least read permission on the page and its data.
  - Once a card is submitted into a conversation, any user in that conversation can view that card without permission to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  - To view more details for a card or open the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must have read permission on the page and its data.
  - To change data, user's need modify permissions.

  Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment

The Microsoft Teams admin center is where you configure Teams app setup policies for the organization. In the Teams admin center, you can use the Centralized Deployment feature to automatically install the Business Central app in Teams for all users in your organization, specific groups, or individual users.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up Centralized Deployment, your Teams account must have at least the [Teams Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#teams-administrator) role.

1. In Business Central, choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Teams App Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link. Or select [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1833) to open the page directly.
2. Read the information on the **Set up the Business Central app for Teams**, then choose **Next** when ready.
3. Open the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163970), and complete the following steps.
    1. Go to **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.
    2. Create a new policy or select the policy that you want to use to install the Business Central app, then select **Add apps**.
    3. In the **Add installed apps** page, search for and select **Business Central**.
    4. Choose **Add**.

       Business Central should now appear under **Installed apps** for the policy.
    5. Configure more settings as needed, then choose **Save**.

    Learn more in [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies) in the Teams documentation.
4. Go back to **Teams App Centralized Deployment** in Business Central and select **Done**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the app setup policy to be applied and the app deployed to users.

## Managing privacy and compliance

Microsoft Teams provides extensive controls for compliance and management of sensitive or personally identifiable data&mdash;including data added to chats and channels by the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

### Understanding where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] cards are stored

After a card is sent to a chat, the card and the fields shown on the card are copied to Teams. This information is subject to the Teams policies for your organization, such as data retention policies. When displaying card details, none of the data in the details window is stored in Teams. The data remains stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and will only be retrieved by Teams when the user chooses to view the details. 

- Learn more about where Teams stores that data at [Location of data in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams).
- Learn more about retention policies in Teams at [Retention policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/retention-policies).

### Restricting sharing of cards 

You prevent specific users or groups from sending cards to chats or channels by setting up messaging policies that turn off the **URL Previews** setting. For more information about this setting, see [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams). 

You can also use information barriers to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other. To learn more, see [Information barriers in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/information-barriers-in-teams).

Data loss prevention features in the Microsoft Purview can't be applied specifically to cards. But they can be applied to the chat messages that contain the cards.

### Responding to data requests

You allow team members and team owners to delete messages that contain sensitive cards by setting up messaging policies, like: **Owners can delete sent messages** and **Users can delete sent messages**. Learn more at [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

Content search and eDiscovery compliance features in the Microsoft Purview can also be applied to cards.

Because card data in Teams is a copy of data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can also use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features to export a customer’s data if requested. Learn more  about privacy in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Privacy FAQ for Business Central Customers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/privacyfaq).

## Show or hide record data on cards

When a record is shared with others in a Teams chat or channel, a card with fields that contain data about the record is shown. All recipients can view this data (or record summary) by default, regardless of their license or permissions in Business Central. If you're an admin, you can use the **Card Settings** assisted setup guide to hide the record summary from appearing on cards in Teams. Hiding the record summary removes all fields and images but continues to show the **Details** button and other non-record information on the card.

|Record summary on|Record summary off|
|-|-|
|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned on.](media/card-settings-example-on.png)|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned off.](media/card-settings-example-off.png)|

You configure the setting per environment. So when you turn the record summary on or off, it affects all companies in the environment.

1. In Business Central, open the environment that you want to change.

   > [!TIP]
   > To switch the environment, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.
2. Choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Card Settings**, and then choose the related link.
3. Read the information on the **Card Settings**, then choose **Next** when ready.
4. On the **Data Visibility** page, turn on the **Show record summary** switch to display data on the cards or off to hide the data.
5. Select **Next** and follow the instructions to complete the setup guide.

# Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory Valuation app pulls data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to provide business leaders key information about inventory across their organization. The app has various reports that offer insights into costing areas. The report can help you make informed decisions and ensure you account for costs.

## Inventory valuation analytics for leadership teams

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock costs

Chief executives want to identify locations that hold the most stock value. The [Inventory Valuation by Location](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-location.md) report can help you find that location. You can also break down this data by using the [Inventory Valuation by Item](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-item.md) report to explore the value of each item you have on hand.

## How to use the reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

The following table describes on how you can use each report in the app.

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# About Finished Production Order Costs

Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the item that is being produced. Final costs, including variances in a standard cost environment, actuals in a FIFO, Average, or LIFO cost environment, are calculated using the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which allows for financial reconciliation of the costs of item production. For a production order to be considered for cost adjustment, the status must be **Finished**. It is therefore critical that upon completion, the status of a production order is changed to **Finished**.  

## Example

In a standard cost environment, when you consume material to produce an item, stated simply, the cost of the item plus labor and overhead go into WIP. When the item is produced, WIP is reduced by the amount of the standard cost of the item. Typically, these costs do not net to zero. So that these costs can net to zero, you must run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, noting that only production orders with the status of **Finished** will be considered for adjustment.

# General Ledger Entries (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **General Ledger Entries** report provides a detailed view of individual entries from the general ledger, so you can quickly filter and locate specific entries. This report is a valuable tool for tracking financial transactions, reconciliation, and facilitating efficient audits by giving easy access to detailed entry information.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the General Ledger Entries report" lightbox="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Finance managers
- Finance staff

Finance managers use the report to reconcile transactions for a specific fiscal period. By filtering the report to display only entries from that period, you can systematically review all recorded transactions. This process helps you find discrepancies, such as missing entries or erroneous amounts, and ensure that the general ledger accurately reflects the company's activities. Once reconciled, you can confidently prepare financial statements and provide insights into the organization's financial health for that period.

<!-- ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *General Ledger Entries* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Amount**](####) -->

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

# Publish a web service

Web services are a lightweight way to make application functionality available to different kinds of external systems and users. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] exposes several objects as web services for better integration with other Microsoft services. You can add other web services as your business requires.  

Set up a web service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then publish the web service so that it's available to authenticated users. All authorized users can access metadata for web services, but only users who have sufficient permissions can access actual data.  

## Creating and Publishing a Web Service

The following steps explain how to create and publish a web service.  

### To create and publish a web service  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Web Services** page, choose **New**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > **Codeunit** and **Page** are valid types for SOAP web services. **Page** and **Query** are valid types for OData web services. Starting with version 16.3, **Codeunit** is also a valid type for OData v4 web services, but then no URL is shown in the user interface. 
    > Also, if the database contains multiple companies, you can choose an object ID that is specific to one of the companies.  
    > Finally, the service name is visible to consumers of your web service and is the basis for identifying and distinguishing web services, so you should make the name meaningful.

3. Select the check box in the **Published** column.  

When you publish the web service, the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields show the new URLs. However, for codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, the URL fields aren't shown.  

You can test the web service immediately by choosing the links in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields. Optionally, copy the value of the field and save it for later use. To test codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, follow the instructions in the [Verifying web service availability](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action#verifying-web-service-availability) section in the developer content.

> [!NOTE]
> If the objects that you expose as web services must not be accessible from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must mark the methods exposed in the code as `[Scope('OnPrem')]`. For more information, see [Scope Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods/devenv-scope-attribute).

After you publish a web service, it's available to external parties. You can verify the availability of that web service by using a browser, or choose the link in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields on the **Web Services** page. The following procedure illustrates how you can verify the availability of the web service for later use.  

### To verify the availability of a web service  

1. In your browser, enter the relevant URL. The following table illustrates the types of URLs that you can enter for different web service types.  

    > [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
    > |Type|Syntax|Example|
    > |----------------|------|-------|
    > |SOAP|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/WS/*CompanyName*/*entity*/` |`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/WS/CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc./Page/InvoiceDocument`|
    > |OData V4|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/ODataV4/Company('*CompanyName*')/*entity*`|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.')/InvoiceDocument`<br/>    The company name is case-sensitive.|

2. Review the information that is displayed in the browser. Verify that you can see the name of the web service that you created.  

When you access a web service, and you want to write data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the company name. You can specify the company as part of the URI as shown in the examples; alternatively, specify the company as part of the query parameters. For example, the following URIs point to the same OData web service and are both valid URIs.  

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/Customer  
```

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Customer?company='CRONUS International Ltd.'  
```

# Edit Posted Documents

Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents across all supported markets:

- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in the specified countries or regions:

- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment

The following explains how to edit a posted sales shipment. The steps are similar for the other supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the document that you want to edit, and then choose the **Update Document** action. Alternatively, open the document and then choose the action.
3. On the **Posted Sales Shipment - Update** page, edit the **Package Tracking No.** field, for example.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The posted sales shipment is updated.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item card, and variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> Although you can assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares aren't available on SKUs. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)

# Viewing Database Locks

Database locking controls access by multiple users to the same data at the same time. To protect a transaction against other transactions modifying the same data, the first transaction puts a lock on the data. The lock remains until the transaction's done.

Users may be blocked from completing transactions on the locked data. They'll typically get a message that indicates the lock condition.

## To view database locks

Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Database Locks**, and then choose the related link.

The **Database Locks** page gives snapshot of all current database locks.

For more information about database locking, see [Monitoring Database Locks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-database-locks) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

To help you get started with financial reporting, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the company’s chart of accounts for basic financial reporting.

## Custom financial reporting

If you're already familiar with financial reporting and you want more complex reports, you can create your own.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last 12 months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags you can attach to postings to the general ledger to provide more business insights to financial reporting. Adding dimensions enriches the reports and expands them into operational reporting.

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers in financial reporting that aren't calculated by a formula can take you to the original transactions. You can make active analyses from the financial report to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you format financial reporting so that it looks the same every month, without manual work. Export to Excel makes it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values update each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting doesn't require that you know how to code. Finance professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.

# Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation

You can use various methods of depreciation for preparing financial statements and income tax returns. Many large corporations use straight-line depreciation in their financial statements because this generally permits reporting higher earnings. For income tax purposes, however, many businesses use an accelerated depreciation method, such as declining-balance depreciation. You define an asset's depreciation method with the **Depreciation Method** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page. For more information about what the different methods do, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).

You set up depreciation books where you define the different ways depreciation must be calculated for different types of fixed assets. Each depreciation book specifies individual depreciation terms. For example, you can specify that a fixed asset should be depreciated over a period of three years in one book and over a period of five years in another book.

When you have created the relevant depreciation books, you must assign one or more depreciation books to each fixed asset. A depreciation book that is assigned to a fixed asset is referred to as a fixed asset depreciation book. You can set up an unlimited number of depreciation books for a fixed asset.  

## To create a depreciation book

In a fixed asset depreciation book, you specify how fixed assets are depreciated. To accommodate various methods of depreciation, you can set up multiple depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Depreciation Books List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Follow the next step to define which type of journal is used for the different fixed asset activities by default.
4. On the **Integration** FastTab, select the check box for each fixed asset activity whose transactions you want to post using the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each depreciation method or posting method that you want to assign to fixed assets as a depreciation book.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Choose the **Use Rounding in Periodic Depr.** field to round the calculated periodic depreciation amounts to whole numbers. For example, if your company also uses invoice rounding to whole numbers in the **General Ledger Setup** page, rounding also depreciation amounts to whole numbers can help provide transparency.

For example, if you dispose of a fixed asset where the depreciation book does not specify rounding, but your company's general ledger setup requires rounding, then, when you dispose of the fixed asset, you will see an error message that an amount must be rounded on a ledger entry.  

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Depreciation Books** action to specify one or more fixed asset depreciation books.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   When you use the manual depreciation method, you must enter depreciation manually in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** function omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method. You can use this method for assets that are not subject to depreciation, such as land.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use the user-defined depreciation method, you need to assign the depreciation book in a different way. For more information, see [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

## To assign a depreciation book to multiple fixed assets with a batch job

If you want to assign a depreciation book to several fixed assets, you can use the **Create FA Depreciation Books** batch job to create fixed asset depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a assign a depreciation book to, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, choose the **Create FA Depreciation Books** action.
4. On the **Create FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Depreciation Book** field.
5. Choose the **Copy from FA No.** field, and then select the fixed asset number that you want to use as the basis for creating new fixed asset depreciation books.

    If you fill in this field, the depreciation fields in the new fixed asset depreciation books will contain the same information as the corresponding fields in the fixed asset depreciation book that you copy from. Leave the field blank if you want to create new fixed asset depreciation books with empty depreciation fields.  
6. On the **Fixed Asset** FastTab, you can set a filter to select the assets that you want to create the fixed asset depreciation books for.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

## To set up depreciation posting types

For each depreciation book, you must set up how you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle various posting types. For example, whether posting should be debit or credit and whether the posting type should be included in the depreciable basis.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to set up, and them choose the **FA Posting Type Setup** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Type Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You cannot insert or delete lines on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. You can only modify the existing lines.

We recommend that you do not change the setup for depreciation books for entries that have already been posted. Changes will not affect the entries that are already posted, which would make depreciation book statistics misleading.

## To set up default templates and batches for fixed asset depreciation

For each depreciation book, you define a default setup of templates and batches. You use these defaults to duplicate lines from one journal to another, create journal lines using the **Calculate Depreciation** or **Index Fixed Assets** batch jobs, duplicate acquisition costs in the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to define default journals for, and then choose the **FA Journal Setup** action.  
3. If you want to have a default setup for each user, choose the **User ID** field to select from the **Users** page.  
4. In the other fields, select the journal template or journal batch that must be used by default.  

## Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation

When the Calculate Depreciation batch job calculates depreciations, the batch job normally uses a standardized year of 360 days where each of the 12 months has 30 days.

If you select this field, the Calculate Depreciation batch job uses the calendar year of 365 days instead, where each month is calculated with the same number of days as in the calendar. The only exception is February in leap years, which the batch job will treat as having 28 days and not 29. Because of that, all years, also leap years, are considered to have 365 days.

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

# Insure fixed assets

Use the **Insurance Card** page to set up an insurance policy to cover one or more fixed assets. You can assign one fixed asset to one insurance policy, or multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy.

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger from the **Insurance Journal** page.

In addition, you can assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy and create coverage ledger entries when you post its acquisition cost. You post an acquisition cost from the fixed asset journal with the **Insurance No.** field filled in. You must turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. For more information, see [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](fa-how-acquire.md#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page isn't turned on, posting acquisitions from the fixed asset journal creates lines on the **Insurance Journal** page. You must post those lines manually.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you don't turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, your insurance journal should be based on a journal template without a number series. This is because the inserted document numbers from the fixed asset journal line will otherwise conflict with the number series of the insurance journal. For more information about journal templates and batches, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).

After you assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, the **Insured** field on the fixed asset card contains **Yes**. When you sell the fixed asset, the toggle is automatically turned off.

## To create or modify an insurance card

When you receive information about changes in the coverage amount, you must enter the new information on the **Insurance Card** page to ensure that you analyze insurance policy coverage correctly.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card for an insurance policy. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Alternatively, select the insurance policy that you want to change, and then choose the **Edit** action.

## To assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting from the insurance journal

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger.  

The following procedure explains how to create an insurance journal line manually. If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle is turned on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, insurance journal lines are automatically created when you post acquisition costs. In that case, all you have to do is to post the journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant journal, and fill in the journal lines as necessary.  
3. To assign multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy, create journal lines with the same value in the **Insurance No.** field and different values in the **FA No.** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The entries from an insurance journal are only posted to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To update the insurance value of a fixed asset

You can use the **Index Insurance** batch job to update the value of the fixed assets that are covered.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   In the **Index Figure** field, you enter a decrease of 5%, for example, as 95, whereas you enter an increase of 2% as 102.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

   The batch job calculates the new amount as a percentage of the total value insured, as stated on the **Insurance Statistics** page, and then creates a line in the insurance journal.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Open the relevant insurance journal, review the created values, and then post them to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To monitor insurance coverage

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing insurance policies and whether your fixed assets are over- or under-insured.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed assets insurance, go to [Fixed assets insurance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-insurance-reports).

### Overview of insurance policies

To get an overview of your insurance policies, use the [Insurance - List](reports/report-5621.md) report.

### Insurance coverage

To find out which insurance policies cover each asset, and by which amount, use the [Insurance - Tot. Value Insured](reports/report-5625.md) report.

#### Over/under coverage

You can check whether fixed assets are over- or under-insured in the following ways:  

* The **Insurance Statistics** page. A positive amount in the **Over/Under Insured** field means that the fixed asset is over-insured. A negative amount means that the asset is under-insured.  
* The **Fixed Asset Statistics** page. Choose the **Total Value Insured** field to view the **Ins. Coverage Ledger Entries** page.  
* The **Over/Under Coverage** report.  
* The [Insurance - Analysis](reports/report-5620.md) report.  


### Uninsured fixed assets

To check whether you forgot to assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, use the [Insurance - Uninsured FAs](reports/report-5626.md) report. 


## To view insurance coverage ledger entries

You can view the entries that you made in the insurance coverage ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Coverage Ledger Entries** action.  


## To view the total insurance value of fixed assets

A matrix page shows the insurance values that are registered for each insurance policy for each fixed asset that result from posted insurance-related amounts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Total Value Insures per FA** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.  
5. To see the underlying insurance coverage ledger entries, choose a value in the matrix.  

## To correct insurance coverage entries

If a fixed asset was assigned to the wrong insurance policy, you can correct it by creating two reclassification entries from the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create one journal line for the fixed asset and the correct insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is positive.  
3. Create another journal line for the fixed asset and the incorrect insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is negative.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The fixed asset is removed from the incorrect insurance policy on the second line. The asset is assigned to the correct insurance policy on the first line of the journal.

# Setup Best Practices: Costing Method

The **Costing Method** on the item card defines item's cost flow is recorded and whether an actual or budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation.  

Setting the correct costing method according to item type and business environment is important to ensure economical inventories.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up the **Costing Method** field. For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|FIFO|Use where the product cost is stable.<br /><br /> Use for items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date.|An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> In inventory valuation, it is assumed that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. **Note:**  When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.|  
|LIFO|Use where levels of inventories are consistently maintained or increased over time.|An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> In inventory valuation, it is assumed that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. **Note:**  When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates. **Important:**  Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.|  
|Average|Use where the product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> Use where inventories are piled or mixed together and cannot be differentiated, such as chemicals.|An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> For inventory valuation, it is assumed that all inventories are sold simultaneously.|
|Specific|Use in production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> Use for items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> Use for items with serial numbers.|An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received.|
|Standard|Use where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> Use in repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Use where there is discipline and staff to maintain standards.|An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values.|

# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

In the **Help and Support** page, you can see the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that your company is based on. If you want to base a company on a different version, your administrator can create a new production environment. For more information, see [Create a new production environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-production-environment) in the developer- and IT Pro content.  

## Languages of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help

The Help content for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] publishes to Microsoft Learn. The content is available in different languages. If you access the documentation while you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the content displays in your language. By default, if a particular page isn't available in your language yet, it shows in English.

### How do I change the language of the Microsoft Learn site?

Scroll to the bottom of the browser page and choose the globe symbol in the bottom left corner.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list shows all languages that are supported by the Microsoft Learn site. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in a limited number of countries/regions, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help content is not available in all languages that the Microsoft Learn site supports.

# Set Up Salespeople

Many companies want to follow an individual employee's performance as a basis for calculating the sales commission or bonus. See, for example, the **Salesperson Commissions** report. A company may also want to assign a salesperson to each of their contacts.

When you have set up a salesperson on the **Salespeople** page, you can select it in the **Salesperson Code** field on all relevant records, such as G/L account, customer, vendor, contacts, and campaign cards. Then, when you post or set up invoices, credit memos, journal lines, finance charge activities, and so on, the salesperson code is carried to the resulting ledger entries.

# Printer setup and management overview

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Printing documents and reports from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an important task for business users. You typically want to send print jobs directly to one of your organization's printers&mdash;no matter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client or app you're using. Because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is a cloud service, it can't directly reach local printers connected to users' devices, but you can connect it to cloud-enabled printers.

## What are your printer possibilities in Business Central

To support your print needs, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the following features:

|Feature|Description|Web client| Mobile app|App for Teams|
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
|Universal Print|Universal Print is a printer management solution available as a cloud service from Microsoft. With this feature, you can set up your printers in Universal Print, then register them for use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature requires a Universal Print subscription and the **Universal Print Integration** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Email Print|This feature lets you set up email-enabled printers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then sends print jobs to a printer using the printer's email address. This feature requires email-enabled printers, and the **Send to Email Printer** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Browser printing|The print features of your browser handle the print jobs. If a cloud printer isn't installed and set up, or if an installed printer fails, then printing defaults to the printing options for the browser. The **Printer** field on the report request page displays *(Handled by the browser)*.|![works online](media/check.png)|||

Most of the work for setting up printers can be done from the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although with Universal Print printers, you might also have to work in Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Business Central on-premises, Universal Print and Email Print require that Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is used.

## Custom printer extensions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports other custom printer extensions that add even more print features. So if you have any custom printer extensions installed, your application might include print features not described in this article.

If you're an AL developer and want to learn about how to create printer extensions, go to [Developing Printer Extensions in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reports-printing).

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# Set up bank accounts

Use bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in your local currency or a foreign currency. After you set up bank accounts, you can also print checks. Bank accounts also offer features for [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md), [bank reconciliation](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md), and the import and export of bank files.

You can include bank accounts in transactions in general journal. Each bank account links to an account in the chart of accounts through the assigned bank account posting group. Using a bank account in a payment transaction automatically creates an entry in both the bank account and the connected general ledger (G/L) account.  

Bank accounts work differently depending on whether a currency code is specified:

- If a currency code isn't specified, all transactions in the bank account are in the local currency (LCY) for the current company. If you make a transaction for the account in another currency, the amounts post to the account in LCY based on the currency exchange rate. Any checks issued from this account must be in LCY. If the bank account is used in a journal, the journal line automatically uses the blank currency code.  
  
- If a currency code is specified, all transactions made to this account, and all checks issued from it, must use the same currency as the account.

You can save time on data entry by making a bank account the default account to use for the currency specified for the account. If you do, the account is assigned to sales and service documents that use the currency. To make the account the default for sales and service documents, on the **Bank Account Card** page, turn on the **Use as Default for Currency** toggle. If needed, you can choose a different account when you're working on a document.

A bank account is an integral part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and plays a role in many other capabilities. The following illustration shows the most important relations:

![Illustration of bank account relations.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank_Account_Relations.png)

Creating a bank account makes it available in all the places shown in the illustration, and are mirrored in the G/L account and on the **Company Information** page.

Bank accounts are often monitored daily to ensure new payments from customers are registered as quickly as possible. Registering payments quickly helps ensure a customer's actual status is reflected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Keeping the status of customer payments current helps sales people, accountants, and other employees making unnecessary calls regarding overdue invoices or delays in shipments.  

![Illustration of bank payment.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank-payment-flow.png)

Another task is to import vendor currency payments with the realized currency rates to make sure that the actual status of the vendors is up-to-date. Using the [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) capability is the easiest way to do that. In the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, you can import bank transactions directly from an online bank application and post them more or less automatically. The journal automatically identifies and posts the following transactions:  

- Direct debit payments from customers.  
- Customer payments of single invoices.  
- Lump-sum payments from customers.  
- Customer payments in foreign currencies.  
- Vendor payments.  
- Vendor payments in foreign currency.  
- Vendor payments and subscriptions that are recurring.  
- Bank charges and interests.  

Payment reconciliation provides significant time savings in posting incoming and outgoing payments. However, the transactions on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't considered 100% correct until you run a bank reconciliation.  

Bank reconciliation is how you make sure that the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the external account at the bank.  

 ![Illustration of bank account reconciliation.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/BankReconciliation.png)

In the illustration, the left side represents the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the rightmost side represents transactions imported from the bank through the online bank application. The diagram in the middle shows the transactions from both sides that make up the bank reconciliation.

From the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], most transactions should be known to the physical bank. The few exceptions include the following cases:  

- Corrections posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
- Checks issued that aren't cashed.
- Vendor payments not yet approved by the bank.  

From the physical account at the bank, transactions not identified in the payment reconciliation journal arrive all the time, such as the following transactions:  

- New vendor subscriptions  
- Customer payments without description
- Bank interest
- Bank charges
- Credit card charges not yet reported

The better you are at mapping information in the payment reconciliation journal, the more transactions are posted automatically and the easier periodic bank reconciliation becomes.

The following video shows the basic steps to set up a bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> Some fields may contain sensitive data, such as the **Bank Branch No.**, **Bank Account No.**, **SWIFT Code**, and **IBAN Code** fields. Learn more at [Monitor Sensitive Fields](across-log-changes.md#monitor-sensitive-fields).

## To set up bank accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Bank Accounts** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    An example would be the **Bank Acc. Posting Group** field that connects the bank account to the underlying G/L account in the balance sheet. Learn more at [Set Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).

> [!TIP]
> Some fields are hidden until you choose the **Show more** action, typically because they are rarely used. Others must be added through personalization. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

You can create as many bank accounts as you need for your business. For each bank account, you must specify information that makes the bank account uniquely identifiable. This information includes the bank's geographical address; number series for different types of transactions, such as direct debit and credit transfers; the currency amounts are specified in; and information used for importing bank statements. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To enter an opening balance

To fill in the **Balance** field with an opening balance, you must post a bank account ledger entry with the amount in question. You post the entry through a bank account reconciliation. Learn more at [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  
>
> Alternatively, you can implement the opening balance as part of general data creation in new companies using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup guide. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that were posted directly to it typically prevent you from reconciling the bank account. With foreign currency bank accounts, direct posting results in differences that accumulate as you post more bank reconciliations. Usually, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, later you can reverse it out of the G/L account you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In either case, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation&mdash;especially if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

## To set up your bank account for import or export of bank files

The fields related to the import and export of bank feeds and files are on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Bank Account Card** page. Learn more at [Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account to export or import bank files for.
3. On the **Transfer** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** page. You'll be informed of wrong or missing setup values when you export the file. Read the short descriptions of the fields carefully or refer to the related procedure topics. For example, exporting a payment file for North American electronic funds transfer (EFT) requires that both the **Last Remittance Advice No.** and the **Transit No.** fields be filled in. Learn more at [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

The fields on the **Transit** FastTab on the bank account serve different purposes, depending on whether the payment is inbound or outbound.

The following illustration shows the route of inbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

1. The transactions are exported from the bank account in either a human-readable .csv format or the bank's own format.
2. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
3. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
4. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
5. The payments are imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

Incoming payments are always imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or directly into the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. In contrast, outgoing payments can originate from any payment journal. The only prerequisite is that the **Allow Payment Export** field in the relevant payment journal batch must be selected.

The following illustration shows the route of outbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

## To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files

Fields on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Vendor Bank Account Card** page are related to the export of bank feeds and files. Learn more at [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

[!INCLUDE[purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

## Changing your bank account

To use a different bank account for your business, you must create the new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We recommend that you don't just replace the information about the account you're currently using because that can cause incorrect data. For example, your opening balance might be incorrect or your bank feed might stop working correctly. It's important that you keep the current and new accounts separate.

After you create the new bank account, you should also create a new bank posting group and assign it to a new general ledger account. You can reuse an existing bank posting group, and bank transactions are posted to the same general ledger accounts as other bank accounts sharing that bank posting group. However, we recommend that you create a new bank posting group and general ledger account so that reconciliations are easier to do.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the bank account information on open sales invoices still shows the original bank account. Accordingly, payments are likely to still be posted to that account. We recommend that you keep both accounts active for a period of time after the change.

To get a more condensed view of your cash accounts in financial reporting, use the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts in your chart of accounts, the **Totaling** rows in financial reports, or G/L account categories. Learn more at [Business Intelligence and Financial Reporting](bi.md) section.

# Expected Capacity Need (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Expected Capacity Need** report provides insights into the capacity you expect to require for each work center. It helps manufacturing managers plan production orders and allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Expected Capacity Need Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to view the expected capacity needs of each work center. The data can help you allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands. This report shows the backlog of production orders and the work center availability to meet the demands. You can further break down production orders to see which orders are scheduled for each work center group and take actions to handle the expected capacity need.

Production supervisors use this report to understand the workload on your work center group, and take action to handle the expected capacity need. The report provides insights into the expected capacity need, capacity used, and capacity used variance. These insights help you optimize the use of resources.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Expected Capacity Need* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Capacity Need (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-need-hours)
- [Capacity Used (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-hours)
- [Capacity Used Variance (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-variance-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order
- Production Order Routing Line
- Capacity Ledger Entry

# Walkthrough: Planning Supplies Manually

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand. You can initiate supply planning at fixed intervals, for example, every morning or every Monday, or when you are notified by sales or production, depending on the type of demand. In this walkthrough you will use the **Order Planning** page, a simple supply planning tool that is based on manual decision-making instead of parameter-based automatic planning.  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Planning a purchase order for manufacturing components.  
-   Planning a transfer order to fulfill sales demand.  
-   Planning a production order for a multilevel item.  

## Roles  
 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks performed by the following user roles:  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Sales Order Processor  

## Prerequisites  
 Before you begin this walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following modifications must be made to the database:  

-   Delete all existing sales orders for bicycles.  
-   Create one sales order for 10 bicycles at EAST location.  
-   Delete all planned and firm planned production orders. Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted.  

 As a rule, use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records.  

## Story  
 Eduardo, the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company, is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand.  

 Because the products have few BOM levels and the flow of orders is relatively low, Eduardo uses the **Order Planning** page to manually create supply orders, one product level at a time.  

 In a more complex manufacturing environment, the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period, safety lead time, reorder point, and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels.  

## Setting Up the Sample Data  
 The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand. During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough, you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates.  

## Use the Order Planning Page  

The **Order Planning** page can be accessed from several different locations:  

-   Manufacturing, Planning  
-   Sales & Marketing, Order Processing  
-   Purchase, Planning  
-   In addition, you can open this page for a specific production order by choosing the **Planning** action.

### To use the Order Planning page  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  

     When the **Order Planning** page first opens, a plan must be calculated to show the new demand since it was last calculated.  

2.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced, such as new sales, changed sales, or production orders.  

     Based on total availability, the quantity needed for each demand line is calculated. This calculation is performed order-by-order. This means that the order which includes the demand line with the earliest due date or shipment date will be calculated first. After that, additional demand lines will be calculated in the same order, regardless of the due date or shipment date.  

3.  Be sure that the **Order Planning** page is maximized and that column fields are resized to show all the default field names.  

     When the calculation is completed, the page displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date.  

     Notice that CRONUS has several orders with unfulfilled demand. Each bold planning line represents an order, sales order, or production order, including at least one order line with insufficient availability.  

4.  In the **Show Demand As** field, select the **All Demand** filter.  

     With the **Demand Type** field, you can choose which order types that you want to display.  

     Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown. If no orders exist when a plan is calculated, a message will display and no planning lines will appear.  

## Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand  
 In this procedure, you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components.  

### To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production  

1.  Expand the first line (choose the + symbol).  
2.  Choose the first demand line, with item **LSU-15**, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  
3.  Close the opened production order to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
4.  In the **Replenishment System** field, select **Purchase**.  

     The default value is from the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of the following options:  

    -   **Purchase** – To create a purchase order.  
    -   **Transfer** – To create a transfer order.  
    -   **Prod. Order** – To create a production order.  

5.  In the **Supply From** field, select one of the following options according to the selected replenishment system:  

    -   **Vendor** – For purchases  
    -   **Location** – For transfers  

     If the field is not filled in, an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the components have a default vendor number set up on the item cards, the lines will be preset.  

6.  Choose the **Supply From**  field.  
7.  On the **Item Vendor Catalogue** page, choose the **New** action, and then select vendor **30000**.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
9. Copy vendor **30000** to the other lines for loudspeaker components on this production order.  

     You are now ready to create a purchase order.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
11. On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **Active Order** option.  
12. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Purchase Order** field, choose the **Make Purch. Order** option.  
13. Choose the **OK** button to create purchase orders for all the components of the order.  

     The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders.  

## Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan for demand from a sales order. Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines, as in production demand.  

### To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Move the pointer to the planning line for order **2008**.  
2.  Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line.  

     Sales order **2008** is for ten loudspeakers, item **LS-120**, ordered by John Haddock Insurance Co.  

     The item's defined replenishment system and default vendor will display.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  At the bottom of the page, there are four information fields. In the **Earliest Date Available** field, the ten pieces that are needed will be available, on an inbound supply order, nine days later than the current due date. If this is too late for the customer, the **Available for Transfer** field shows 13 pieces of the item at another location. You will want to plan for this stock.  

3.  Choose the **Available for Transfer** field to open the **Get Alternative Supply** page.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to book the ten items that are available.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the demand line, the suggested purchase has been exchanged with a transfer from MAIN location. The **Make Orders** function creates a transfer order from MAIN to the demanded location. The **Substitutes Exists** field works in the same way.  

5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
6.  On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **The Active Order** option.  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Transfer Order** field, select the **Make Trans. Orders** option.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to create the transfer order to supply the sales order.  

     The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders.  

## Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels, each creating dependent production demand.  

### To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Select the planning line with sales demand for order **1001**, created earlier as prerequisite data.  

     This demand is a sales line, but the item has a defined replenishment system of **Prod. Order**. Proceed to add an extra bell to the component need of each bicycle.  

2.  Choose the **Components** action to open the **Planning Components** page.  
3.  On the line with the Bell item, change the **Quantity per** field from **1** to **2**.  
4.  On the **Order Planning** page, consider your planning alternatives. In this case, you have no alternative means of supply, no transfer, substitute, or later delivery. You must create the suggested supply order, a production order.  
5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action to create the production order.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, notice that the planning line for sales order **1001** no longer exists and that the initial sales demand has been covered.  

6.  Close the **Order Planning** page.  

     Now, you could choose to stay in this view and complete all the planning tasks. Instead, you will now take on the Production Planner role by going to the production order that you just created and access the **Order Planning** page.  

 As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order.  

### To plan a specific production order  

1.  Open the production order **101001**, for ten bicycles, that you just created by using the **Make Orders** function.  
2.  Open the **Prod. Order Components** page to check that the extra bell is reflected on the production order.  
3.  Choose the **Planning** action.  

     The **Order Planning** page opens in a view that is always filtered on the specific production demand. Sales demand is not displayed. You must calculate a plan before you can see any additional demand.  

4.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     Notice that four new production orders appear as unplanned production demand derived from order **101001**. The new lines represent new production demand from the subassemblies that must be created to produce the order.  

5.  Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the production demand for the production orders.  

     To provide additional information about the demand lines, you may want to add the **Demand Quantity** and **Demand Qty. Available** fields to your view.  

     Now you must supply ten of each component.  

     Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod. Order. These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle.  

     The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders.  

6.  Choose the **Make Orders** action.  

     Before you choose the **OK** button, notice the text on the **Order Planning** FastTab. This text is important because you know that the bicycle has several produced components, subassemblies, in its product structure that might be in demand when you create this production order.  

7.  On the **Make Supply Order** page, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button to create production orders for the second product level of the order.  

     Note that the top-level production demand for production order 101001 no longer exists. This means that the initial production demand for subassemblies has been planned for.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, you calculate a plan again in order to plan the bicycle structure.  

8.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action to recalculate the plan as instructed by the embedded Help text.  

     The two new lines represent additional production demand derived from the subassemblies planned in the previous steps. It is suggested that you make two production orders to supply the wheel hubs, one for 10 front hubs and one for 10 back hubs.  

9. Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the demand for the two production orders.  

     The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components. You decide to make the proposed orders.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action.  
11. In the **Make Orders for** field, select the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button. Check if additional demand exists for the production of the parent item, the bicycle, which is being sold on sales order 1001.  
12. Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The message indicates that all required items are now supplied. Verify the firm planned production orders that are created.  

13. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

     On the **Firm Planned Prod. Orders** page review how start times and end times of individual orders are scheduled according to the product structure. The lowest-level components are produced first. Therefore, you must plan multilevel orders as demonstrated in this planning workflow.

# Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central

If you use [!INCLUDE [crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities:

* Process orders
* Manage inventory
* Do your finances

Before you can use the integration capabilities, your system administrator must set up the connection and define users in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These steps describe the process of integrating online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about on-premises configurations, go to [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

Integrating the applications lets you access data in Sales from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in some cases the other way around. You can work with and synchronize data that both services have in common. For example, customers, contacts, and sales information. Synchronization keeps data up to date in both applications.  

For example, a sales person in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] can use the price lists from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when they create a sales order. When they add the item to the sales order line in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], they can check the inventory level (availability) of the item from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Conversely, order processors in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can handle sales orders that are automatically or manually transferred from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, they can create and post sales order lines for items or resources that were entered in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] as write-in products. To learn more, go to [Handling Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates only with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Other Dynamics 365 applications that change the standard workflow or data model in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example Project Service Automation, can break the integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

## Couple records

The assisted setup guide lets you choose the data to synchronize. Later, you can also set up synchronization for specific records, which is referred to as *coupling*. For example, you can couple a specific account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with a specific customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This section describes what to consider when you couple records.

For example, if you want to see accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must couple the two types of records. To do that, on the **Customers** list page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Set Up Coupling** action. Then specify which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to match to which accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

You can also create (and couple) an account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] based on, for example, a customer record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using **Create Account in Dynamics 365 Sales**, or vice versa, using **Create Customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.

When you set up coupling between two records, you can also manually request current record, for example a customer, to be overwritten immediately by account data from Sales (or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) using **Synchronize Now** action. The **Synchronize Now** action asks whether to overwrite Sales or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record data.

In some cases you must couple certain sets of data before other sets of data, as shown in the following table.

|Data|What to couple first|
|-----|----|
|Customers and accounts|Couple salespeople with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] users|
|Items and resources|Couple units of measure with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] unit groups|
|Items and resource prices|Couple customer price groups with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] prices|

> [!NOTE]  
> If your prices or customers use foreign currencies, make sure that you couple currencies to Sales transaction currencies.

In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], sales orders depend on information such as customers, units of measure, currencies, customer price groups, and items and/or resources. For the integration with sales orders to work you must couple customers, units of measure, currencies, customer price groups, and items and/or resources.

## Fully synchronize records

At the end of the assisted setup guide, you can choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action to start synchronizing all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records with all related records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. On the **Dynamics 365 Sales Full Synch Review** page, you choose the **Start** action. Full synchronization can take some time to complete, but you can continue to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while it runs in the background.

To check the progress of individual jobs in a full synchronization, on the **Dynamics 365 Sales Full Synch Review** page, choose a record to view details. To update the status during synchronization, refresh the page.

From the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, you can get details about full synchronization at any time. From here, you can also open the **Integration Table Mappings** page to see details about the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Sales that must be synchronized.

## Synchronize on a recurring schedule

The integration provides a few default jobs in the job queue that synchronize data for you. The jobs synchronize data every 30 minutes, but you can change that schedule. To learn more about the default synchronization jobs, go to [Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronization-jobs-for-a-sales-integration). To learn more about the job queue, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Handle sales order data

Sales orders that people submit in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] transfer to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] if you select the **Automatically Create Sales Orders** checkbox on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.

Alternatively, you can manually convert submitted sales orders from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] by using the **Create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action on the **Sales Orders - Dynamics 365 for Sales** page.

On such sales orders, the **Name** field on the original order is transferred and mapped to the **External Document Number** field on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The same is true if the original sales order contains write-in products, meaning items or resources that aren't registered in either app. In that case, you must fill in the **Write-in Product Type** and **Write-in Product No.** fields on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page so that sales of nonregistered products are mapped to a specified item or resource number.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't map write-ins to items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are coupled with a product in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To allow for write-ins, we recommend that you create an item or resource specifically for that purpose, and don't couple it with a product in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

If the description of the item on the original sales order is long, another sales order line of the type **Comment** is created to hold the full text on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Updates to fields on sales order headers, such as the **Last Shipment Date** or **Requested Delivery Date** fields, that are mapped in the **SALESORDER-ORDER** integration table mapping periodically synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Processes such as releasing, shipping, and invoicing a sales order are posted to the sales order timeline in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. When sales orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are completely shipped, the **Last Shipment Date** field updates, and the status of the order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is set to **Fulfilled**. For more information, see [Introduction to activity feeds](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/manage-activities). To learn how to enable posting and activities for orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], go to [Set up the Notes control to access information about posts for a custom entity](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/customize/notes-control-legacy) in the Customer Engagement documentation. The article refers to Customer Engagement on-premises, but the steps are the same for the online version.

> [!NOTE]  
> Periodical synchronization based on the **SALESORDER-ORDER** integration table mapping works only when sales order integration is enabled. To learn more, go to [Connection settings on the Sales Connection Setup Page](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md). Only sales orders created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize. To learn more, go to [Enable Sales Order Processing Integration](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/developer/enable-sales-order-processing-integration).

<!--> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft] -->

If someone changes the price of a product in [!INCLUDE [crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and you include the item in sales orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new sales price list for each order. To learn more about price lists, go to [Handle sales prices](#handle-sales-prices).

Sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize when their status is **Submitted**. Sales orders from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize when their status is **Released**. The exception to this rule is when a prepayment is needed to complete a sales order in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If an order is waiting prepayment, sales orders from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize with a status of **Open** to let you complete the prepayment process. When you register the prepayment, the sales order's status changes to **Released** and synchronization continues.

## Handle sales quotes data

Sales quotes that are activated in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] are transferred to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] if you select the **Automatically Process Quotes** checkbox on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.

Alternatively, you can manually convert activated sales quotes from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] by using the **Process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action on the **Sales Quotes - Dynamics 365 Sales** page.
On such sales quotes, the **Name** field on the original quote is transferred and mapped to the **External Document Number** field on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also **Effective To** field on quote is transferred and mapped to the  **Quote Valid Until** field on sales quote in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Sales quotes go through many revisions while they're being finalized. Both manual and automatic processing of sales quotes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that previous versions of sales quotes are archived before processing new revisions of sales quotes from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

When you choose **Process** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for a quote that is in state **Won**, a sales order is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only if a corresponding sales order is submitted in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Otherwise, the quote is only released in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a corresponding sales order is submitted in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] later, and a sales order is created from it, the **Quote No.** is updated on the sales order and the quote is archived.

## Handle posted sales invoices, customer payments, and statistics

After you fulfill a sales order, invoices are created for it. When you invoice a sales order, you can transfer the posted sales invoice to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] if you select the **Create Invoice in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]** checkbox on the **Posted Sales Invoice** page. Posted invoices transfer to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with the status, **Billed**.

When the customer payment is received for the sales invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the sales invoice status changes to **Paid**. The **Status Reason** field is set to **Partial**, if partially paid, or **Complete** if fully paid, when you choose the **Update Account Statistics** action on the Customer Card page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Update Account Statistics** action refreshes values, such as the **Balance** and **Total Sales** fields in the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Account Statistics** FactBox in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Alternatively, you can run the Customer Statistics and POSTEDSALESINV-INV scheduled jobs for both of these processes in the background.

## Handle sales prices

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your administrator enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The steps to complete this process differ, depending on whether your administrator enabled the new pricing experience.

> [!NOTE]
> If the standard price synchronization doesn't work for you, we recommend using integration customization capabilities. To learn more, go to [Customizing an Integration with Microsoft Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/administration-custom-cds-integration).

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)
In the current pricing experience, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes sales prices that: 

* Apply to all customers. Default sales price lists are created based on the price in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** page for the items.
* Apply to a specific customer price group. For example, sales prices for your retail or wholesale customers. To synchronize prices based on a customer price group, follow these steps:

    1. Couple the items for which the customer price group sets prices.
    2. On the **Customer Price Groups** page, couple the customer price group by choosing **Related**, then **Dynamics 365 Sales**, **Coupling**, and then **Set up coupling**. The coupling creates an active price list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the same name as the customer price group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. It also automatically synchronizes all items for which the customer price group defines the price.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-price-group.png" alt-text="Customer Price Group page.":::

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

The new pricing experience synchronizes price lists that meet the following criteria:

* **Allow Updating Defaults** is turned off.
* The price type is **Sale**.
* The amount type is **Price**.
* The product type on the lines must be **Item** or **Resource**. 
* A minimum quantity isn't specified.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes sales prices that apply to all customers. Default sales price lists are created based on the price in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** page for the items.

To synchronize price lists, on the **Sales Price List** page, choose **Related**, **Dynamics 365 Sales**, **Coupling**, and then **Set up coupling**.

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About this walkthrough  

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use the **Inventory Put-away** page to record and post put-away and receipt information for your inbound source documents. The following documents are inbound source documents:

* Purchase order
* Sales return order
* Inbound transfer order
* Production order with output that's ready to be put away

> [!NOTE]
> Even though the settings are called **Require Pick** and **Require Put-away**, you can still post receipts and shipments directly from the source business documents at locations where you select these checkboxes.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

* Set up SILVER location for inventory put aways.  
* Set up SILVER location for bin handling.  
* Define a default bin for item LS-81. (LS-75 is already set up in CRONUS.)  
* Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 for 40 loudspeakers.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are preset by setup.  
* Release the purchase order for warehouse handling.  
* Create an inventory put-away based on a released source document.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are inherited from the purchase order.  
* Register the warehouse movement into the warehouse and post the purchase receipt for the source purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Roles  

The following user roles perform the tasks that this walkthrough demonstrates:  

* Warehouse Manager  
* Purchasing Agent  
* Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites  

To complete this walkthrough, you'll need:  

* CRONUS International Ltd. data  
* To be a warehouse employee at SILVER location. To set yourself up, follow these steps:  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your user account on the **Users** page.  
    3. In the **Location Code** field, choose **SILVER**.  
    4. Select the **Default** checkbox.  

## Story  

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS International Ltd., creates a purchase order for 10 units of item LS-75 and 30 units of item LS-81 from vendor 10000 to be delivered to SILVER Warehouse. When the delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, puts the items away in the default bins defined for the items. When John posts the put-away, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

## Setting up the location  

Settings on the **Location Card** page define the company's warehouse flows.  

### To set up the location  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the SILVER location card.  
3. Turn on the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

    Set up a default bin for the two item numbers to control where they're put away.  

4. Choose the **Bins** action.  
5. Select the first row, for bin **S-01-0001**, and then choose the **Contents** action.  

    Notice on the **Bin Content** page that item **LS-75** is already set up as content in bin S-01-0001.  

6. Choose the **New** action.  
7. Select the **Fixed** and the **Default** fields.  
8. In the **Item No.** field, enter **LS-81**.  

## Create the purchase order  

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Bin code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |LS_75|SILVER|S-01-0001|10|  
    |LS-81|SILVER|S-01-0001|30|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The bin code is entered automatically according to the setup you created in the [Setting up the location](#setting-up-the-location) section.  

    Next, notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    The delivery of loudspeakers from vendor 10000 has arrived at SILVER warehouse, and John proceeds to put them away.  

## Receive and put the items away  

Use the **Inventory Put-away** page to manage all inbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive and put the items away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Purchase Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the purchase from vendor 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the purchase order.  

5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 30 respectively on the two inventory put-away lines.  

6. Choose the **Post** action, select the **Receive** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 40 loudspeakers are now registered as put away in bin S-01-0001, and a positive item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted purchase receipt.

# Record sustainability entries

You can manually record greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or water and waste intensity in the sustainability ledger by using sustainability journals. You can also use purchase documents or general journals to record GHG emissions.  

<!--> [!NOTE]
> Posting water and waste intensity and using general journals for posting emissions will be enabled starting *2025 release wave 1*.  -->

## Sustainability journals

Sustainability journals are designed to track and record sustainability-related activities by using the same user experience as other journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually enter emissions and water or waste intensity in a journal. Alternatively, if you don't have the information, you can use built-in formulas to accurately calculate emissions or water or waste intensity based on parameters that correspond to various types of sources and accounts.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in that journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where it can't be changed. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries.

### Use journal templates and batches

By default, there are standard and recurring sustainability journal templates.

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. To do so, select the **Batches** action on the **Sustainability Journal Templates** page, and then create the new **Sustainability Journal Batch** on the new page. For example, you can define your own journal batch for each emission scope by using the **Emission Scope** option and then selecting among the four existing scopes or **Water/Waste** option. For each batch, you can add or change the **Source Code** and **Reason Code** values.

> [!TIP]
> If you have many lines, you can help reduce the risk of mistakes by having one journal batch for each emission type. Alternatively, you can use the common batch for all emission types.

### Validate sustainability journals

On the **Sustainability Setup** page, you can turn on a background check to help prevent posting delays. If any mistakes occur while you work in the sustainability journal, the validation notifies you and prevents you from posting the journal.

When you enable the validation, the **Journal Check** FactBox shows issues on the current line and in the whole batch. Validation occurs when you load a journal batch and when you select another journal line. The **Issues Total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found. You can select the tile to open an overview of the issues.

### Work with sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you plan to post in the same batch.
3. For internal documents, you can leave the **Document Type** field blank. If not, you can select **Invoice**, **Credit Memo**, or **GHG Credit**.  
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use a batch where the emission scope is configured, the **Emission Scope** value in the sustainability account must equal the **Emission Scope** value in the batch.

5. You can either manually fill in the emission amounts or use formulas.

    - If you have accurate information about gas emission or water or waste intensity and want to post it (that is, if you have the information on the received invoice, or some other measured model), select the **Manual Input** field to indicate that you manually enter the amounts. In this case, you can't enter your data directly in the **Fuel/Electricity**, **Distance**, **Custom Amount**, **Installation Multiplier**, and **Time Factor** fields because they become uneditable. However, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields remain editable, and you can enter your data directly in them.
    - If you don't have accurate knowledge of the gas emission or water or waste intensity and must calculate it, don't select the **Manual Input** field. In this case, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields become uneditable. However, you can enter your calculation details based on the formula that you're using. To learn more about the formulas that are defined in the **sustainability account category**, go to [Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger](finance-sustainability-accounts-ledger.md#account-categories).  

6. To post the journal, select the **Post** action. When you post in a sustainability journal, entries are generated in the sustainability ledger.

> [!NOTE]
> For water and waste intensity calculation, you can only use a formula with the **Custom Amount** that's multiplied with the emission factor from the **Sustainability Account Subcategory**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your formula is based on the **Calculate from General Ledger** option in the sustainability account category, you must use the **Collect Amount from G/L Entries** action before you post the journal. The action calculates emissions based on this data source. Additionally, if you made changes to the emission factors after the journal lines were filled in, you must select the **Recalculate** action to get the correct amount in the journal.

### Changing account subcategories in the journal line  

You can have more than one **Account Subcategory** related to one **Sustainability Account**, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting. To use a different subcategory for each account, you can easily change this value on the **Sustainability Journal** line, but you can only select subcategories that are already associated with the specific account and account category.

> [!TIP]
> Here's an example. You want to use one account for different types of cars, but the cars have different emission factors. You can set up one account and create an account subcategory for each emission factor. When you work in your sustainability journal, you can easily change your account subcategory based on the car type you choose to use for recording emissions.

### Recurring journals

A recurring journal is a sustainability journal that has specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. Examples include sustainability transactions such as electricity or heat, or other similar transactions. You can use recurring journals to post fixed and variable amounts.

When you use a recurring journal, you create the entries that you regularly post only one time. Information such as the accounts, dimensions, and dimension values remain in the journal after posting. Each time that you post, you can make any changes that are needed.

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how the amount on the journal line is handled after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time that you post the line, you can select the **F Fixed** option to let the amount remain after posting. If you use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time that you post, you can select the **V Variable** option to delete the amount after posting.

The **Recurring Frequency** field is also important and must be set. It's a date formula field that determines how often the entry on the journal line is posted. Learn more in [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

The **Expiration Date** field determines the date when the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after that date. The advantage of using the **Expiration Date** field is that the line isn't immediately deleted from the journal. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future. If the field is blank, the line is posted every time, until you delete it from the journal.

## Purchase documents  

To enable recording of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in any purchase-related documents, you must select the **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** on the **Sustainability Setup** page. 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   - Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want the invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   - Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want the order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
2. Populate the header and lines based on the instructions in [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. If you have information about emissions on your invoice from the vendor, choose the appropriate **Sustainability Account No.** in the document lines and add emission values using one of the following fields (based on what you want to track and emissions you have on your physical invoice): **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, or **Emission N2O**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values you enter in the emission fields are fixed amounts per line. They aren't multiplied with the **Quantity** field. You can use **Sustainability Account No.** only when the **Type** field (**Option Values**) is **Item** or **G/L Account**. You can't use **Resource** or **Charge (Item)** **Option Values**. 

4. If you want to review total emissions before posting, you can open the statistics page and find the total posted emissions and emissions for posting per document (any purchase-related documents) on the **Sustainability** FastTab.
5. Post the documents and open a new **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
6. Select the **Find Entries** action. You have a **Sustainability Ledger Entry** as one of the related entries on the **Find entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post the document, for each of the purchase lines where you have **Sustainability Account No.**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an independent **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **Invoice** as a **Document Type** and the same **Document No.**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create and post a **Purchase Credit Memo** manually, or by using the **Cancel**, **Correct**, or **Create Corrective Credit Memo** actions, in which case [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the existing values from the posted invoice.  

## General journals

You can use general journals to post gas emissions together with the financial amounts. This option is used if you want to post your incoming invoices using journals and not documents. In this situation, you can [use general journals](ui-work-general-journals.md) as usual, but before posting journals, you should add emissions. There isn't an option to use formulas in general journals. After you select the right **Sustainability Account No.** for the journal line, you can add only total emission amounts in the **Total Emission CO2**, **Total Emission CH4**, or **Total Emission N2O** fields. After you post, lines are recorded in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** and if you included a carbon equivalent calculation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select the **Sustainability Account No.** in the journal line only if **Document Type** for this line is **Invoice** or **Credit Memo**. For all other options, you can't select the **Sustainability Account No.** and post emissions.

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Revalue general ledger account balances

If you use general ledger (G/L) accounts to register, balance sheet items in foreign currencies, you should revaluate the account balances before you produce financial statements. Currency exchange rates often change, and revaluation helps make your financial statements more accurate.

## Set up revaluations

You set up each account that you want to include in revaluations on the **G/L Account Card** page. You can select whether to post revaluation adjustments to realized or unrealized gains/losses accounts. Posting gains and losses during a currency exchange rate adjustment follows the normal posting routine. For example, you do it for each setup on the **Currencies** page. To learn more about exchange rate adjustments, go to [Update currency exchange rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

To minimize errors, in the **Source Currency Posting** field, you can set up a validation for the currencies that you want to allow to post to individual G/L accounts:

* All currencies (blank)
* Multiple currencies
* Same currency
* Local currency

## Run a revaluation

To revalue the foreign currency amounts in local currency for G/L account balances, on the **Chart of Accounts** page, use the **G/L Currency Revaluation** action to start a batch job. The batch job creates adjustment entries in the journal that you select. When you post the entries, you adjust the local currency (LCY) balance for the account. G/L account balances that always show in LCY now reflect changes to the currencies in which entries were posted. This revaluation enables you to produce a more accurate financial statement with less effort.

If you're using an additional reporting currency (ACY), the G/L revaluation entries have an ACY amount. The amount only corresponding to the LCY amount on these entries, not the ACY balance on the G/L account. If you adjust the ACY rates after you post the adjustments, run the currency exchange rate adjustment one more time to adjust all G/L entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

> [!NOTE]
> Revaluation doesn’t provide the ability to apply or unapply entries, like you can with customer and vendor ledger entries. Adjustments happen on a balance per currency basis.

## Revaluate accounts vs. customer and vendor exchange rate adjustments

Revaluation simplifies the task of adjusting G/L account balances. The feature revaluates the balance per currency per G/L account much like you do for adjustments to G/L accounts that are linked to bank accounts. If you use a G/L account to track multiple assets, consider using a vendor or customer account instead.

> [!NOTE]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

The following examples illustrate the difference between using a G/L account and using a vendor account to track the balance of two monetary assets that use a foreign currency.

**Use a G/L account**
If you're using one G/L account to track either multiple assets (for example, loans or fixed assets) in the same currency, or individual part transactions for the same asset but still in the same currency, G/L revaluation makes one entry per revaluation for the currency. This means that you can't track the adjustments related to individual assets or individual transactions for the same asset.

**Use a vendor account**
If you set up multiple assets as vendors and you post transactions to them, either in same or different currencies, you'll get an adjustment per currency per vendor. Or, if you turn on the **Posting per entry** toggle on the **Adjust Currency Exchange Rate** job queue entry, you'll get an adjustment entry for each separate vendor ledger entry.

This difference is important when you assess whether G/L revaluation is the right feature to you for your reporting needs.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you ask your accountant or auditor which type of account is best for your business. Also, there might be an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=dynamics-365-business-central) that's just right for your business scenarios.

# <a name="default"></a>Specify a default printer  

After printers have been set up in Business Central, you can then specify which printer you want to use by default for all companies in the environment. There are a couple of ways to specify printers to be used by default for reports and other print jobs. A default printer is useful if you work with different reports that require different printers because of their placement or their output capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only printers that you can specify as default are **Microsoft Print to PDF** and cloud printers that have already been set up for use in Business Central, like Email printers and Universal Print printers. Cloud printers are typically set up by an admin. For more information, see [Printer Setup and Management](admin-printer-setup-overview.md).

## Set a printer as a default printer for all print jobs

Through the **Printer Management** page you set up a printer as a default printer for all print jobs. You can specify the printer as default for you only or for all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the **Printer Management** page from the **Printer Selections** page by choosing **Printer Management**.  
2. On the **Printer Management** page, select a printer from the list, choose **Manage**, then choose **Set as my default printer** or **Set as default printer for all users**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting a default printer from the **Printer Management** adds an entry in the **Printer Selections**.

## Set a default printer for specific reports

The **Printer Selections** page lets you specify the printer a report use by default. Default printers are set on a user-account basis. You can set a default printer for just yourself, another user, or all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Selections**, then select the related link. Alternatively, select a printer on the **Printer Management** page, then choose the **Printer Selections** action.
2. Choose the **New** action to add a printer selection for a specific report.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

The specified report is now set up to print to the selected printer by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When you print the report in question, you can select a different using the **Print** field on the report request page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't set a report up for a specific printer on the **Printer Selections** page, then it's printed to the default printer, as defined on the **Printer Management** page.

You or the administrator can also use the **Printer Selections** page to define other variations of printing for users and reports. The following table describes the combination of values to specify different printing setups for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Print a report to a specific printer for all users |Specify values in the **Report ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **User ID** field blank.|
|Print all reports to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in the **User ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **Report ID** field blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as my default printer** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Set the default printer for all reports for all users|Specify a value in the **Printer Name** field and leave the **User ID** and **Report ID** fields blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as default printer for all users** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Print a specific report to the user's default printer|Specify a value in the **Report ID** field and leave the **Printer Name** and **User ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in all three fields.|

> [!NOTE]
> More specific printer selections take precedence over more general printer selections. For example, a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

## Choosing the printer when running a report

Instead of using the default printer when running a report, you can override this setting from the request page. Simply choose the printer you want to use for this report generation in the **Printer** dropdown menu.

## Sizing print jobs

Cloud printing is designed for documents of a reasonable size. Most cloud services, including PrintNode and HP ePrint, have a limit of 10 MB per job. If you need to print larger reports, you may have to split them in multiple printouts.

# Register Employees

To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first add each employee by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page.

## Adding new employees

You can add new employees manually, by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a templates for different types of employee profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new employees, and helps ensure that the information is correct each time. If you create templates for more than one type of employee, you can choose the template to use when you add an employee. If you create only one template it will be used for all new employees. After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected employees. To create a template, you fill in the information that you want to reuse on the Employee Card page, and then save it as a template.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Employee Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping employee records up-to-date can simplify personnel-related tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the Employee Card page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab on the **Employee Card** page. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

## To set up an employee

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Employee Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To insert a picture of an employee

If you have a picture of an employee, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. In the **Employee Picture** FactBox, choose the drop-down button, and then choose **Import**.
4. On the **Select a picture to upload** page, then do one of the following steps to upload the picture file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The picture is inserted in the **Employee Picture** FactBox.

## To register various information about an employee

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employees’ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. Choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
4. **In the Alternate Address List** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat step 4 for each alternate address.

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::

|Select...|To...|See more info...|
|---------|-----|----------------|
|Open in OneDrive|Copy the file to a Business Central folder in your OneDrive and open the file.|[Open in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#open-in-onedrive) |
|Share|Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.|[Share in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#share) |

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample financial reports you can use right away as templates. You can also set up your own reports to specify the figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins using dimensions such as departments or customer groups. The number of financial reports you can create is unlimited and require no involvement of a developer.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. There are three key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

- Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
- Design how you use dimensions.
- Set up G/L budgets.

G/L account categories simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

Setting up dimensions allows you to slice and dice your financial data in ways that make sense for your organization. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

If you want to view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries, you must create G/L budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Financial reports

Financial reports arrange accounts from your chart of accounts in ways that make data easier to present. You can set up various layouts to define the information you want to extract from the chart of accounts. Financial reports also provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. Another example is to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. Additionally, you can filter general ledger entries and budget entries, for example, by net change or debit amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Mathematically, think of a financial report as defined by two things:
>
> - A vector of row definitions that define what needs to be calculated.
> - A vector of column definitions that defines the data for the calculation.
>
> The financial report is then the outer product of these two vectors, where each cell value is calculated according to the formula in the row applied to the data definition from the column.

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-report-definition.svg" alt-text="Shows how a financial report is constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-report-definition.svg":::

The **Financial Reports** page shows how all financial reports follow a pattern that consists of the following attributes:

- Name (code)
- Description
- Row definition
- Column definition
- Internal description (introduced in [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)])

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-reports.png" alt-text="Shows how all financial reports are constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-reports.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending of the way you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, you need to adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports they're used in to match your setup.

You can also use formulas to compare two or more financial reports and column definitions. Comparisons let can do the following things:

- Create customized financial reports.
- Create as many financial reports as you need, each with a unique name.
- Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.

To learn more about comparisons, go to [When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition](bi-design-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-a-comparison-period-formula-and-comparison-date-formula-in-a-column-definition).

## Learning path: Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Want to learn how to create budgets, and then use financial reports, dimensions, and row and column definitions to generate the financial reports that businesses typically need?

Start on the following learning path [Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/training/paths/create-financial-reports-dynamics-365-business-central).

## Create a new financial report

You use financial reports to analyze general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

The financial reports in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not suit your business needs. To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 below.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name. Alternatively, to reuse settings from an existing financial report, choose the report, and then choose the **Copy Report Definition** action.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a short name for the report

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't change the name later.
1. In the **Display Title** field, enter a description of the report.
1. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
1. Optionally, choose analysis views for the row and column definitions.
1. Choose the **View Financial Report** action to access more properties on the financial report.
1. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report title, change the row and column definitions, write an internal description, set the formatting for negative numbers, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
1. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.
1. If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, add them from the *Definitions* menu (these fields are available from the [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)] and later).  
1. You can now preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open a financial report in View or Edit mode, the Filter pane is available. Don't use the Filter pane to set filters for the data in your report. Such filters can cause errors or might not actually filter the data. Instead, use the fields on the **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs to set up filters for the report.

### Adding introductory and/or closing paragraphs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, you can use the **Edit introductory/closing paragraphs** action on the **Definitions** menu. When you export the report to PDF or Excel, these paragraphs display before and after the report body.

### Choosing a format for negative numbers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want to control how negative numbers show in the report output (both on-screen and in PDF), you use the **Negative Amount Format** action on the **Options** FastTab to choose your preferred format. The format can be a minus sign or parentheses.

### Create or edit a row definition

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

Row definitions also provide settings for formatting your report. Most of the options provide visual definition to reports when people view or preview them on their monitors, or print them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over when you export them to Excel. If you often export reports to Excel, you might skip the formatting here and format the report in Excel instead.

To learn more, go to [Row definitions in financial reporting](bi-row-definitions.md).

### Create or edit a column definition

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in the report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

To learn more, go to [Column definitions in financial reporting](bi-column-definitions.md).

## Using dimensions in financial reports

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement that compares general ledger figures with budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action  
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action.  
1. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

    The accounts are inserted in your financial report. If you want, you can also change the column definition.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.  
1. On the **Financial Report** page, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the filter name you want to use.  
1. Choose **OK**.  

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.  

## Best practices for working with financial report definitions

Financial report definitions aren't versioned. When you change a report definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with financial report definitions:

- If you add report definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the report for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with the report and perhaps changing the report definition.
- Before you change a report definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial report definitions

You can import and export financial report definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report definitions, existing records with the same names as those you are importing are replaced with the new definitions. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report, then choose the **Import Financial Report** or **Export Financial Report** action, depending on what you want to do.

To learn more about how to import or export financial report row or column definitions, go to the following articles: 

- [Import or export financial reporting row definitions](bi-row-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions), or
- [Import or export financial reporting column definitions](bi-column-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions)

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

To learn more, go to [How to integrate financial reports with Excel](finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#integrate-financial-reports-with-excel).

## Print and save financial reports

You can print financial reports using your device's printing services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers options to save reports as PDF files. 

To learn more, go to [How to print and save financial reports](./finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#print-and-save-financial-reports).

# Analyzing sustainability entries with financial reports

The *financial reports* feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. But you can also analyze statistical and sustainability data with the same feature, and even combine all three types of data.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting  

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of the data you want to analyze. There are some key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

1. Related to the chart of accounts:

   1. Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.
   3. Set up G/L budgets.  

2. Related to sustainability:

   1. Set up your sustainability accounts.
   2. Set up your carbon fees and CO2e in the **Emission Fees**.
   3. Design how you use dimensions.  

3. Related to the statistical accounts:

   1. Set up your statistical accounts.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.  

> [!NOTE]
> Financial reports doesn't work directly with CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions. Instead, it uses the CO2 equivalent model and that means you must first configure **CO2e** (carbon-dioxide equivalent) on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> More details about using financial reports with financial data and chart of accounts can be found at [Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Create a new financial report  

To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 here:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name.  
3. Fill in the report short name in **Name** field (you can't change the name later) and enter a **Description**.  
4. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
5. Choose the **Edit Report Definition** action to access more properties on the financial report.  
6. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report description, change the row and column definitions, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
7. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.  
8. You can preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

If you want to analyze your sustainability or statistical data, you can achieve this by setting up the **Row Definition**.  

To create or edit a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the relevant financial report, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. If you add elements with identifiers that start with the same 10 characters, you'll have duplicates in the **Row No.** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements. The full identifiers are displayed in the **Totaling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine all **Totaling Types**, that is, Posting accounts, Sust. Accounts, and Statistical Account.

> [!NOTE]
> Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced and your changes will be saved to the database.

### Analyzing sustainability data  

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Sust. Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. In the **Amount Type** choose one of the options:
   1. Choose **CO2e** if you want to report CO2 equivalent value from the **CO2e Emission** field in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.
   2. Choose **Carbon Fee** if you want to report financial equivalent (carbon fee) from the **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

5. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.  

### Analyzing statistical data

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Statistical Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.

# Troubleshoot synchronization errors

There are lots of moving parts involved in integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and sometimes things go wrong. This article points out some of the typical errors that occur and gives some pointers for how to fix them.

Errors often occur either because of something that a user did to coupled records, or something is wrong with how the integration is set up. For errors related to coupled records, users can resolve them themselves. Causes for these errors are often actions, such as deleting data in one, but not both, business apps and then synchronizing. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).

Errors that are related to how the integration is set up typically require an administrator's attention. You can view these errors on the **Integration Synchronization Errors** page. 

The following table provides examples of typical issues:  

|Issue  |Resolution  |
|---------|---------|
|The permissions and roles assigned to the integration user aren't correct. | This error comes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and it often includes the following text, **Principal user (Id=\<user id>, type=8) is missing \<privilegeName> privilege**. This error happens because the integration user is missing a privilege that allows it to access an entity. Typically, this error happens if you're synchronizing custom entities, or if you have an app installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that requires permission to access other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. To resolve this error, assign the permission to the integration user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].<br><br> You can find the integration user name on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The error message provides the name of the permission, which can help you identify the entity for which you need permission. To add the missing privilege, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with an administrator account and edit the security role assigned to the integration user. For more information, see [Create or edit a security role to manage access](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role). |
|You're coupling a record that uses another record that isn't coupled. For example, a customer whose currency isn't coupled or an item for which the unit of measure isn't coupled. | You must first couple the dependent record, for example, a currency or unit of measure, and then retry the coupling. |
|Your connection to Dataverse paused during synchronization. For example, because your session timed out. When that happens, the following error displays when you resume your session: _Table connection for table type CRM must be registered using RegisterTableConnection or cmdlet New-NAVTableConnection before it can be used._|* For session timeouts, refresh the page to reconnect to Dataverse. The error message disappears.<br><br>* For an issue in the code, for example, if you're using a custom page to show data from a Dataverse entity, contact your Microsoft partner or support. When you do, use the **Copy details** action to share details about the error. |
|User does not have required privileges (or role membership) to access the org when it is in Admin Only mode.|You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins). 
Data synchronization doesn't work on Dataverse environments in Administration mode. Learn how to disable Administration mode in [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode#set-administration-mode).|

The following are some tools on the Integration Synchronization Errors page that can help you manually resolve these issues.  

* The **Source** and **Destination** fields can contain links to the row where the error was found. Choose the link to investigate the error.  
* The **Delete Entries Older than 7 Days** and the **Delete All Entries** actions clean up the list. Typically, you use these actions after you resolve the cause of an error that affects many records. Use caution, however. These actions might delete errors that are still relevant.
* The **Show Error Call Stack** action shows information that can help identify the cause of the error. If you can't resolve the error yourself and you decide to submit a support request, include the information in the support request.

# Make sales quotes

You create a sales quote to record your offer to a customer or a prospect to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can send the sales quote to the customer to communicate the offer. You can email the document as a PDF attachment. You can also have the email body prefilled with a summary of the quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).

While you negotiate with the customer or prospect, you can change and resend the sales quote as much as needed. When the customer accepts the quote, you convert the sales quote to a sales invoice or a sales order in which you process the sale. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

In most cases, you send sales quotes to prospective customers. You often have a contact person that you negotiate with. If they then accept your offer, you turn the sales quote into an order and register the prospect as a customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the following procedure, we focus on contacts, but you can also send quotes to existing customers.  

## To create a sales quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Specify the contact or customer that you want to send the sales quote to.

    - If the sales quote is for an existing contact, then specify the name in the **Contact No.** field.  

        If the sales quote is for an existing customer, specify the customer in the **Customer** field.
    - If the contact isn't registered, follow these steps:

        1. In the **Contact No.** field, choose the edit button :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false":::.
        2. In the dialog box about selecting the contact, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the relevant fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).  
        3. When you have completed the contact card, select the newly created contact in the list of contacts, and then choose the OK button to return to the sales quote.

        Several fields on the sales quote are now filled with information that you specified on the new contact card.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To correctly calculate taxes and prices for a quote, you must choose the relevant customer template in the **Customer Template Code** field. The template will be used to convert the contact to a customer once the quote is converted to a sales order or invoice.
    -  If the quote is for new customer, you must add the customer. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Quote** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    You're now ready to fill in the sales lines for products that you're selling or for any transaction with the customer or prospect that you want to record in a G/L account.  

    If you have set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you'll post for the customer with the sales line.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field empty in the following cases:
    - If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    - If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. For more information, see [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the item is of type **Service**, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. For more information, see [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* x *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, the price and amount on the sales line automatically update if the price criteria is met. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product you want to offer the contact.

    The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines.  
9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you have set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > To have the **Quote Valid Until Date** filled in automatically with a certain number of days after quote creation, you can fill in the **Quote Validity Calculation** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page.

10. When the sales quote lines are completed, choose the **Send by Email** action.
11. On the **Send Email** page, fill in any remaining fields and review the embedded sales quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).
12. If the contact accepts the quote, choose the **Make Order** action.  

    Alternatively, if your organization prefers that process, choose the **Make Invoice** action.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you added a customer in step 2, you'll be asked to confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.  
    >
    > If you added a contact from a prospective customer in step 2, you'll be asked to take the following steps:
    >
    >  - Convert the contact or prospect to a customer by choosing one of contact conversion templates. For more information, see [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  
    > - Confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.

The conversion removes the sales quote from the database. A sales invoice or a sales order is created based on the information in the sales quote so that you can process the sale. In the **Quote No.** field on the sales invoice or sales order, you can see the number of the sales quote that it was made from. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

# Manage master data synchronization

After you set up master data synchronization, when you synchronize for the first time [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

- Couples records in the selected tables.
- Creates a recurring job queue entry for each table.

The job queue entries automatically synchronize data in the subsidiary companies when someone makes a change in the source company. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> For the automatic synchronization to work, the user who makes the change in the source company must have:
>
> - A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
> - Permission sets that allow them to reschedule a background task in the subsidiary company. To learn more about the required license and permissions, go to [Before you start](admin-set-up-data-sync.md#before-you-start).
>
> Otherwise, the change happens in the next unconditional synchronization run. The unconditional synchronization is controlled by the **Inactivity Timeout Period** field on the job queue entry.

However, sometimes things go wrong, and there might be situations that you need to manage or investigate. For example, if people change the same record in both the source company and a subsidiary, synchronization fails so that you can specify the change that's correct. Or, the source company might install an extension that changes the schema of one of the tables you're synchronizing by adding a field or two. If you want to synchronize the new fields in the subsidiaries, install the same extensions and update the table schemas in their setup.

This article describes the tools you can use to keep synchronization running smoothly.

## Overwrite local changes

You can use the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on the fields and tables you synchronize to allow data from the source company to overwrite data in the subsidiary company.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable the synchronization of a field and allow the subsidiary to write values in it independently from the source company. You must either disable synchronization for the field, or allow the source company to overwrite local changes.

## Update table schemas

If the source company changes a table, for example, by adding a field that you want to synchronize, subsidiaries must update their field mappings. On the **Synchronization Fields** page, use the **Update Fields** action.

## Enable or disable couplings between records

To start or stop coupling on specific records on a table, on the **Synchronization Fields** page, choose the fields, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

## Run a full synchronization

The **Run Full Synchronization** action schedules a synchronization for all of the table records in the source company, and resynchronizes all records unconditionally. For example, resynchronization is useful if you enable an extra field on a synchronization table, or add an extra field by using the **Update Fields** action. The action retroactively synchronizes the data in those fields.

## Synchronize modified records

If you change a setting for a table or field in a subsidiary, you must update the synchronization. To update the synchronization, use the **Synchronize Modified Records** action on the **Synchronization Tables** page.

The **Synchronize Modified Records** action schedules a synchronization of the following table records:

* Records that failed to synchronize in the last attempt.
* Records that were changed in the source company after the last scheduled synchronization. You can review the last scheduled synchronization time on the **Synchronization Tables** page in the **Synchronize Changes Since** field.

The action works in the same way as a scheduled synchronization, and you can use it as a way to synchronize outside the schedule. For example, if you select the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on a field to allow data from the source company to overwrite local changes, the action updates that data. You can also just wait until the next scheduled synchronization happens.

## Investigate the status of synchronization

There are two actions on the **Synchronization Tables** page that can help you monitor your synchronization:

* **Integration Synchronization Jobs**
* **Job Queue Entries**

The following table describes the actions.

|Page  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Integration Synchronization Jobs**     | Open the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page to investigate what happened each time a job queue entry ran. To dig deeper into the details about new records that were added, or explore why a record failed to synchronize, choose the numbers in the **Inserted** or **Failed** columns. You can also use this page to clean up older records that you might not need. To learn more about cleaning up, go to [Clean up old entries](#clean-up-old-entries).        |
|**Job Queue Entries**     | Access details about the job queue entry that synchronize data for a selected table. For example, use this page to manage the status of the job queue entry,    To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you find an error on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page that you can't resolve yourself, if you contact your partner or Microsoft for support, it's helpful to provide the error message and callstack information.

## Clean up old entries

Over time, the number of entries in the synchronization log will become large, so you might want to do a little housekeeping to remove unneeded entries. To make it easier to clean up old entries, the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page offers the following actions:

* **Delete Entries Older Than 7 Days**
* **Delete All Entries**

## Adding extensions

If the source company installs a new extension, the subsidiary must also install it if they want to synchronize data for it. The subsidiary can use the **Update Fields** action On the **Synchronization Fields** page to add the tables from the extension to the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Some tables get data from related tables. If you add an extension that doesn't include related tables, the fields on those tables aren't available. Verify that you added all related tables.

<!--
## Recreate a deleted job queue entry

If the recurring job queue entry is deleted for a table, you can quickly recreate it. On the **Synchronization Tables** page, choose the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action.
-->

# Create recurring purchase lines

If you often need to create purchase lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.

## Set up recurring purchase lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter the information in the fields that reflect the standard lines you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring purchase lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual purchase documents after you insert the recurring purchase lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring purchase lines to a vendor

Assign one or more recurring purchase lines to a vendor so that they're available to insert on purchase documents from that vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant vendor.
3. Choose the **Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, select codes for the recurring purchase lines that you want to be able to insert on purchase documents for the vendor.
5. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring purchase lines are to be used.
6. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on each document type, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring purchase line that exists for the vendor.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring purchase line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Purchase Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a vendor card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring purchase lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring purchase lines on a purchase invoice

If recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you can insert them, or have them automatically added, on all types of purchase documents, such as a purchase invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring purchase lines to vendors, you'll be informed if recurring purchase lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to insert one or more standard purchase lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard purchase lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard purchase lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

# Fulfilling Service Contracts 
One way to set up a service management business is to have standard contractual agreements between you and your customers that describe the level of service and the service expectations. You can create contract templates that include necessary information, such as customer, start date of contract, and invoice period.  
  
After you set up the template, you can customize the resulting contract to keep track of service hours, or other items that may vary from customer to customer. You can also set up a contract manually from a service contract quote. Finally, you can adjust your service pricing to keep track of discounts that a specific customer qualifies for, by specifying the discount amount on the **Service Contract** page.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Dispose of or retire fixed assets

When you sell or otherwise dispose of a fixed asset, you must post the disposal value to calculate and record the gain or loss. A disposal entry must be the last entry posted for a fixed asset. For partially disposed fixed assets, you can post more than one disposal entry. The total of all posted disposal amounts must be a credit amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you trade-in a fixed asset for another one, you must record both the sale of the old asset (disposal) and the purchase of the new one (acquisition). For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

The following steps assume that your posting groups are set up on the **FA Posting Groups** page. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  

## To post a disposal from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Disposal**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for disposal posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Disposal Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Disposal Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

If you sell or dispose of part of a fixed asset, you must split up the asset before you can record the disposal transaction. For more information, see [Transfer, Split, or Combine Fixed Assets](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md).  

## To view disposal ledger entries

When you sell or dispose of a fixed asset, the disposal value is posted to the general ledger where you can view the result.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.  
3. Select the depreciation book that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
4. Select a line with **Disposal** in the **FA Posting Category** field, and then choose the **Find Entries** action.  
5. On the **Find Entries** page, select the general ledger entry line, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.  

The **General Ledger Entries** page opens where you can see the entries that the disposal posting resulted in.

# Enable Approval Workflows

When you've created an approval workflow and you're sure it's good to go, you must enable it.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Enable a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the workflow that you want to enable.  
3. On the **Workflow** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

# Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you cannot change a costing method for an item after you have included the item in a transaction. For example, after you have bought or sold the item. If an incorrect costing method was assigned to the item or items, you might not discover the issue until you do your financial reporting.

This topic describes how to resolve this situation. The recommended approach is to replace the item that has the incorrect costing method with a new item, and use an assembly order to transfer the inventory from the old item to the new.

> [!NOTE]
> Using assembly orders allows the costs to still flow although there are outstanding purchase invoices or shipping charges to post. Additionally, it allows you to undo the conversion and get the quantities of the original items back, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> To become familiar with the process, we recommend that you start the conversion process with a single item or a small set of items.

## About Costing Methods

Costing methods control cost calculations when goods are purchased, received in inventory, and sold. Costing methods affect the timing of amounts recorded in COGS that affect gross profit. It is this flow that calculates COGS. The cost of goods sold (COGS) and revenue are used to determine gross profit, as follows:

*gross profit* = *revenue - COGS*

When you set up inventory items, you must assign a costing method. The method can vary from business to business, and from item to item, so it's important to choose the right one. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following costing methods:

* Average
* FIFO
* LIFO
* Standard
* Specific

For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

## Use Assembly Orders to Change Costing Method Assignments

This section describes the following steps for changing the costing method assigned to an item:

1. Define a default costing method.
2. Identify the items that to change the costing method for and renumber them.
3. Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch.
4. Manually copy related master data from the existing item to the new item.
5. Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item.
6. Transfer the inventory to the new item.
7. Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand.
8. Block the original item from further use.  

### Define a default costing method

To help avoid future mistakes you can specify a default costing method for new items. Whenever someone creates a new item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest the default costing method. You specify the default method in the **Default Costing Method** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. 

### Identify the items to change the costing method for and renumber them

You may want to give your new items the same numbers as those they are replacing. To do that, change the numbers of the existing items. For example, if the existing item number is "P1000," you might change it to "X-P1000." This is a manual change that you must make for each item.

### Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch

Create the new items using the current number scheme. With the exception of the **Costing Method** field, the new items should contain the same master data as the existing items. To transfer the master data for the item, and related data from other features, use the **Copy Item** action on the **Item Card** page. For more information, see [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).

After you create the new items and transfer the master data, assign the correct costing method.

### Manually copy related master data from the original item to the new item

To make the new items fully useful you must manually copy some master data from other areas, as described in the following table.

|Area  |What to copy  |How to copy it  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Inventory |Stock-keeping units (SKUs) |Check whether a SKU is specified for the original item. If planning parameters have been entered for each SKU card, then you must manually create the SKU for the new item. If the parameters are not specified, you can use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job from the **Item Card** page to create the data.|
| |Item substitutions |Check whether any item substitutions are defined for the original item. If there are, transfer that data to the new item. To view substitute items, use the **Substitutions** action on the **Item Card** page. |
| |Analysis reports |Review the Item Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Purchase Analysis reports. For those that reference the original items you can either create a new analysis report with a reference to the new item (keeping the original analysis report to use as history) or adjust the reports so that they reference the new item. |
| |Standard journals |Check whether standard journals reference the original item and transfer that data to the new item when necessary. This information is found on the standard journals, which are available on the item journal.  |
|Sales |Sales prepayment percentage | Check whether any sales prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Sales**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**.|
|Purchase |Purchase prepayment percentage |Check whether any purchase prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Purchases**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**. |
|Warehouse |Bin contents |Review the bin content defined for the original item. If columns such as as Min. Qty., Max. Qty., Default, and Dedicated have been individually entered then you must manually create bin content for the new item. If they are not, no action is required. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will maintain the records when you register warehouse documents and journals.|
|Job |Job Prices |Check whether project prices are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. This information is available on the **Project Card** page in the **Project Details – No. of Prices** part on the **FactBox pane**. |
|Service |Service resource skill |Check whether service resource skills are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view resource skills, use the **Resource Skills** action on the **Item Card** page.  |
| |Service item components |Check whether components are defined for the original service item and transfer that data to the new item. To view service item components, on the **Item Card** page use the **Service Item** action to open the list of related service items, and then choose the **Components** action.  |
|Production |Production BOMs |Check whether any production BOMs contain the original item and replace it with the new item. To replace the original item, on the **Production BOMs** page, choose the **Exchange Production BOM Item** action. |
|Assembly |Assembly BOMs |Check whether any assembly BOMs contain the original item and manually replace it with the new item. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the new costing method is Standard you should enter a value in the **Standard Cost** field on the **Item Card** page. You can use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to set the cost shares accordingly. For more information, see [Update Standard Costs](finance-how-to-update-standard-costs.md).

### Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item

> [!NOTE]
> This step does not consider quantities that are included in unshipped orders. For more information, see [Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md#handle-inventory-quantities-that-are-allocated-to-demand). 

Use a physical inventory journal to produce a list of the quantities in inventory. Depending on the warehouse location setup, use one of the following:

* Physical Invt. Journals
* Whse. Phys. Invt. Journals

Both journals can calculate the inventory quantity of the item, including the location, variant, bin, and storage location. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

### Transfer the inventory to the new item

Create and post assembly orders to transfer the cost and inventory quantity from the original item to the new item. Assembly orders can convert one item to another while preserving the costs. This helps ensure that the net totals for the inventory account and COGS are not affected (except when the new costing method is Standard, in which case costs may be distributed to variance accounts). For more information, see [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

When creating assembly orders, use the information from the Physical Invt. journal or Whse. Phys. Invt. journal. The following tables describe the information in the reports to enter in the header and lines on the assembly order.

#### Header

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Item No. |The number of the new item. |
|Quantity |The quantity in physical inventory journal.<br> **NOTE:** The quantities calculated by the physical inventory journals does not include the quantities that are on orders that have not yet shipped.  |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal.  |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Bin Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

#### Lines

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Type |Item |
|No. |The number of the original item. |
|Quantity per |1 |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

> [!NOTE]
> An assembly order can handle only one SKU of an item at a time. You must create an assembly order for each combination of SKU that has a quantity in inventory.

> [!NOTE]
> For a warehouse location, you might have to create picks before you can post the assembly order. To investigate that, review the setup for picking on the **Location Card** page. For more information, see [Set Up Items and Locations for Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-how-to-set-up-items-for-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).

### Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand

Ideally, the inventory for the original item should go to zero after you transfer the inventory quantities. However, there can be outstanding orders, worksheets, and journals (see the table below) that still require a quantity of the original item. The quantity could also be blocked by a reservation or item tracking.

**Example**
There are 1000 pcs. in inventory, and 20 pcs. are reserved for a sales order that has not yet shipped. In that case, you might decide to keep the 20 pcs. in the old item so that you can fulfill the outstanding order.

> [!NOTE]
> There are functional areas that can affect the quantity, as listed in the table below, so it can be tricky to find the correct amount. To be safe, using the example above, you can choose to keep 100 pcs. and transfer the remaining 900 pcs. instead. Another way to do it would be to process the documents and journals so that only a manageable few remain. Yet another alternative is to transfer the entire quantity to the new item and then transfer some of it back to the original item using the assembly order.

The following table lists functional areas where there might be outstanding quantities.

|Area  |Where to look for outstanding quantities  |
|---------|---------|
|Sales |Sales documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Inventory |Item journals, reservations, item tracking, and standard cost worksheet |
|Purchase |Purchase documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Planning |Requisition worksheet, planning worksheet, and order planning |
|Warehouse |Transfer orders, warehouse shipments, warehouse journals, and warehouse picks, put-aways, and movements, internal picks and put-aways, and bin creation worksheets |
|Assembly |Assembly documents, including orders, return orders, and blanket orders |
|Jobs |project planning lines and project journal lines |
|Service |Service documents and service contracts |
|Production |Production orders (planned, firm planned, and released) |

### Block the original item from further use

When the inventory for the original item is zero, you can block the item to prevent it fom being used in new transactions. To block the item, on the **Item Card** page, turn on the **Blocked** toggle. For more information, see [Block Items from Sales or Purchasing](inventory-how-block-items.md).

## Summary

Changing the costing method on items that have been used in transactions is a process, and not a standard action in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use the steps described in this topic as a template for the process.

The process can be time consuming because there are several manual steps. However, taking the time to complete it will minimize the impact of mistakes on your general ledger.

We recommend the following:

1. Assess the feasibility of the process by taking one, or maybe a few, representative items through the entire process.
2. Consider contacting an experienced partner who can help you with the process.

# Design details: average cost

The average cost of an item is calculated with a periodic weighted average. The average is based on the average cost period you have specified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The valuation date is set automatically.  

## Setting up average cost calculation

The following table describes the two fields on the **Inventory Setup** page that must be filled to enable average cost calculation.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Average Cost Period**|Specifies which period the average cost is calculated in. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Day**<br />- **Week**<br />- **Month**<br />- **Accounting Period**<br /><br /> Inventory decreases that are posted in the average cost period get the average cost calculated for that period.|  
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Specifies how the average cost is calculated. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Item**<br />- **Item, Variant, and Location**<br /> With this option, the average cost is calculated for each item, for each location, and for each variant of the item. The average cost of this item depends on where you store it and the variant you select, such as color.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use one average cost period and one average cost calculation type in a fiscal year.  
>
> The **Accounting Periods** page shows which average cost period and which average cost calculation type is in effect during that period, for each accounting period.  

## Calculating average cost

 When you post a transaction for an item that uses the Average costing method, an entry is created in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table. This entry contains the transaction’s item number, variant code, and location code. The entry also contains the **Valuation Date** field, which specifies the last date of the average cost period in which the transaction was posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This field should not be confused with the **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table, which shows the date when the value takes effect and is used to determine the average cost period in which the value entry belongs.  

 The average cost of a transaction is calculated when the item’s cost is adjusted. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md). A cost adjustment uses the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table to identify which items (or items, locations, and variants) to calculate average costs for. For each entry with a cost that hasn't been adjusted, the cost adjustment uses the following to determine the average cost:  

- Determines the cost of the item at the start of the average cost period.  
- Adds the sum of the inbound costs that were posted during the average cost period. These include purchases, sales returns, positive adjustments, and production and assembly outputs.  
- Subtracts the sum of the costs of any outbound transactions that were fixed-applied to receipts in the average cost period. These typically include purchase returns and negative outputs.  
- Divides by the total inventory quantity for the end of the average cost period. Excludes inventory decreases that are being valued.  

 The calculated average cost is then applied to the inventory decreases for the item (or item, location, and variant) with posting dates in the average cost period. For inventory increases that are fixed-applied to inventory decreases in the average cost period, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] forwards the calculated average cost from the increase to the decrease.  

### Example: average cost period = day

The following example shows the effect of calculating average cost based on an average cost period of one day. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page is set to **Item**.  

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not yet occurred, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

 The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-02-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-03-23 |   No |

 The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per day is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

### Example: average cost period = month

 This example shows the effect of calculating the average cost based on an average cost period of one month. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page  is set to **Item**.  

 If the average cost period is one month, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates one entry for each combination of item number, variant code, location code, and valuation date.  

 The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> Because cost adjustment has not occurred yet, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-31-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-28-23 |   No |

> [!NOTE]  
> The valuation date is set to the last day in the average cost period, which in this case is the last day of the month.  

The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per month is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

|**Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 | Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 6 |

The average cost of entry number 3 is calculated in the average cost period for January. The average cost for entries 4 and 6 is calculated in the average cost period for February.  

To get the average cost for February, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the average cost of the item received in inventory (100.00) to the average cost at the beginning of the period (30.00). The sum (130.00) is then divided by the total quantity in inventory (2). This calculation gives the resulting average cost of the item in the February period (65.00). The average cost is assigned to the inventory decreases in the period (entries 4 and 6).  

## Setting the valuation date

 The **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table determines the average cost period in which an inventory decrease entry belongs. This setting also applies to work in process (WIP) inventory.  

 The following table shows the criteria that are used to set the valuation date.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Valued Quantity | Revaluation | Valuation Date |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 |  | Positive | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 2 | Later than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Negative | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 3 | Earlier than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Positive | No | Latest valuation date of the applied value entries |
| 4 |  | Negative | Yes | Posting date of the revaluation value entry |

### Example

The following table of value entries illustrates the different scenarios.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Item Ledger Entry Type | Valuation Date | Valued Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry No. | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 01-01-20 | Purchase | 01-01-20 | 2 | 20.00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 01-15-20 | (Item Charge) | 01-01-20 | 2 | 8.00 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 02-01-20 | -1 | -14.00 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 03-01-20 | (Revaluation) | 03-01-20 | 1 | -.4.00 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 03-01-20 | -1 | -10.00 | 3 | 5 |

> [!NOTE]  
> In entry number 5 in the preceding table, the user has entered a sales order with a posting date (02-01-20) that comes before the latest valuation date of applied value entries (03-01-20). If the corresponding value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for this date (02-01-20) were used for this entry, then it would be 14.00. This would give a situation where the quantity on inventory is zero, but the inventory value is –4.00.  
>
> To avoid such a quantity-value mismatch, the valuation date is set to equal the latest valuation date of the applied value entries (03-01-20). The value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field becomes 10.00 (after revaluation), which means that the quantity on inventory is zero, and the inventory value is also zero.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Because the **Inventory Valuation** report is based on posting date, the report will reflect any quantity-value mismatches in scenarios as in the above example. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Valuation](design-details-inventory-valuation.md).  

If the quantity on inventory is less than zero after you post the inventory decrease, the valuation date is set to the posting date of the inventory decrease. You can change this date when the inventory increase is applied, according to the rules described in the note earlier in this section.  

## Recalculating average cost

Valuing inventory decreases as a weighted average would be straightforward in several scenarios:

- Purchases are always invoiced before sales.
- Postings are never backdated.
- You never made mistakes.

However, the reality is different.  

As the examples in this article illustrate, the valuation date is defined as the date from which the value entry is included in the average cost calculation. This setting lets you do several things for items with the Average costing method:  

- Invoice the sale of an item before you invoice its purchase.  
- Backdate a posting.  
- Recover an incorrect posting.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Another reason for this flexibility is fixed application. For more information about fixed application, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

Because of this flexibility, you might have to recalculate the average cost after posting. For example, if you post an inventory increase or decrease with a valuation date that's before an inventory decrease. The recalculation of the average cost occurs automatically when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, manually or automatically.  

You can change the inventory valuation base within an accounting period by changing the values in the **Average Cost Period** and **Average Cost Calc. Type** fields. However, we recommend that you use caution and consult your auditor.  

### Example of recalculated average cost

This example shows how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the average cost when you post on a date that's before an inventory decrease. The example is based on an average cost period of **Day**.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item before the posting is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 4 |

The user posts an inventory increase (entry number 5) with a valuation date (01-03-20) that's before an inventory decrease. To balance the inventory, the average cost must be recalculated and adjusted to 17.00.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item after entry number 5 is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 01-03-20 | 1 | 21.00 | 5 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 4 |

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Finance Administrators

Finance administrators use the report to identify overdue invoices and prioritize collection efforts. By reviewing the aging buckets, you can focus on customers with significant outstanding balances that don't align with payment terms. Expanding the report matrix can help you identify specific invoices that are past due and need action.

# Handling Lot Sizes in Production
In terms of quantity, the number of items you produce in a production operation might not correlate to how sell them. For example, you might produce hundreds of items in a single lot, but sell each item individually. When you configure your production routes and bills of materials (BOMs), there are few nuances you should consider with regards to lot sizes. This topic describes how lot sizes impact cost calculations and resource planning.

## Units of Measure in Production Bill of Materials
Although you specify the base unit of measure (UOM) for an item, your BOM might use a different UOM for the finished product. For example, the base UOM for an item might be PCS, but your BOM might call for pallet or ton. This comes in handy when your machines or raw components dictate the volume. For example, you probably wouldn't want to bake a single muffin because it is difficult to use a portion of an egg. Instead, you bake a batch of muffins to reduce waste. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## Lot size on routing lines
From a routing perspective, you can specify a lot size on routing lines to align with the capacity of the machines that produce the items. The run time on routing lines is reduced proportionally to the lot size. 

This works well when the quantity on a production order is a factor of the lot size on the route. For example, if your baking sheet can hold 10 muffins, you should bake 10, 20, 30, and so on, and not 5 nor 15.  This is much less of an issue if you are dealing with large quantities.

Lot size is also popular in manufacturing environments where output is measured as quantity you can make during fixed amount of time. Example, if Volume per 9 hour shift is 25000 cubic feet, you can set run time as 9 hours and lot size as 25000.
The production order quantity becomes less important as on the production order the run time gets calculated as the Run time / Lot size to get the run time per piece.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The value defined in Lot size doesn't have impact on time specified in **Setup Time** field of the routing line. The setup will happen only one time, even if there are several lots. For example, so that you don’t need to warm the oven for the second lot of muffins. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).

## Lot Sizes for Items and Stockkeeping Units
Lot sizes defined for routings are not the same as lot sizes for items or stockkeeping units. Those values are used for a different purpose, and do not affect production capacity. 

## Lot size on item and stockkeeping units
For items and stockkeeping units, lot sizes have the following effects on cost calculation and supply planning:

* For standard cost calculation, if you enable **Cost Incl Setup** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the cost for the setup is added to the standard cost. If you specify a lot size, the setup cost for routing operation will be reduced according to one lot size. For example, if your lot size defined on item card is 10, and it takes 15 minutes to heat the oven, the cost of the fuel will be allocated to the 10 muffins as roughly 1.5 minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Setup costs are handled differently from a standard cost and capacity allocation perspectives. If produced quantity doesn't match lot size defined in the item card that will lead to variation. For more information, see [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md). <!--not sure that I got this part right seems to repeat the first example.-->

For supply planning, the lot size setting on items works with the **Default Dampener %** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore changes in demand that are below the dampener percentage and will not create planning suggestions. For example, 15 is specified in the Default Dampener % field, and we have a production order for 20 muffins to feed 20 guests, but one guest cannot attend. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore the single missing guest because it's only 10% of the lot size 10 defined on the item. However, if two guests cannot make it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that we reduce the order quantity because two is 20% of the lot size. For more information about planning, see [Planning](production-planning.md).

# Process sales return orders  

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

## Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Sales Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted sales invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to return that quantity on a new sales return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    -   For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    -   For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    -   Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    -   If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
     >   
     >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted sales credit memo line for a new sales credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Sales Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **post** action.

## To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
You might decide to compensate a customer for an item that you have sold them by replacing the item. You can make a replacement with the same item or a different item. This situation could occur if you mistakenly shipped the wrong item to the customer, for example.  

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.
3. On the **Move Negative Sales Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line for the replacement item is deleted from the sales return order and inserted in a new **Sales Order** page. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To create return-related documents from a sales return order
You can have replacement sales orders, purchase return orders, and replacement purchase orders created automatically during the sales return process. This is useful, for example, in situations where you want to handle items with warranties provided by vendors.

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, choose the **Create Return-Related Documents** action.
2. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the number of a vendor if you want to create vendor documents automatically.
3. If a returned item must be returned to the vendor, select the **Create Purch. Ret. Order** check box.
4. If a returned item must be ordered from the vendor, select the **Create Purchase Order** check box.
5. If a replacement sales order must be created, select the **Create Sales Order** check box.

## To create a restock charge
You might decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item. This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them, for example.

You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes this for a sales return order, but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo.

1. Open the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process.
2. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
3. Fill in the fields as for any item charge line. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).  

When you post the sales return order, the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

# Manage Project Budgets

You can set up a budget for each project. The budget is used to plan the resources that you allocate to a project. The budget can be either general with few entries or it can contain more entries that are divided into activity levels. You can then compare the budgeted amounts with the actual usage as recorded in the project journal. By monitoring differences between actual usage and budgeted usage, you can control an ongoing project and improve the quality of future projects by reducing the risk of underestimating costs.

The following procedure describes how to estimate budgeted costs during planning. For information about recording budgeted versus actual project prices and costs, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).  

## <a name="JobBudgetCosts"></a> To estimate the budgeted costs for a project

When a customer wants to know the price of a project that will be invoiced based on usage, you must determine the budgeted costs for the project. Use the **Project Task Lines** page to do that.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a task line of type Posting, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
4. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For the **Line Type** field, refer to the following information.  

| Line Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |The cost and price amounts entered on the planning line are the budgeted costs for the particular planning line. The price amount will be invoiced. |
| **Budget** |The customer is not charged for usage. Usage isn't transferred to an invoice, but is used to calculate WIP. |
| **Billable** |The customer is charged for usage. Usage is transferred to the invoice, based on the quantity specified in the **Qty. to Transfer to Invoice** field. |

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Planned Delivery Date** field for the planning line contains the date when usage related to the planning line is expected to be completed. It is also the date when the planning line may be transferred to a sales invoice and posted. <br /><br /> On the underlying project task on the **Project Card** page, the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields respectively contain the value of the **Planned Delivery Date** field on the earliest and latest project planning lines in the related **Project Planning Lines** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you fill in the **Quantity** field, all total price and total cost information will be calculated and filled in for that planning line. You can edit them at any time.

On the **Project Card** page, you can now see a summary of the total budgeted costs, budgeted price, billable cost and billable price for each task.

For information about recording budgeted versus actual project prices and costs, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

# Sales Quick Start

To be able to sell products and services, you must first set up items and customers. Once that is done, you can start registering sales orders and sending out invoices.

## Set up items to sell

This video shows how to set up an item to sell in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

### Set up a new item

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up items, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

## Set up customers

This video shows how to set up a new customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<br>

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

### Set up a new customer

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up customers, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md)

## Create a sales order  

When you sell something to a customer, you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a sales invoice. However, if your sales process is more complex, for example if you have situations where you only ship parts of an order quantity, you use a sales order.

### To create a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product.

9. To add a comment about the order line that the customer can see on the printed sales order, write a comment in the **Description** field on an empty line.

10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item that you want to sell to the customer.

11. To only ship a part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value is copied to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

12. To only invoice a part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

13. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales orders, see [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## Create a sales invoice

When you create and post a sales invoice, you not only create the invoice document you send to the customer, you also create the related quantity and value entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### To create and post a sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 20.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select **New** to create a new entry.

3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.  

8. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

9. Repeat steps 5 through 8 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.  

10. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

11. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales invoices, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md)

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|
| **Project Costs Applied Account** |A balancing account to the WIP Costs Account, which is a contra for a negative expense account. Used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project*. | Applied Costs, Recognized Costs|
| **Item Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Resource Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **G/L Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Project Costs Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Accrued Costs account, which is an expense account. | Accrued Costs|
| **G/L Expense Acc. (Budget)** |The sales account that will be used for general ledger expenses in project tasks with this posting group. If left empty, the general ledger account entered on the project planning line is used. | |
| **WIP Accrued Sales Account** |The WIP account for the calculated sales value of the WIP, which is an accrued revenue account for your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the recognized revenue, you post to this account. | Accrued Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** |The account for the invoiced sales value of the WIP that is not able to be recognized. It is a balance sheet Unearned Revenue account. | Recognized Sales, Applied Sales|
| **Project Sales Applied Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Invoiced Sales account, which is a contra income account. | Applied Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **Project Sales Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Project Sales Account, which is an income account. | Accrued Sales|
| **Recognized Costs Account** |The expense account that contains the recognized costs for the project. It is a debit expense account ordinarily. | Recognized Costs|
| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods.

To analyze budgeted amounts, you must first create general ledger (G/L) budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## View a G/L budget

In a budget with dimensions, you can filter the entries and see specific budgets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **G/L Budgets** page, open the budget you want to view.  
3. At the top of the page, fill in the fields necessary to define what is shown. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then you must fill in the **View by** field. If you have not selected **Period** in either of those fields, enter the appropriate period in the **Date Filter** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only entries from the general ledger budget with the filter codes you enter on the **Filters** FastTab are included in the calculation. Budget entries without any or with other filter codes are not included. As long as the filter remains on the page, the budget only displays entries with those filter codes.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Edit Budget** action to modify the budget. On the budget page, choose an amount to view the underlying general ledger budget entries.

## View actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts

You can view general ledger budgets and compare them with actual figures in several areas of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. Hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

> [!NOTE]  
> The filters you set on the page header will be applied to both general ledger and budget entries.

The leftmost columns contain the chart of accounts. Of the five columns on the rightmost side, the first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **View by** field on the **G/L Balance/Budget** page to select the period length. Use the **View as** field to select the way the amounts will be calculated, either **Net Change** or **Balance at Date**. Choose the **Previous Period** or **Next Period** action to change the period.  

## To view actual and budgeted amounts for several periods  

Instead of viewing the actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts within a single period, you can view a number of periods for a single account.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant general ledger account, then choose the **G/L Account Balance/Budget** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

# Managing Database Access Intent

As a super user or administrator, you can change the database access intent on reports, pages of the type API, and queries to improve performance of the service.

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set up to use read-only replicas of the primary (read-write) database. Using the database replica reduces the load on the primary database. In some cases, it will also improve the performance when viewing data in the client. Replicas are beneficial for objects, like reports, queries, and API pages, that are used for viewing data only, not modifying data.

When objects run, the database access intent determines whether to use a read-only replica, if one is available, or the primary database. Reports, API pages, and queries are developed with a predefined database access intent (see [DatabaseAccessIntent property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataaccessintent-property)).

The **Database Access Intent List** page lets you override the predefined database access intent for objects when they're run.

In database terms, this feature is commonly known as *read scale-out*. For more information about read-scale out and data access intent in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Utilizing Read Scale-Out for Better Performance](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and Administration help.

## To change the database access intent

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Database Access Intent List**, and then choose the related link.

    The page lists all reports, pages, and queries. The **Access Intent** column includes one of the following values:

    |**Setting**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |**Default**|Indicates that the object uses the predefined database access intent.|
    |**Allow Write**|Sets the object to use the primary database, allowing the user to modify data.|
    |**Read Only**|Sets the object to use the database replica, which means that the user can only view data, not change data.|

2. Choose the **Edit List** action.

3. On the **Edit - Database Access Intent List** page, change the **Access Intent** field for the objects.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an object that is editable, like the Customer Card, is set to **Read Only**, the primary database will still be used, regardless of the access intent, allowing users to make changes as normal.

title: Data ownership models for synchronization
description: Companies are both a legal and business constructs, and they are used to secure and visualize business data.
author: brentholtorf

# Data ownership models for synchronization

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires that you specify an owner for the data you store. For more information, see [Types of tables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) in the Power Apps documentation. When you set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must choose the **User or team** ownership for records that are synchronized. Actions that can be performed on these records can be controlled on a user level. <!--We recommend the Team ownership model because it makes it easier to manage ownership for multiple people.NO LONGER TRUE IN DATAVERSE-->

## Team Ownership
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a company is a legal and business table that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit table, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To make synchronization possible, when you enable synchronization for a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following happens in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* We create a company table that is equivalent to the company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The name of the company is suffixed with "BC Company ID." For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create a default business unit that has the same name as the company. For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create separate owner team with the same name as the company and associate it with the business unit. The name of the team is prefixed with "BCI -." For example, BCI - Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* Records that are created and synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are assigned to the "BCI Owner" team that is linked to the business unit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you rename a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the names of the company, business, and team that we create automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are not updated. Because only the company ID is used for integration, this does not affect synchronization. If you want the names to match you must update the company, business unit, and team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

![The root business unit is on top, the teams are in the center, and then the companies are at the bottom.](media/cds_bu_team_company.png)

In this configuration, records that are related to the Cronus US company will be owned by a team that is linked to the Cronus US business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unit–level visibility in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The Sales Manager role is assigned to members of the Cronus US Sales team.
* Users who have the Sales Manager role can access account records for members of the same business unit.
* The Cronus US Sales team is linked to the Cronus US business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the Cronus US Sales team can see any account that is owned by the Cronus US user, which would have come from the Cronus US company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new EUR (Europe) root business unit is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both Cronus DE (Gernamy) and Cronus ES (Spain). The EUR business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the EUR Sales team access to account data in both Cronus DE and Cronus ES by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI row. When a BCI record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an table, administrators can change the owning team, but a team must always be assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Records become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.

## Choosing a different business unit
You can change the business unit selection if you are using the Teams ownership model. If you use the Person ownership model, the default business unit is always selected. 

If you choose another business unit, for example, one that you created earlier in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], it will keep its original name. That is, it will not be suffixed with the company ID. We will create a team that does use the naming convention.

When changing a business unit, you can choose only the business units that are one level below the root business unit.

## Person Ownership
If you choose the Person ownership model you must specify each salesperson who will own new records. The business unit and team are created as described in the [Team Ownership](admin-cds-company-concept.md#team-ownership) section.

The default business unit is used when the Person ownership model is chosen, and you cannot choose another business unit. The team that is associated with the default business unit will own records for common tables, such as the Product table, that are not related to specific salespersons.

When you couple salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will add the user to the default team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. You can verify that users are added by looking at the **Default Team Member** column on the **Users - Common Data Service** page. If the user is not added, you can add them manually by using the **Add Coupled Users to Team** action. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in Business Central with Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

# Record and reimburse employees' expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employees in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization might have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is flexible enough to suit many different practices. The exact account numbers to use depend on your organization's configuration and processes.  

You can use general journals for employee accounts to register employee expenses and reimbursement transactions in foreign currencies, and then easily track the amounts and compare them to receipts. Leave your calculator in your desk drawer—Business Central can adjust the exchange rate for you. When you use general journals to post transactions for employee accounts, such as when you reimburse expenses, you can use the **Currency Code** field to specify the currency for the transactions. Specifying a currency lets you use the same features as when you register transactions in the customer and vendor ledgers. For example, employees can register an expense in euros but get paid in dollars.

To ensure that the exchange rate for the amounts is up to date, you can adjust employee balances when you run the currency exchange rate batch job. If you want to use the exchange rate table, but settle employee balances in your local currency, you can exclude employee accounts when you adjust exchange rates.

## To record an employee's expense

You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee

You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries

You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).

# Remove and reapply item ledger entries
On the **Application Worksheet** page, you can view and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.  

When you post a transaction where items are moved in or out of inventory, an item application is created between each inventory increase and inventory decrease. These applications determine the flow of costs from the goods that are received in inventory to the cost of goods going out of inventory. Because of the way the unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and a skewed unit cost. For more information, see Design Details: Item Application.

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries:

- You have forgotten to make a fixed application.
- You have made an incorrect fixed application.
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied.

If possible, use a document to reapply an item ledger entry. For example, if you must make a purchase return of an item to which a sale has already been applied, you can reapply by creating and posting the purchase return document by using the correct application in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return line. You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function or the **Copy from Document** function in the purchase return document to make this easier. When you post the document, the item ledger entry is automatically reapplied. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

If you can't use a document to reapply, such as when you have to correct a fixed application, then use the **Application Worksheet** page to correct an application.

> [!Warning]  
> The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet:
    - You should not leave application entries unapplied for long periods of time because other users cannot process the items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. Users who try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry receive the following error message: “You cannot perform this action because entries for item XXX are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user XXX.”
    - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items.
    - When you close the application worksheet, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performs a check to make sure that all entries are applied. For example, if you remove a quantity application but do not create a new application, and then you close the application worksheet, a new application is created. This helps keep the cost intact. However, if you remove a fixed application, a new fixed application is not automatically created when you close the worksheet. You must do this manually by creating a new application in the worksheet.
    - It is possible to remove applications from more than one entry at a time in the application worksheet. However, because applying entries affects the set of entries that are available for application, you cannot create an application for more than one entry at a time.
    - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation: If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply, the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information.

## To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  Enter filters on the **General** FastTab to make it easier to find the item ledger entry for which you want to change the application.  
4.  Select the item ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page opens to show the item ledger entry or entries that are currently applied to the selected entry.  
5.  Select the item ledger entry for which you want to remove the application.  
6.  Choose the **Remove Application** action. This removes the item application entry that links the two item ledger entries and moves it to the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  
7.  Close the **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page.  

 The **Remaining Quantity** field of the two item ledger entries is increased by the quantity that has been unapplied. The removed item ledger entry is now available for reapplication on the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not leave application entries unapplied for longer periods of time because other users cannot process the affected items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. The following error message is displayed if you try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry:  
>   
>  **You cannot perform this action because entries for item \<item\> are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user \<user\>.**  

## To reapply an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  To reapply entries that were removed since the worksheet was opened, select the item ledger entry that you want to reapply, and then choose the **Reapply** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This reapplication to the original balance also occurs automatically when you close the **Application Worksheet** page.  
4.  To apply an available open item ledger entry to another entry, select the item ledger entry that you want to apply. Choose the **Unapplied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page opens.  
5.  Select one or more item ledger entries that you want to apply to the entry selected on the **Application Worksheet** page, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     An item application entry is created between the two item ledger entries. The **Remaining Quantity** fields of the two entries are reduced by the applied quantity.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have chosen to make an application that would create an infinite loop in the cost adjustment process, then the application that you proposed is not made. This can occur when the original entries created negative stock. The application is not made. Therefore, you must select a different entry for the application.  
6.  If the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field in the **Inventory Setup** is set to **Always**, then the cost adjustment batch job is automatically run after you make a reapplication. Otherwise, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to make sure that all costs are up to date.

# Reconcile bank accounts

Bank reconciliation helps ensure that what's in your books matches the statements you receive from your bank. Bank account reconciliation compares and matches entries in the bank accounts you set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bank transactions at your bank. Reconciliation can then post the balances to your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to make them available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover missing payments and resolve bookkeeping errors.

This article describes how to reconcile bank accounts from the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

However, you can also reconcile bank accounts on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page when you process payments. Open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries close when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. This action automatically reconciles the bank account for the payments that you post with the journal. Learn more in [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The North American versions offers the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but doesn't let you import bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, clear the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Learn more in [Reconciling Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

The lines on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page are divided into two panes. The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows either imported bank transactions or ledger entries with outstanding payments. The **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane shows the ledger entries in the internal bank account.

## About bank reconciliation

Reconciling transactions in statements from your bank with bank entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is referred to as *matching*. There are three ways to match transactions with bank entries:

* Automatically, by using the **Match Automatically** action.
* Automatically, by using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action.

  This action is available as part of the bank reconciliation assist (preview) feature, which an AI-powered feature. Learn more in [Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot](bank-reconciliation-with-copilot.md).
* Manually, by selecting lines in both panes to link each bank statement line to one or more bank account ledger entries, and then using the **Match Manually** action.

The **Applied** checkbox is selected on lines where entries match. Learn more in [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md). If you enter a statement ending date on the bank reconciliation after you match its lines with entries, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will undo the matches for lines and entries that are after that date.

> [!NOTE]
> After you enter a date in the **Statement Date** field, the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page filters the bank ledger entries to show only entries up to that date. You can only post bank reconciliations with bank ledger entries on or before the statement ending date. The filter ensures that your bank ledger is balanced with your bank statement on the statement ending date, with the difference being the outstanding payments and checks.

When the value in the **Total Balance** field in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane equals the total value of the **Balance To Reconcile** field plus the **Balance Last Statement** field in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, you can choose the **Post** action. Unmatched bank account ledger entries remain on the page, indicating discrepancies that you should resolve to reconcile the bank account.

Any lines that can't be matched, indicated by a value in the **Difference** field, will remain on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. They represent some kind of discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

You can fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page in the following ways:

* Automatically, by using the **Import Bank Statement** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane with bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.
* Manually, by using the **Suggest Lines** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.

## Add bank statement lines by importing a bank statement

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.

To import bank statements as bank feeds, you must set up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service. The setup includes linking your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank accounts. Learn more in [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Bank Account No.** field, select the relevant bank account. The bank account ledger entries that exist on the bank account appear in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
4. In the **Statement Date** field, enter the date of the statement from the bank.
5. In the **Statement Ending Balance** field, enter the balance of the statement from the bank.
6. If you have a bank statement file, choose the **Import Bank Statement** action.
7. Locate the file, and then choose the **Open** button to import the bank transactions into the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

## To fill in bank reconciliation lines with the Suggest Lines action

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane is filled in according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the earliest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the latest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Typically, the ending date will match the date specified in the **Statement Date** field. However, if you want to reconcile transactions for only part of a period, you can enter a different ending date.

4. If you don't want the bank account ledger entries to include unmatched open reversed entries, choose the **Exclude Reversed Entries** toggle. By default, the list of bank account ledger entries include reversed entries up to the statement date.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries automatically

The **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page offers automatic matching functionality based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (left pane) with text on one or more bank account ledger entries (right pane). You can overwrite the suggested automatic matching, and you can choose to not use automatic matching at all. Learn more in [Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually](#match-bank-statement-lines-with-bank-account-ledger-entries-manually).

You can investigate the basis for matches by using the **Match Details** action. For example, the details include the names of the fields that contained matching values.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Match Automatically**. The **Match Bank Entries** page opens.
2. In the **Transaction Date Tolerance (Days)** field, specify the span of days before and after the bank account ledger entry posting date within which the action searches for matching transaction dates in the bank statement.

    If you enter 0 or leave the field blank, the **Match Automatically** action only searches for matching transaction dates on the bank account ledger entry posting date.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    The lines are color coded to make it easier to understand what to do with them. Bank statement lines and bank account ledger entries that are matched on the current bank reconciliation change to bold green font. Bank account ledger entries that are matched on other bank reconciliations are shown in italic blue font.
4. To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a mix of manual and automatic matching. If you have manually matched entries, automatic matching will not overwrite your selections.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually

> [!TIP]
> When matching lines and entries manually, the **Show All**, **Show Reversed Entries**, **Hide Reversed Entries**, and **Show Nonmatched** actions can make it easier to get an overview. By default, the bank account ledger entries don't include unmatched reversed entries. To include these entries in the list and match them manually, choose the **Show Reversed Entries** action. If you choose to hide reversed entries after you've made one or more matches, the matched entries are still shown.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't post a bank reconciliation if you do many-to-one matching and the combined amounts contain differences. This is true even if the combined differences balance to zero.
>
> Here's an example of a many-to-one matching that has differences. The value of 200 for bank statement entry 1 is matched to two bank ledger entries that have a total value of 180. The difference is 20. The value of 350 for bank statement 2 is matched to two other bank ledger entries that have a total value of 370. The difference is -20, which balances the value of 20 for bank statement 1.  
>
> To post a bank reconciliation with differences on the lines, post the differences and then match them against the posted entries.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, select an unapplied line in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane.
2. In the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, select one or more banks account ledger entries that can be matched with the selected bank statement line. To choose multiple lines, select and hold the CTRL key, and then choose the lines.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also manually match multiple bank statement lines with one bank account ledger entry. For example, this might be useful if your bank deposit contained several payment methods, such as credit cards from different issuers, and your bank lists those as separate lines.
3. Choose the **Match Manually** action.

    The selected bank statement line and the selected bank account ledger entries change to green font, and the **Applied** checkbox in the right pane is selected.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all bank statement lines that aren't matched.

> [!TIP]
> To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action. If you have matched multiple bank statement lines to a ledger entry, and need to remove one or more of the matched lines, all of the manual matches are removed for the ledger entry when you choose **Remove Match**.

## Validate your bank reconciliation

To double-check your bank account reconciliation before you post it, use the **Test Report** action to preview the reconciliation. The report is available in the following contexts:

* When you're preparing a bank reconciliation on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
* When you're reconciling payments on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

Lines that can't be matched stay on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. These lines contain a value in the **Difference** field. The difference represents a discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Reconciliation page and Test Report assume you're only reconciling within the period up until the statement ending date. If you match a bank statement line to a bank ledger entry before you enter a statement ending date, and then enter a statement ending date that is after the ending date for the bank ledger entry, the data in the Test Report will be incorrect.

The following table describes fields on the Test Report that can help you complete the bank reconciliation.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Statement Date| The date specified in the **Statement Date** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.|
|Balance Last Statement|The balance specified in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. This field is filled in automatically from the most recent reconciliation for the same bank account. The value is zero if it's is your first bank account reconciliation.|
|Statement Ending Balance|The balance specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> | The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. If your bank uses your local currency, this balance should be the same as your bank account balance (shown on the right side of the report header) when you match all statement lines. An empty **()** in the name of this field means that your bank uses local currency.<br><br>A discrepancy in this field and the previous ones might indicate that you posted directly to the G/L account. It might also indicate that you're using the same G/L account for multiple banks, which we don't recommend. Banks are linked to the general ledger through the bank account posting group specified for the account.<br><br>The Test Report shows a warning if you have direct postings, even if the balance for the posting is zero. Direct postings that aren't balanced often lead to accumulated differences for future bank reconciliations. You should check the general ledger balance and ledger entries before you post the bank reconciliation. Learn more in about direct posting in [Avoid Direct Posting](#avoid-direct-posting).|
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance (<*LCY*>) at <*date*>| The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date in local currency. The balance is converted to the bank account's currency using the exchange rate that was valid on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. You compare to this balance to the **G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*>* field if your bank uses a foreign currency. The value in the G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> field for local currency might differ slightly because currency conversion can result in small differences. Your bank's balance should be very close to this balance.  |
|Bank Account Balance at <*date*>| The balance on the bank account at the statement ending date.|
|Sum of Differences    | The sum of the differences for the statement lines. To access the details, turn on the **Print Outstanding Transactions** toggle when you enter criteria for the report. A difference is a bank statement line that isn't matched completely to one or more bank ledger entries. You can't post a bank account reconciliation that has differences. You can post a bank reconciliation that contains bank ledger entries that aren't matched to statement lines. This value is shown in the **Outstanding Bank Transactions** field and in a separate section if you turn on the Print Outstanding Transactions toggle.      |
|Statement Balance     | The value specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.  |
|Outstanding Bank Transactions     | The sum of unmatched, non-check bank ledger entries that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, at the end of a period. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Outstanding Checks     | The sum of unmatched bank ledger entries for checks that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, this can happen for checks if a vendor doesn't cash a check in the same period you registered it. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Bank Account Balance     | The sum of the values for the bank statement ending balance, outstanding bank transactions, and outstanding checks. After you handle all differences on matched entries, this balance matches your bank balance. For example, you accounted for all matched entries and the entries you couldn't match for this bank statement. You can post the reconciliation.        |

> [!TIP]
> If you run the **Test Report** from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** as follows:
>
> * balance last statement + sum of all lines in the payment reconciliation journal
>
> You can use the value to compare to your bank statement.

## To create missing ledger entries to match bank statement lines

Sometimes bank statement contains amounts for interest or fees charged. Such bank statement lines can't be matched because there aren't related ledger entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You must then post a journal line for each transaction to create a related ledger entry that it can be matched with.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Transfer to General Journal** action.  
2. On the **Trans. Bank Rec. to Gen. Jnl.** page, specify which general journal to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The **General Journals** page opens with new journal lines for any banks statement lines that are missing ledger entries.
3. Complete the journal line with information such as the balancing account. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  
4. To review the result of posting before you post, choose the **Test Report** action, and then choose an option for accessing the report. The **Bank Account Statement** report shows the same fields as at the header of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

    After the entry is posted, match the bank statement line to it.
6. Refresh or reopen the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. The new ledger entry appears in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
7. Match the bank statement line with the bank account ledger entry, either manually or automatically.

## Find outstanding transactions in previous periods

You can use the Bank Statement report to find outstanding transactions in previous periods. Outstanding transactions were opened before the statement date and aren't closed, or were closed after the bank reconciliation was posted.

When you run the Bank Statement report from the **Bank Account Statement List** page, you can turn on the **Outstanding Entries** toggle, and the report includes a section that lists outstanding entries.

**Example**
We have bank account ledger entries A, B, and C in our bank account for the month of August. When we reconcile our bank account for August we find a bank statement line that matches entry A, but none for B and C. So we post the reconciliation with entry A reconciled and B and C as outstanding entries.

In September, we receive a payment for entry B and decide to reconcile our bank account. If we run the Bank Statement report before posting the reconciliation, we get one reconciled transaction and one outstanding.

If we print the report for August we get outstanding transactions for our B and C entries, even though we closed entry B in September.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Statement report has some known limitations if you import or manually enter bank transactions after you post a bank reconciliation.
>
> You can enter bank ledger entries on any date and with any posting date, so you don't always have to do it in a strict chronological order.. When you do a bank reconciliation, you reconcile a bank statement to the bank ledger entries you have registered up to the time you post the reconciliation, and with the posting date of the entries. Typically, that means a posting date on or before the statement ending date.
>
> When you post a bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes a snapshot of the data and uses it to fill in the bank statement report's header. But, the outstanding transactions sections are actual lookups to the bank ledger entries that existed up to the actual date and time you posted the bank reconciliation. The totals in the lines typically match the totals in the header. However, if you import bank ledger entries after you posted the bank reconciliation, but the posting dates are before the statement ending date, the totals in the header might not match the totals in the outstanding transactions sections.

## Undo a bank account reconciliation

If you find a mistake in a posted bank reconciliation, you can use the **Undo** action on the **Bank Account Statement List** page to correct it. When you undo a posted bank reconciliation, the entries are moved to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** page and marked as **Open**, meaning they aren't reconciled. You can then correct the bank reconciliation and post it again.

> [!NOTE]
> In the North American version, to use the Undo feature for posted bank reconciliations and bank statements you must turn on the **Bank Recon. with Auto-Match** toggle on the **General Ledger Setup** page. The Undo feature is not available for bank statements posted from bank reconciliation worksheets.

### Reusing the bank statement number

The bank statement number used for the new bank reconciliation is taken from the bank account as is the Balance Last Statement. You can change these values before you start a new bank reconciliation. However, when you create a new bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] checks whether the statement number is already assigned to a posted bank statement. If the number is in use, but you want the new bank statement to use it instead, you can use the **Change Statement No.** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

### Examples

The following examples show how to fix a mistake on a posted bank reconciliation, with or without using the same statement number.

#### Example 1

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, and March. The bank statement number was 100 for March. Later, you discover that March only included entries until the 30th, which means entries for the 31st are missing. So, you need to redo the bank reconciliation for March. In this case, we open the **Bank Account Statement List** page, choose the statement for March, and then choose **Undo**.

The new bank reconciliation is given the statement number 101. To reassign the number 100, choose **Change Statement No.** and enter **100**. 

> [!TIP]
> Remember to set the appropriate Statement ending date (in this example, that is March 31), and edit the **Balance Last Statement** field. 

#### Example 2

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, June, and July. You discover that February was incorrect. Let's assume it had statement number 100. Like Example 1, you use the Undo and Change Statement No. actions to change the statement number as in example #1 and you can now redo February bank reconciliation.  

After you post the corrected bank reconciliation for February, on the corresponding Bank Account card the **Last Statement No.** field will show **100**, and the **Balance Last Statement** field will show the ending balance for the February statement. 

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for March, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will assign 101 as the statement number and give it the correct **Balance Last Statement**.

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for August, consider changing the values in the **Last Statement No.** and **Balance Last Statement** fields on the **Bank Account** card before you create the next bank reconciliation, or use the **Change Statement No.** action and also change the value in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the bank reconciliation page.

> [!NOTE]
> The statement number is important when you do bank reconciliations with imported CAMT files that contain statement numbers, or when you reconcile based on printed bank statements. If you just download a range of bank transactions from your online bank, the statement number is usually not important.  
>
> The Balance Last Statement is kept on the bank account to minimize mistakes when doing bank reconciliations, but it's also editable, allowing you to do your bank reconciliations in any order you want. This also means that if you undo a bank statement, the new ending balance might not be the balance last statement on the next bank statement. There's no feature that allows you to move a balance forward to all subsequent bank statements, so be aware of this when using Undo.  

## Avoid direct posting

Don't use a G/L account that allows direct posting in your bank account posting group. Direct posting breaks the connection between the bank account ledger entry and the G/L account ledger entry. When you reconcile your bank account, the entries posted directly to the G/L account aren't included, which makes it difficult to complete the reconciliation.

This mistake often happens when entering an opening balance for a bank account. It's important that you don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that are posted directly to the G/L account causes problems. For example, these entries might prevent you from reconciling your bank account. For foreign currency bank accounts, the entries can cause differences to accumulate after you post more bank reconciliations due to currency exchange rate adjustments. Often, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount then ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, you reverse it later against the G/L account that you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In both cases, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation, and especially so if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

# Classifying data sensitivity fields

To classify the fields that hold sensitive or personal data, a Microsoft partner can set the ```DataClassification``` property on fields. This requires access to the database tables, either through the development environment or by running a Windows PowerShell script. For more information, see [Classifying Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).  

As a customer, you can add a second level of classification by specifying sensitivity levels for the data you store in standard and custom fields. Classifying data sensitivity helps ensure that you know where you keep personal data in your system, and makes it easier to respond to requests from data subjects. For example, if a contact or customer asks you to export their personal data. For more information, see [Responding to Requests About Personal Data](admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

> [!Important]  
> Microsoft is providing this Data Sensitivity Classification feature as a matter of convenience only. It's your responsibility to classify the data appropriately and comply with any laws and regulations that are applicable to you. Microsoft disclaims all responsibility towards any claims related to your classification of the data.  

The following table describes data sensitivity levels you can assign.

|Sensitivity|Description|
|----|----|
|Sensitive | Information about a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, involvement with trade unions, physical or mental health, sexuality, or details about criminal offenses. |
|Personal | Information that can be used to identify a data subject, either directly or in combination with other data or information.|
|Confidential | Business data that you use for accounting or other business purposes, and do not want to expose to other entities. For example, this might include ledger entries.|
|Normal | General data that does not belong to any other categories.|

## How do I classify my data?

Classifying the sensitivity of a large number of fields one-by-one would take a long time. To help speed up the process, we provide tools that you can use to bulk classify the sensitivity of fields, and then fine-tune classifications for specific fields. You can find tools on the Data Classification Worksheet page, which is available on the Administration of users, user groups, and permissions Role Center. You must be a system administrator to use the worksheet.
 
> [!Important]  
> When you open the Data Classification Worksheet page for the first time, it will be empty. You must run the Data Classification guide to generate the list of fields. To start the guide, choose the **Set Up Data Classifications** action.

For example, the Data Classification Worksheet page lets you do things like:  

* Use the Data Classification guide to export your fields to an Excel worksheet where you can bulk classify them. Using the Excel worksheet is particularly useful if you are collaborating with a Microsoft partner. After you update the worksheet, you can use the guide to import and apply the classifications. You can also use the guide to classify fields manually.  
* Choose a field and then filter the list to find similar fields that are likely to belong to the same classification as the field you based the search on.  
* Investigate a field by viewing its contents.  

> [!Tip]  
> We have defined sample sensitivity classifications for the tables and fields in the Cronus demonstration company. You can use those classifications as inspiration when you classify your own tables and fields.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Design

Item tracking in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] started with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The item tracking functionality is in a separate object structure with intricate links to posted documents and item ledger entries, and it is integrated with the reservation system, which handles reservation, order tracking, and action messaging. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md) in the Supply Planning design details.  

This design incorporates item tracking entries in total availability calculations throughout the system, including planning, manufacturing, and warehousing. Serial and lot numbers are applied on the item ledger entries to ensure simple access to historical data for item tracking purposes. With 2021 release wave 1, item tracking in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes package numbers.  

With the addition of serial, lot, and package numbers, the reservation system handles permanent item attributes while also handling intermittent links between supply and demand in the form of order tracking entries and reservation entries. Another different characteristic of serial or lot numbers compared to the conventional reservation data is the fact that they can be posted, either partially or fully. Therefore, the **Reservation Entry** table (T337) now works with a related table, the **Tracking Specification** table (T336), which manages and displays summing across active and posted item tracking quantities. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  

The following diagram outlines the design of item tracking functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

![Example of item tracking flow.](media/design_details_item_tracking_design.png "Example of item tracking flow")  

The central posting object is redesigned to handle the unique subclassification of a document line in the form of serial or lot numbers, and special relation tables are added to create the one-to-many relations between posted documents and their split item ledger entries and value ledger entries.  

Codeunit 22, **Item Jnl. – Post Line**, now splits the posting according to the item tracking numbers that are specified on the document line. Each unique item tracking number on the line creates its own item ledger entry for the item. This means that the link from the posted document line to the associated item ledger entries is now a one-to-many relation. This relation is handled by the following item tracking relation tables.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Item Entry Relation** (T6507)|Relates shipped or received lines to item ledger entries|  
|**Value Entry Relation** (T6508)|Relates invoiced lines to value entries|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure](design-details-item-tracking-posting-structure.md).

# Design Details: Production Order Posting
Similar to assembly order posting, the consumed components and the used machine time are converted and output as the produced item when the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.


Transactions that occur during the manufacturing process can be tracked through the following stages:  

1.  Purchase of materials and other manufacturing inputs.  
2.  Conversion into work in process.  
3.  Conversion into finished goods inventory.  
4.  Sale of finished goods.  

Therefore, apart from regular inventory accounts, a manufacturing company must establish three separate inventory accounts to record transactions at various stages of production.  

|Inventory Account|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Raw Materials account**|Includes the cost of raw materials that are purchased but not yet transferred to production. The balance in the Raw Materials account indicates the cost of raw materials on hand.<br /><br /> When raw materials move into the production department, the cost of the materials is transferred from the Raw Materials account to the WIP account.|  
|**Work in Process (WIP) account**|Accumulates the costs that are incurred during production in the accounting period. The WIP account is debited for the cost of raw materials that are transferred from the raw materials warehouse, the cost of direct labor performed, and the manufacturing overhead costs that are incurred.<br /><br /> The WIP account is credited for the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed in the factory and transferred to the finished goods warehouse.|  
|**Finished Goods account**|This account includes the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed but not yet sold. At the time of sale, the cost of units sold is transferred from the Finished Goods account to the Cost of Goods Sold account.|  

The inventory value is calculated by tracking the costs of all increases and decreases, as expressed by the following equation:  

* inventory value = beginning balance of inventory + value of all increases - value of all decreases  

Depending on the type of inventory, increases and decreases are represented by different transactions.  

||Increases|Decreases|  
|-|---------------|---------------|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  
|**WIP inventory**|-   Material consumption<br />-   Capacity consumption<br />-   Manufacturing overhead|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|  
|**Finished goods inventory**|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|-   Sales (cost of goods sold)<br />-   Negative output|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  

The values of increases and decreases are recorded in the different types of manufactured inventory in the same way as for purchased inventory. Every time a transaction of inventory increase or decrease takes place, an item ledger entry and a corresponding general ledger entry are created for the amount. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

Although values of transactions that are related to purchased goods are posted only as item ledger entries with related value entries, transactions that are related to produced items are posted as capacity ledger entries with related value entries, in addition to the item ledger entries.  

## Posting Structure  
Posting production orders to WIP inventory involves output, consumption, and capacity.  

The following diagram shows the involved posting routines in codeunit 22.  

![Production order posting routines.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_1.png "Production order posting routines")  

The following diagram shows the associations between the resulting entries and the cost objects.  

![Production entry flow.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_2.png "Production entry flow")  

The capacity ledger entry describes the capacity consumption in terms of time units, whereas the related value entry describes the value of the specific capacity consumption.  

The item ledger entry describes the material consumption or output in terms of quantities, whereas the related value entry describes the value of this specific material consumption or output.  

A value entry that describes WIP inventory value can be associated with one of the following combinations of cost objects:  

-   A production order line, a work or machine center, and a capacity ledger entry.  
-   A production order line, an item, and an item ledger entry.  
-   Only a production order line  

For more information about how costs from production and assembly are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Capacity Posting  
Posting output from the last production order routing line results in a capacity ledger entry for the end item, in addition to its inventory increase.  

 The capacity ledger entry is a record of the time that was spent to produce the item. The related value entry describes the increase of the WIP inventory value, which is the value of the conversion cost. For more information, see “From the Capacity Ledger” in [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Production Order Costing  
 To control inventory and production costs, a manufacturing company must measure the cost of production orders, because the predetermined standard cost of each produced item is capitalized in the balance sheet. For information about why produced items use the Standard costing method, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In environments that do not use the Standard costing method, the actual rather than the standard cost of produced items is capitalized on the balance sheet.  

The actual cost of a production order consists of the following cost components:  

-   Actual material cost  
-   Actual capacity cost or subcontractor cost  
-   Manufacturing overhead  

These actual costs are posted to the production order and compared to the standard cost to calculate variances. Variances are calculated for each of the item cost components: raw materials, capacity, subcontractor, capacity overhead, and manufacturing overhead. The variances can be analyzed to determine problems, such as excessive waste in processing.  

In standard-cost environments, the costing of a production order is based on the following mechanism:  

1.  When the last routing operation is posted, the production order cost is posted to the item ledger and set to the expected cost.  

    This cost equals the output quantity that is posted in the output journal multiplied by the standard cost that is copied from the item card. The cost is treated as expected cost until the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This differs from assembly order posting, which always posts actual costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  
2.  When the production order is set to **Finished**, the order is invoiced by running the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. As a result, the total cost of the order is calculated based on the standard cost of the consumed materials and capacity. The variances between the calculated standard costs and the actual production costs are calculated and posted.

# Add Business Central tab in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In Teams, tabs appear at the top of channels and chats, giving participants quick access to pertinent information. This article explains different ways to add a tab that displays [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

## About Business Central tabs

A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab provides a focused view of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list and card pages. The tab doesn't display the full [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client. There's no browser border, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] banner (for example with Tell Me, search, help) or top navigation menu&mdash;just page content and its actions. The content is interactive, meaning that you can select actions and links, change data, and more. You're limited to what you see and can do by the same permissions assigned to your account in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Learn more about who can view the content of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab in [Who can see the content of a tab?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#who-can-view).

> [!TIP]
> Are you a developer? You can also add tabs programmatically using the Microsoft Graph API. Learn more in [Add Business Central Tabs to Teams](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-for-teams-tabs).  

## Prerequisites

To add a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

To view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab that was added by another participant in the channel or chat, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license or limited access to Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license only. Learn more in [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

## Add tab using recommended content

Use these steps to add a tab by choosing what to display from a readily available list of recommended content that's based your role center&mdash;without leaving Teams. Learn more about the content that you can choose from in [Where does the recommended content come from?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#where-does-the-recommended-content-come-from).

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon and wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window.png)

3. The **Choose from content recommended for** option shows the company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you working with. If you want to show content from another company, select the current company, then use the **Environment** and **Company** options to specify company you want to work with.
4. Select down arrow in the **Tab content** option and choose the content that you want to display.

   <!-- The list shows all pages that are bookmarked on your role center in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the content that you can choose from, see [Where does the recommended content come from?](teams-faq.md#recommended-content).-->
5. Some pages may include different views, which are variations of the page that's filtered to show specific data. To change the view for the content, select the down arrow for the **Preferred view** option and choose the view from the list.

   Learn more in [Save and Personalize Views](ui-views.md).
6. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
7. Select **Save**.

## Add tab using a page link

Another way to add a tab by using a link (URL) to the page that you want to show. This way is useful when you want to display a specific [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record or a list page that isn't bookmarked on your role center.

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon.
3. Wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear, then select **Paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link instead** option.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and highlights the link option](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-page-link.png)
4. Go to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and open the page that you want to display in the tab.
5. Copy the link to the page.

   There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. The other way is to copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar. Learn more in [Sharing Business Central Records and Page Links](across-working-with-teams.md).

6. Go back to Teams and paste the link in the **URL** box.
7. In the **Tab name** box, enter a name that displays on the tab.
8. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
9. Select **Save**.

## Change a tab and its content

After a tab has been added, you can make certain changes to the tab. For example, you can rename the tab, move it, and remove it. You find these actions in the tab options that are available by selecting the down arrow on the tab.

![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and the tab options menu](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-options-2.png)

As for the content of a tab, you can modify the data, if you have permission. If you change the data, others won't see the changes until they leave the tab and come back. The same is true for you if someone else makes changes to data. You can't change the page that displays on the tab, so just remove the tab and add another one the suits.

You can also change your view of the page and its data, like sorting and switching the layout between list and tile views. When you make these kinds of changes, they won't affect what others see. They see what you originally posted, until they make similar changes themselves.

# Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot's autofill feature assists you by automatically filling in editable blank fields on your page. Use autofill when creating or modifying a record. It suggests field values that you can choose to keep or discard. These suggestions are based on your Business Central data, such as frequently or recently used values, or they can be AI-generated based on option values, lookup values, or page context.

When Copilot generates suggestions, it only accesses the business data you can access. Copilot never saves suggestions automatically but presents them for you to decide what to keep. Copilot uses AI, and suggestions might not be correct.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

<!--Suggestions are based on Business Central that only you have access to.-->

## Prerequisites

Autofill is activated, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

### Where the autofill feature is available

The autofill feature is available on card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**, and only on editable fields in FastTabs on these pages, except for the fields listed in the following section.

> [!NOTE]  
> Autofill works on editable fields in FastTabs added to card and document pages by add-on apps (extensions).

### Where the autofill feature isn't available

The autofill feature isn't available on these types of pages:

- List pages like **Customers** and **Sales Orders**.
- Worksheet pages like the **Put-away Worksheet**.
- Setup pages, like **Company information** and **General Ledger Setup**, and assisted setup pages, like **Set up sales tax** and **Set up outgoing email**.
- Task dialogs.

The autofill feature isn't available on these fields regardless of the page type:

- Noneditable fields.
- Fields in the FactBox pane.
- Fields in rows and columns.
- Multiline text fields.
- Masked fields like passwords and secrets.
- Date and time fields.
- Toggle switches.
- Fields that uniquely identify a record like IDs and numbers from a series.
- Certain fields depending on your country/region. For example, Copilot can't make suggestions for address fields until web search powered by Bing is available in your country/region.

## Use autofill on fields

Open the page for editing, select a field, and then select the ![Shows the Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/copilot-star-unfilled.png) **Suggest a value for this field and related fields** icon or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. If the icon doesn't appear, autofill isn't available for the field, so try another field.

![Shows a card page with a Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/autofill-field.svg)

Suggestions are generated only for fields in the FastTab that you are on. When Copilot finds suggestions, they're automatically entered in the fields in italics along with the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon. Fields remain unchanged if suggestions aren't found or they don't support the autofill feature.

![Shows a suggested field with the accept and discard buttons.](media/autofill-suggested-value-field.svg)

When you hover over or select a field that includes a suggestion, the ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** and ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** buttons appear.

### Review suggestions

Review the suggestion for each field and take appropriate action. Suggestions aren't saved until you accept them.

- To learn more about a suggestion, select the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon next to the field, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. The details include the source of the suggestion, like the most frequently or recently used value. Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to give feedback.
- To keep a suggestion, select ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To reject a suggestion and keep the original value, select ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** or press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
- To change a suggestion, select **Change** in the details or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.

You can also use the **Keep all** button in the upper right corner of the page to accept or discard suggestions on all fields.

When you leave the page while there are unaccepted suggestions, Copilot asks you to accept or discard suggestions first.

<!--The first time you use Copilot, you're asked to accept the terms to continue.-->

## Autofill behavior with other data-entry features

Business Central offers many other features that reduce data entry, such as customer templates and business process settings that default values. On some pages, for example, when you specify the value for a field, Business Central validates and automatically sets related fields, like zip code and country. Unlike Copilot, these features don't use AI, and values are saved immediately.

When Copilot suggests a field value and you use any feature that saves a value to the same field, Copilot's suggestion is always discarded in favor of the value set by Business Central.

title: Reclassify fixed assets
description: You reclassify a fixed asset to transfer it to a different department, split it up, or combine it with other fixed assets.

# Transfer, split, or combine fixed assets

You can reclassify a fixed asset to transfer it to a different department, split it up, or combine it with other fixed assets. These registrations are done using the fixed asset reclassification journal.

To explore the results of fixed asset reclassifications, use the [Fixed Asset Book Value 02](reports/report-5606.md) report.

## To transfer a fixed asset to a different department

You might need to transfer a fixed asset to a different department. For example, when you put an asset in the production department for assembly and then move it to the administration department afterward.  

1. Set up a new fixed asset. Enter the new department as a dimension.  
2. Assign a fixed asset depreciation book to the new fixed asset. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create a journal line where the **FA No.** field contains the original fixed asset, and the **New FA No.** field contains the new fixed asset to be moved. Fill in the other fields as appropriate.  
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specify on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.    
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 and 5.

If you posted an acquisition cost for an asset, you can use the fixed asset reclassification journal to split the acquisition cost among several assets.  

## To split a fixed asset into three fixed assets

You can split one fixed asset into multiple fixed assets. For example, when you need to distribute a fixed asset across three departments. In that case, you might move 25 percent of the acquisition cost and depreciation for the original fixed asset to the second fixed asset, and 45 percent to the third asset. The remaining 30 percent remains on the original fixed asset.

1. Set up two new fixed assets. Enter the relevant departments as dimensions.  
2. Assign fixed asset depreciation books to the new fixed assets. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create two reclassification journal lines, one for each new fixed asset.
5. On the first line, enter the second fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **25** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
6. On the second line, enter the third fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **40** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
7. On both lines, select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.  
8. Choose the **Reclassify** action.  

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).    
9. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
10. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 through 8.


## To combine two fixed assets into one

You can combine multiple fixed assets into one fixed asset, for example when you move distributed fixed assets into one department. If you posted acquisition costs and depreciation for the fixed asset to move, those values are combined in the single fixed asset.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a reclassification journal where the **FA No.** field contains the fixed asset to move or combine, and the **New FA No.** field contains the combined fixed asset.
3. Leave the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field empty to move/combine the entire acquisition cost.  
4. Select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **Fixed Asset Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 2 through 5.

## To view changed depreciation book values due to fixed asset reclassification

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Book Value 02**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.  

For more information, see [Fixed Asset Book Value 02 (report)](reports/report-5606.md).

# Set Up Customer Price Groups
  
Sales prices can be made dependent on the customer groups to which you sell. These are called customer price groups.

Before you set up customer price groups, you must decide how many groups you want and which customers will belong to each group.  

## How to create sales prices for a group of customers  

When you have agreed on the prices that the group of customers will pay for certain items, you register the agreement for the individual items on the lines in the **Sales Prices** page.

### To create sales prices for a group of customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the customer price group. If a line does not already exist you can create a new line. Select **New** to create a new entity and give it a name.  
    
    For the selected line, verify the contents of the fields **Allow Line Disc.**, **Allow Invoice Disc.**, **Price Includes Tax** and **Tax Bus. Posting Gr. (Price)**. 
  
3. Select the **Navigate** action, and choose **Sales Prices**. The **Sales Prices** page opens. The **Sales Type** field will be filled in with **Customer Price Group**.  
  
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** with the sales code you selected on the previous page.  
  
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Item No.**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the agreed **Unit Price**. You can also show the **Variant Code** column and specify the **Variant Code** if there are several variants of the item.  
  
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the price agreed on, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.  

7. If required, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** of the price agreement.  
  
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code**.

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item that you want to create a Sales Price for.

# Defining and allocating costs

Cost allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. You can define as many allocations as you need. Each allocation consists of:  

- An allocation source.  
- One or more allocation targets.  

The allocation source establishes which costs must be allocated, and the allocation targets determine where the costs must be allocated. For example, an allocation source can be the costs for the Electricity and Heating cost type. You allocate all electricity and heating costs to three cost centers: Workshop, Production, and Sales. These cost centers are your allocation targets.  

For each allocation source, you define an allocation level, a validity period, and a variant as grouping identifier. You can use a batch job to set filters to select allocation definitions and then run cost allocations automatically.  

For each allocation target, you define an allocation base. The allocation base can be either static or dynamic.  

- Static allocation bases are based on a definite value, such as square footage or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.  
- Dynamic allocation bases depend on changeable values, such as the number of employees in a cost center or sales revenue of a cost object throughout a certain time period.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

## Set up allocation source and targets

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. The allocation source defines which costs will be allocated. The allocation targets determine where the costs will be allocated.  

### To set up cost allocations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then chose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Enter an ID for the allocation source in the **ID** field.  
4. Define a level as a number between 1 and 99 in the **Level** field. The allocation posting will follow the order of the levels.  
5. Enter a cost type to define which cost types will be allocated in the **Cost Type Range** field. If all costs for a cost type are allocated, no range is defined.  
6. Enter a cost center together with costs to be allocated in the **Cost Center Code** field.  
7. Enter a cost object together with costs to be allocated in the **Cost Object Code** field. Most often, this field stays empty, because cost objects are rarely allocated to other cost objects.  
8. Enter a cost type in the **Credit to Cost Type** field. The costs that are allocated will be credited to the source cost type. The credit posting will be posted to the cost type given here.  
9. On the **Lines** FastTab, define the allocation targets. On the first line, enter a cost type in the **Target Cost Type** field. It defines which cost type the allocation is debited to.  
10. On the first line, enter the first allocation target in the **Target Cost Center** field or **Target Cost Object** the field. These two fields define which cost center or cost object the allocation is debited to. You can only fill in one of these fields, but not both.  
11. Repeat the same steps on the second line to set up additional allocation targets.  
12. After you have set up the allocation target and sources, choose the **Calculate Allocation Key** action to calculate the total share values.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Blocked** check box to deactivate the allocation setup.

## To set filters for dynamic allocation bases

The dynamic allocation method is based on changeable values. For example, the number of employees in a cost center or the items sold of a cost object in a specific time period. There are nine pre-defined allocation bases and twelve dynamic date ranges. You set different filters based on the allocation base.  

### Set filters

The following table shows which filters are possible for different allocation bases and which values are valid in the **No. Filter** and **Group Filter** fields. Select <kbd>F1</kbd> in the **Date Filter Code** field to read detailed descriptions.  

|**Base**|**No. Filter**|**Date Filter Code**|**Cost Center Filter**|**Cost Object Filter**|**Group Filter**|  
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
|G/L Entries|G/L Account|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|G/L Budget Entries|G/L Account|Yes|Yes|Yes|G/L Budget Name|  
|Cost Type Entries|Cost Type|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|Cost Budget Entries|Cost Type|Yes|Yes|Yes|Budget Name|  
|No of Employees|N/A|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|Items Sold (Qty)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Purchased (Qty)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Sold (Amount)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Purchased (Amount)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|

## Scenario 1: Defining static allocations based on allocation ratio

Static allocation method is based on a definite value, such as square meters used, or an established allocation ratio such as 5:2:4.  

This article describes how to define three new allocation target cost objects for the allocation source PROD cost center using the established allocation ratio 5:2:4. The three target cost objects are ACCESSO, PAINT, and FITTINGS.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The example uses the demo data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To define the allocation source PROD cost center on the General FastTab  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **ID** field, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> or enter an ID.  
4. In the **Level** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Valid From** and **Valid To** fields, enter appropriate dates.  
6. In the **Cost Center Code** field, enter **PROD**.  
7. In the **Credit to Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  

### To define the allocation target cost objects on the Lines FastTab  

1. On the first line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
2. On the first line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **ACCESSO**.  
3. On the first line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
4. On the first line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
5. On the first line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **5**.  
6. On the second line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
7. On the second line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **PAINT**.  
8. On the second line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
9. On the second line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
10. On the second line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **2**.  
11. On the third line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
12. On the third line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **FITTINGS**.  
13. On the third line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
14. On the third line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
15. On the third line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **4**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the **Percent** field using a percentage rate that is dependent on all three allocation ratios that are entered in the **Share** field for all three lines.

## Scenario 2: Defining dynamic allocations based on Items sold

This topic shows an example of how to define allocations by using the dynamic allocation method. In the example, you change the dynamic allocation of the costs for the SALES cost center to support the new cost object IT EQUIPMENT. IT EQUIPMENT packages have item numbers in the range from 8904-W to 8924-W. You use the previous year’s sales figures to calculate the share. The allocation is posted to the helping cost type 9903.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The example uses the demo data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To define dynamic allocations based on items sold in the previous year  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **ID** field, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> or enter an ID.  
4. In the **Level** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Valid From** and **Valid To** fields, enter appropriate dates.  
6. In the **Cost Center Code** field, enter **SALES**.  
7. In the **Credit to Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  
8. In the **Target Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  
9. In the **Target Cost Object** field, choose **New** to create a new cost object IT EQUIPMENT and fill in fields as necessary. Select **IT EQUIPMENT**. Leave the **Target Cost Center** field blank.  
10. In the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accumulated costs are allocated.  
11. In the **Base** field, select the allocation base **Items Sold (Amount)**.  
12. In the **No. Filter** field, enter **8904-W..8924-W**.  
13. In the **Date Filter Code** field, enter **Last Year**.  
14. Choose the **Calculate Allocation Key** action to calculate the share.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the previous years’ sales figures to calculate a share of 1596.50 LCY with 100 percent for the IT EQUIPMENT packages. This means that all of the items sold last year will be allocated to the cost object IT EQUIPMENT.

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.  

### To synchronize records of an integration table mapping  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Define Retention Policies

This article describes how administrators can define retention policies to specify how often to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries can make it easier to work with the more relevant data. Policies can delete data based on an expiration date, or you can add filters to include only certain expired data.

## Required setups and permissions

Before you can create retention policies, you must set up the tables to include and the periods of time to keep data.

|Setup  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Allowed Tables**     |We provide a list of tables that you can include in retention policies. If you want to add tables from an extension to a retention policy, a developer must add their tables to the list. To learn more, go to [Include your extension in a retention policy](admin-data-retention-policies.md#include-your-extension-in-a-retention-policy-requires-help-from-a-developer).          |
|**Retention Periods**     |Specify periods of time for which to keep data in the tables in a policy. The periods determine how often data is deleted.         |

Additionally, you must have the **SUPER** user permissions or the **Retention Policy Setup** permission set. Users who have the Retention Policy Setup permission set can define retention policies for tables. That's true, even if they don't have Read and Delete permissions for the tables. The job queue entry must run as a user with permissions to read and delete the data. Don't grant the Retention Policy Setup permission set to users who shouldn't be allowed to delete data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and you want to try out retention policies in the the Cronus demonstration database, there are a few things you need to do. The demonstration company doesn't contain tables that you can use with retention policies, so you need to add them. To do that, create a new, blank company in the demonstration database. In the new company, import the RapidStart configuration package for your country/region that corresponds to the standard NAV17.0.W1.ENU.STANDARD.rapidstart package. The setup data for retention policies will be available in the new company.

### Create retention periods

Retention periods can be as long or as short as you want. To create retention periods, on the **Retention Policies** page, use the **Retention Period** action. The periods you define are available for all policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For compliance reasons, we have defined a minimum retention period for some tables. If you set a retention period that's shorter than minimum required, a message displays the mandatory period.

### Set up a retention policy

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Retention Policies**, and choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new retention policy. 
3. In the **Table ID** field, choose the table that you want to include in the policy.
4. In the **Retention Period** field, specify the length of time for which to keep the data in the table.
5. Optional: You can apply the policy to specific data in a table, rather than all records, by filtering the data for each line. The policy will apply only to the records that the filters return. To specify the filter criteria, turn off the **Apply to all records** toggle. The **Record Retention Policy** FastTab displays, where you can set filter criteria. To learn more about how filters work, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each line has its own retention period. If you specify different retention periods for the same data, the longest period is used. Also, some tables contain filters that you can't change or remove. To help you identify these filters, they appear in a lighter color font.

## Apply retention policies

You can use a job queue entry to apply retention policies to delete data automatically, or you can manually apply policies.

To apply a retention policy automatically, just create and enable a policy. When you enable a policy,, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a job queue entry that applies the it according to its retention period. All retention policies will use the same job queue entry. By default, the job queue entry applies the policy every day at 0200. You can change the default, but if you do we recommend that it runs outside business hours. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

You can manually apply a policy by using the **Apply Manually** action on the **Retention Policies** page. If you want to always apply a policy manually, turn on the **Manual** toggle. The job queue entry will disregard the policy when it runs.

## View retention policy log entries

You can view activity related to retention policies in the **Retention Policy Log** page. For example, entries are created when a policy is applied, or if errors occurred.

## Include your extension in a retention policy (requires help from a developer)

By default, retention policies cover only [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the list we provide. You can remove default tables from the list, and you can add tables that you own. That is, you can't add a table that you did not create yourself. For example, you can't add other tables from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from an extension that you have purchased.

To add your tables to the list of allowed tables, a developer must add some code. For example, to the installer codeunit for the extension (a codeunit with the *install* subtype).

When a developer adds a table, they can specify mandatory and default filters. Mandatory filters can't be removed or modified later when you add tables to define a retention policy. The default filters are just suggestions.

The following are examples of how to add a table to the list of allowed tables with, and without, mandatory or default filters. For a more complex example, go to codeunit 3999 "Reten. Pol. Install - BaseApp".

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
    begin
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Retention Policy Log Entry");
    end;
```

The following example includes a mandatory filter.

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        ChangeLogEntry: Record "Change Log Entry";
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
        RetentionPeriod: Enum "Retention Period Enum";
        RecRef: RecordRef;
        TableFilters: JsonArray;
        Enabled: Boolean;
        Mandatory: Boolean;
    begin
        ChangeLogEntry.Reset();
        ChangeLogEntry.SetFilter("Field Log Entry Feature", '%1|%2', ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::"Monitor Sensitive Fields", ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::All);
        RecRef.GetTable(ChangeLogEntry);
        Enabled := true;
        Mandatory := true;
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddTableFilterToJsonArray(TableFilters, RetentionPeriod::"28 Days", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), Enabled, Mandatory, RecRef);
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Change Log Entry", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), TableFilters);
    end;
```

After a developer has added tables to the list, an administrator can include them in a retention policy.

# Add marketing text to items

For any item registered in Business Central, you can write *marketing text* about the item. Although marketing text is a kind of description, it's different than an item's **Description** field. The **Description** field is typically used as a concise display name to quickly identify the product. The marketing text, on the other hand, is a more rich and descriptive text. Its purpose is to add marketing and promotional content, also known as *copy*. This text can then be published with the item if it's published on a web shop, like Shopify, or pasted into emails or other communications with your customers.

There are two ways to create the marketing text. The easiest way to get started is to use Copilot, which suggests AI-generated text for you. The other way is to start from scratch. 

## <a name=copilot></a>Get marketing text suggestions with Copilot

With Copilot, you quickly get a text suggestion that's automatically generated for you. The AI-generated text is tailored to the item and provides a good starting point. The text is based in part on the following information:

- Attributes defined for the item&mdash;for example, the description, color, dimensions, material, and so on. Learn more about item attributes in [Work with item attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).
- The item’s **Description** field.
- The item category. [Learn more about categorizing items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).
- Selectable style preferences like tone of voice, format, and length.

Copilot is designed to save you time and help you write creative and engaging text that reflects your brand and is consistent across your product line. Start by generating a suggestion, then change the suggested text as needed.

### Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

### Prerequisites

- The **Marketing text suggestions** capability is activated by an administrator. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

### Create first draft with Copilot

Complete the following steps to add marketing text to an existing item. Learn how to create a new item in [Register new items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

1. In Business Central, open the item that you want to modify by completing the following steps:

   - In the upper-right corner, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 22.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link to show a list of available items.

   - Double-click the item or select its value in the **No.** column.

1. From the item card, there are two ways to get started writing marketing text with Copilot: from the **Marketing Text** FactBox or using the **Marketing text** action. These methods are indicated in the following figure of an item card.  

   [![Shows an item card with Marketing Text pane](media/create-with-copilot.svg)](media/create-with-copilot.svg#lightbox)

   To create the first draft for an item, do one of the following steps:

   - In the **Marketing Text** pane in the FactBox on the right side of the page, select **Draft with Copilot**. 

     Copilot starts to draft the marketing text.

   - At the top of the page, select the **Marketing Text** action, then select **Draft with Copilot** on the **Edit Marketing Text** window.  The **Draft Marketing Text with Copilot** windows appears and lists all available attributes for the item.
1. Select the attributes you want Copilot base suggestions on, then select **Generate**. You can change the selected attributes and other options later. Copilot starts to draft the marketing text. 

   ![Shows the edit marketing text window](media/marketing-text-copilot-attributes.svg)

1. When Copilot completes the draft, the text appears in the Copilot editor window for you to review and edit.

   [![Shows the create with Copilot windows](media/create-with-copilot-window.svg)](media/create-with-copilot-window.svg#lightbox)

   You can now get more suggestions, try to improve the suggestions you get, edit text, and more. Go to [Review, edit, and save](#review-edit-and-save-text) for details.

### Review, edit, and save text

Once you have the first draft, you must review it and make changes to the text to get it ready for publishing. This work is done from the Copilot editor, which lets you get more suggestions, change preferences to influence the suggestions, and manually make changes and style the text.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AI-generated text from Copilot is only a suggestion and it can have mistakes. It requires human oversight and review to ensure it's accurate and appropriate. Review any suggested text and edit as needed before you save and publish it for public consumption.

Use the following guidelines to finalize and save the marketing text.

1. Make changes to text directly in the text box. Use the tool bar along the bottom of the box to format and style text, add links, and more.
2. To get a new suggestion, select **Regenerate**.
3. If you're not satisfied with the suggestions, enhance the text suggestions using the **Tone**, **Format**, and **Emphasis** preference options.

   <!--Select **More Settings**, change the options that are shown under **Choose how Copilot creates suggestions**, then select **Create draft** to get a new suggestion.-->

   For guidelines on improving suggestions, go to the [Improve and tailor text suggestions](#improve-and-tailor-text-suggestions).

4. To go back and forth through suggestions, use the previous and next links at the top of the page (*x* **of** *y*). <!-- or select the **...** (More formatting options) along the bottom of the window, then select **Undo**. Select **Redo** to go back.-->
5. Carefully review the text for accuracy and appropriateness:

   - If you want to save the text, select **Keep it**. 
   - If you don't want to save, select the discard button (trash can) ![Shows the trash can icon for deleting all Copilot proposal for bank account reconciliation](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png).

### Improve and tailor text suggestions

There are a few steps you can do to improve the text suggestions and tweak them to suit your personal or company's preferences.

1. Change the item attributes used by Copilot.

   Copilot suggestions are based, in part, on the attributes assigned to the item. To view the available attributes and current settings, select the edit ![Shows the edit icon on the Copilot window for changing attributes](media/edit-pencil.png) icon in the upper-left corner. In the **Item Attributes** page, choose the attributes that best align with the characteristics that you want to promote. The more relevant attributes you include, the richer the outcome becomes. If you feel you're missing some key attributes, add more. For more information about attributes, go to [Work with item attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md)
1. Change your preference settings for  **Tone**, **Format**, and **Emphasis** options.

   |Option|Description|
   |-|-|
   |Tone |Use this option to influence what kind of words, phrases, and punctuation are used to engage the target audience. You can choose from several predefined tones of voice, ranging from **Formal** (which results in a business tone) to **Creative** (which results in an informal tone). |
   |Format and length|Use this option to control the general structure of the text, which consists of three parts, covered by four different options: <ul><li>**Tagline** - A catchy phrase or short sentence that identifies the item or brand.</li><li>**Paragraph** - A single paragraph of fluent and verbose text, consisting of several complete sentences.</li><li>**Tagline + Paragraph** - A tagline followed by a paragraph</li><li>**Brief** - An introductory sentence, similar to a tagline, followed by a bulleted list of key points of interest.</li></ul> |
   |Emphasis|Use this option to choose from a list of predefined qualities that you want to emphasize in the text. Choose a quality that best aligns with the type of item you're writing about. The qualities don't directly correspond to the item's attributes, description, or category. For example, **Quality** could be a good choice for both a bike or desk, while **Speed** would suit a bike, but not a desk.|

1. Improve the **Description** field on the item card.

   The text in the **Description** field is used as-is in many places in the suggested text, so it's important that the description best portrays how you want the item referenced in the marketing text. 

1. Make sure the **Item Category Code** field on the item card is set to a proper category.

   Copilot finds words and phrases that are related to the category and work them into the suggested text.

### Working with multiple languages 

Text is always generated in the language defined by your user [settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language). If your organization operates and enters data into Business Central using a different language, or if Business Central is connected to your online store such as with Shopify, this might result in publishing content that doesn't match similar marketing content.

## Create text from scratch

1. In Business Central, open the item that you want to modify as follows:

    1. In the upper-right corner, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 22.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link to show a list of available items.
    2. To open the item, double-click it or select its number in the  **No.** field.

2. Do one of the following steps:

   - In the **Marketing Text** pane of the FactBox on the right side of the page, select **Edit**.
   - Select the **Marketing Text** action.
3. Make changes to text directly in the **Marketing Text** box. Use the tool bar along the bottom of the box to format and style text, add links, and more.
4. Select **OK** when done to save the text.
