| Report | Description | Id | 
|---------|---------|---------|
| [Quantity Explosion of BOM](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000753)|Shows an indented BOM listing for the item or items that you specify in the filters. The production BOM is completely exploded for all levels.|99000753|
| [Item - Able to Make (Time)](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5871)|Shows how five different key availability figures change over time for a BOM item. These figures change according to expected supply and demand events and to supply that is based on available components that can be assembled or produced.<br>You can use the report to see whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability in combination with the potential quantities that its components can supply if an assembly order has been started. The report shows you when and how many units of an assembly and production item you can make based on component availability and the item's current availability. This is shown as the total quantity.<br>The information is shown in a graph where each availability figure is a line that progresses along the timeline and moves up and down as quantities change. The quantity figures come from the same engine that provides information to the **Item Availability by BOM Level** window. |5871|
| [BOM Cost Share Distribution](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5872)|Shows graphically how an assembled or produced item’s cost is distributed through its BOM.<br>Such information can be useful in deciding, for example, whether to change component suppliers, replace internal capacity usage with outsourced labor or vice versa or when reviewing and modifying an item’s bill of material.<br>The first chart in the report shows the total unit cost of the parent item’s components and labor resources broken down in up to five different cost shares, and represented graphically with different colors.<br>The pie chart with the caption *By Material/Labor* shows the proportional distribution between the parent item’s material and labor costs, as well as its own manufacturing overhead. The material cost share includes the item's material costs. The labor cost share includes capacity, capacity overhead and subcontracted costs. The cost shares are displayed differently depending on your choices in the **Show only** field.<br>The pie chart with the caption *By Direct/Indirect* shows the proportional distribution between the parent item's direct and indirect costs. The direct cost share includes the item's material, capacity, and subcontracted costs. The indirect cost share includes capacity overhead and manufacturing overhead.<br>The table at the bottom of the report is included when you select the **Include Details** check box. It shows selected values from the BOM Cost Shares window by single level or rolled up, depending on your choices in the **Show Cost Shares as** field.|5872|
| [Detailed Calculation](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000756)|Shows a cost list per item taking into account the scrap.|99000756|
| [Where-Used (Top Level)](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000757)|Shows where and in what quantities the items are used in the product structure.<br>The report shows only the item as where-used, when the base item is used as the top-level item. For example, if item "A" is used to produce item "B", and item "B" is used to produce item "C", the report will show item B if you run this report for item A. If you run this report for item B, then item C will be shown as where-used.<br>You can also open the **Where-Used Line** page directly from the item.|99000757|
| [Item BOM Compare list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000758)|This report gives you the possibility to compare similar final products concerning the costs. You will see a listing with all components and their costs as well the needed quantities. The calculation date is normally set to the work date. |99000758|
| [Production Order Statistics](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000791)|Specifies the various costs that have accumulated for the selected production order.<br>The content of the report are very similar to the **Production Order Statistics** page.<br>For production orders that use the *Make-to-Order* manufacturing policy, the window only shows material and capacity cost of items at the highest BOM level.|99000791|
| [Capacity Task list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000780)|Shows the production orders that are waiting to be processed at the work centers and machine centers. Printouts are made for the capacity of the work center or machine center). The report includes information such as starting and ending time, date per production order and input quantity.|99000780|
| [Work Center Load](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000783)|Shows a list for the load on a work center. The load on a work center is the sum of the required number of times that all the planned and actual orders are run on the work center in a specified period.|99000783|
| [Machine Center Load](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000784)|Shows a list for the load on a machine center. The load on a machine center is the sum of the required number of times that all the planned and actual orders are run on the work center in a specified period.|99000784|
| [Prod. Order Shortage list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000788)|This report can be used to see all components that are not available because of missing stock. So, this overview can be used to see in time, if the timeline for a planned or released production order if the planned time can be kept.|99000788|
|[Prod. Order - Calculation](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=99000767)|Shows a list of the production orders and their costs. It includes expected operation costs, expected component costs, and total costs.|99000767|

Categories and attributes are two different ways of grouping inventory items. Item variant is a way to indicate that a specific item is available in different colors or sizes, for example. Depending on how you set up your inventory, you can use categories to group chairs versus desks, and then use attributes to group green items versus blue items, for example. You can then supplement this setup by adding variants to each type of chair and desk. By adding variants, you can run reports such as **Item Availability by Variant** to identify differences between the blue chairs versus the green chairs, for example.

Warehouse employees can ship and receive non-inventory items along with physical goods on sales and purchase orders. Non-inventory items are intangibles, such as insurance or extra costs.

Sales and purchase orders often have various types of things on their lines. For example, orders might include general ledger items, accounts, and fixed assets. If you use warehouse documents to handle physical items, you can also post some types of non-inventory items. The following are examples of warehouse documents:

* Inventory put-aways
* Warehouse receipts
* Inventory picks
* Warehouse shipments

To enable warehouse workers to ship and receive non-inventory items, fill in the **Auto Post Non-Invt. via Whse.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages. The field provides the following options:

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|None     |Do not ship or receive non-inventory items.         |
|Attached/Assigned     | Post item charges and other non-inventory item lines that are assigned or attached to physical items. To attach non-inventory lines to physical items, use the **Attach to inventory line** action.        |
|All     | Post all non-inventory lines on the source document as soon as at least one item is posted by the warehouse document.        |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Complete** option in the **Shipping Advice** field of the sales order has priority over the selection in the **Auto Post Non-Invt. via Whse.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.end of article

> [!NOTE]
> The following sections assume that you have administrator access for Exchange Online.

Before you can set up email logging, you must prepare Office 365 [public folders](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/public-folders). You can do this in the [Exchange admin center](/exchange/exchange-admin-center?preserve-view=true), or you can use the [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&?preserve-view=true).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use the [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true), you can find inspiration for how to set up your script in a sample script that we published in [the BCTech repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/EmailLogging).

Follow the steps below to set up Exchange Online, with links to where you can learn more.

### Create an admin role group

Create an admin role group for public folders based on the information in the following table:

|Property        |Value                     |
|----------------|--------------------------|
|Name            |Public Folders Management |
|Selected roles  |Public Folders            |
|Selected users  |The email of the user account that Business Central will use to run the email logging job|

For more information, see [Manage role groups in Exchange Online](/exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups).

### Create a new public folder mailbox

Create a new public folder mailbox based on the information in the following table:

|Property        |Value                     |
|----------------|--------------------------|
|Name            |Public MailBox            |

For more information, see [Create a public folder mailbox](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/create-public-folder-mailbox).

### Create new public folders

1. Create a new public folder with the name **Email Logging** in the root so that the full path to the folder becomes `\Email Logging\`.
2. Create two sub-folders so that the the result is the following full paths to the folders:

    - `\Email Logging\Queue\`
    - `\Email Logging\Storage\`

For more information, see [Create a public folder](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/create-public-folder).

### Set public folder ownership

Set the email logging user as an owner of both public folders, *Queue* and *Storage*.

For more information, see [Assign permissions to the public folder](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/set-up-public-folders#step-3-assign-permissions-to-the-public-folder).

### Mail-enable the *Queue* public folder

  For more information, see [Mail-enable or mail-disable a public folder](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/enable-or-disable-mail-for-public-folder).

### Mail-enable sending emails to the *Queue* public folder

Mail-enable sending emails to the *Queue* public folder using Outlook or the Exchange Management Shell.

For more information, see [Allow anonymous users to send email to a mail-enabled public folder](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/enable-or-disable-mail-for-public-folder#allow-anonymous-users-to-send-email-to-a-mail-enabled-public-folder?preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table:

|Purpose  |Name |Apply this rule if...             |Do the following...                          |
|---------|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|A rule for incoming email |Log Email Sent to This Organization|*The sender* is located *Outside the organization*, and *the recipient* is located *Inside the organization*|BCC the email account that is specified for the *Queue* public folder|
|A rule for outgoing email | Log Email Sent from This Organization |*The sender* is located *Inside the organization*, and *the recipient* is located *Outside the organization*|BCC the email account that is specified for the *Queue* public folder|

For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes in the Exchange Management Shell, the changes become visible in the Exchange admin center after a delay. Also, the changes made in Exchange will be available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales or purchase orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. An example is to set up a dimension called Department, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items.

## The old way
The following table describes some of the key reports for accounts payable.

| Report | Description | ID | 
|--|--|--|
| [Aged Accounts Payable](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=322) |Shows overdue balances for vendors in time intervals. The overdue amounts can show by due date, posting date, or by document date. You can choose to show the amounts in local currency (LCY) and print details of the overdue documents. The time intervals can have headings with dates or with number of dates overdue, relative to the specified aging by type.<br>This report is the main report for reconciling vendor ledger to G/L. Assuming that you don't post directly to the payables account for the vendor posting group, this report is a specification of the amounts in the general ledger.| 322|
| [Vendor - Balance to Date](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=321) | Shows the vendor balance by the ending date of the specified date range. You can choose to display the vendor balance in your local currency (LCY). Select the **Include Unapplied Entries** field to show entries that were closed by the ending date but were unapplied (opened) at a later date. Select the **Show Entries with Zero Balance** to show vendors with a balance of zero by the ending date of the date filter. The date filter applies to the detailed vendor ledger entries for the entries in the report. If a payment was made after the ending date, and the payment was applied to invoices within the date range, the report includes the invoice. The report includes the invoice because it wasn't closed before the ending date. | 321 |
| [Vendor - Trial Balance](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=329) | Shows the net changes for vendors for the period specified in the date filter, and the net change year-to-date for the corresponding fiscal year. The report is grouped by vendor posting groups and gives a different view of the vendor ledger than the **Aged Accounts Payable** report. **Note**: If you don't set up accounting periods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] doesn't know which fiscal year to use. It shows the year-to-date from the most recent fiscal year, or just the selected period. The date might not be from the beginning of a year.|329 |
| [Vendor - Detail Trial Balance](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=304) | Shows all the vendor ledger entries within the specified date filter. The report shows the vendor's beginning balances relative to the date filter. | 304 |
| [Purchase Statistics](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=312) |[!INCLUDE [reports-purchase-statistics](reports-purchase-statistics.md)]<br>This report can also be used in accounts payable as it's easier to do a quick look-up of posted payments, discounts, and other transactions for a given vendor.| 312 |
| [Vendor - Summary Aging](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=305)| Legacy report for aged accounts payable. We recommend that you use **Aged Accounts Payables** report instead. You can choose a period length and a date to use for an *overdue per* date.|305|
| [Payments on Hold](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=319)| Shows vendor ledger entries where the **On Hold** field isn't blank.| 319 |
| [Vendor Pre-Payment Journal](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=317)|Shows the payment journal with payment discount and tolerance information.

When you open the **Item Availability by Variant** page from a document line, then you can insert a variant in the document line by selecting the line with the variant that you want to insert and then choosing the OK button. If you've only used the page to view availability and don't want to insert a variant, then close the page without choosing the OK button.

The page shows one line for each period. Each line shows the item’s availability figures in the following key fields:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **Gross Requirement**| Specifies the sum of the total demand for the item. The gross requirement consists of *independent demand* and *dependent demand*. *Independent demand* includes sales orders, service orders, transfer orders, and production forecasts. *Dependent demand* includes production order components for planned, firm planned, and released production orders. It also includes requisition and planning worksheets lines.|
| **Scheduled Receipt** | Specifies the sum of items from replenishment orders. The calculation includes firm planned and released production orders, purchase orders, and transfer orders. |
| **Planned Order Receipt** | Specifies the sum of items from planned production orders. |
| **Projected Available Balance** | Specifies the calculated available inventory. |
| **Planned Order Releases** | Specifies the sum of items from replenishment order proposals. The calculation includes planned production orders. it also includes planning or requisition worksheets lines that are calculated according to the starting date in the planning worksheet and production order or the order date in the requisition worksheet. This sum isn't included in the projected available inventory. However, it indicates which quantities should be converted from planned to scheduled receipts. |

Column definitions aren't versioned. When you change a column definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with column definitions.

- If you add a column definition, choose a good code and fill in the Description field with meaningful text while you still know what you use the column definition for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) work with financial reporting and perhaps changing the column definition.
- Use the **Where-Used** action to learn where a column definition is used before making any changes to it.
- Before you change a column definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export column definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.end of article

You must set up a code for each currency you use if you:

- Buy or sell in other currencies besides your local currency (LCY).  
- Record general ledger transactions in both LCY and an additional reporting currency.  

After setting up the codes, assign the appropriate code to each foreign currency bank account, and assign a default currency code to foreign customer and vendor accounts.

You specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code.

Prepayments are payments that are invoiced and posted to a sales or purchase order before you post the final invoice. For example, you might require a deposit before you manufacture items to order, or you might require payment before you ship items to a customer. You can use the prepayments capabilities to invoice and collect deposits from customers, and to remit deposits to vendors. This way, all relevant payments are posted against the same invoice.

### Reversing Journals to Correct Mistakes

When working with journals that have many lines and something goes wrong, it's important to have an easy way to correct mistakes. The **Posted General Journal** page offers a couple of actions that can help.

* **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** - Copy only the lines that you select.
* **Copy G/L Register to Journal** - Copy all lines that belong to the same G/L register.

These actions let you create a copy of a general journal line or a batch, and then specify:

* The journal to copy the lines to
* Whether with opposite signs (a reversing journal)
* A different posting date or document number

To allow journals to be copied to posted general journals, on the **General Journal Templates** or **General Journal Batch** pages, choose the **Copy to Posted Jnl. Lines** checkbox. After you allow people to copy posted general journals, if needed you can turn off copying for specific batches.end of article

When you enter datetimes, which are a date and time combined into one field, you must enter a space between the date and the time. The date part can only contain spaces in the form of the official date separator of your region settings. The time can contain spaces around the AM/PM indicator in relevant regional settings.

<!--It is also possible to enter only a date in a datetime field, but it is not possible to enter only a time.-->

## The old way
The following table describes some of the key reports in fixed assets reporting.

| Report | Description | Id | 
|--|--|--|
| [Fixed Asset List](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5601)| Shows the list of fixed asset and their setup info for a given depreciation book. |5601 |
| [Fixed Asset - Acquisition List](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5608) |  List all assets acquired within a given date range. You can also include fixed assets that are created but not yet acquired. |5608 |
| [Fixed Asset Details](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5604)| Shows the fixed asset ledger entries for fixed assets. |5604 |
| [Fixed Asset Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5600)| An analysis report where you can specify two date columns and three data columns to see in the report. For example, to generate a report to use for reconciling with the general ledger, add columns for acquisition cost at ending date, depreciation at ending date, and book value at ending date. A check report could have acquisitions/net change, write-down/net change, and Appreciation/net change, so every change to fixed asset can be checked if necessary. If you select the **Budget Report** field and specify an ending date in the future, the report will calculate the future depreciation and can give estimates for future depreciation and book values, if you selected those fields as report columns. |5600|
| [Fixed Asset Projected Value](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5607)| Shows the projected depreciation amounts and book value for a future period for assets. The report is useful when you are using different depreciation methods for your assets and want to estimate next year's depreciation, for example. Use the report to create the budget amounts for depreciation by selecting a budget and the **Copy to G/L Budget** field. |5607 |
| [Fixed Asset Book Value 01](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5605)|Shows detailed information about acquisition cost, depreciation value, and book value for both individual assets and groups of assets. For each of these three amount types, amounts are calculated at the beginning and at the end of a specified period and for the period itself. If you select the **Budget Report** field, the report will calculate the expected depreciation for the period. Enter a *group type* if you want the report to group the fixed assets and print group totals. For example, if you have set up six FA classes, select the *FA Class* option to have group totals printed for each of the six class codes.|5605|
| [Fixed Asset Book Value 02](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5606)|Shows the breakdown of fixed asset book value by changes in acquisition, depreciation, and appreciation within the period with a further breakdown by additions and disposals within the period. Use this report to describe the changes in fixed assets for a given period when many different changes occur across the grouping of fixed assets. If you select the **Budget Report** field, the report will calculate the expected depreciation for the period. Enter a *group type* if you want the report to group the fixed assets and print group totals. For example, if you have set up six FA classes, select the *FA Class* option to have group totals printed for each of the six class codes. |5606|
| [Fixed Asset G/L Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5610)|Shows an analysis of your fixed assets (FA) with various types of data for individual assets and/or groups of assets. On the Fixed Assets FastTab, you can set filters if you want the report to include only certain fixed assets. On the Options FastTab, tailor the report to meet your specific needs. The report is similar to the **Fixed Asset Analysis** report, but specifically for reconciling to the general ledger and specifically for validating the disposal entries. The report assumes that you know the G/L accounts that are specified in the  posting setup. | 5610 |
| [Fixed Asset Register](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5603) |Shows posted fixed asset ledger entries that are sorted and divided by register number. You can determine which registers' entries are shown by setting a filter. It is important to set a filter; otherwise, the report may show a very large amount of information. |5603  |

Security groups are new to Business Central in 2023 release wave 1. They're similar to the user groups that this article mentions. Like user groups, administrators assign the permissions to the security group that its members need to do their jobs.

User groups will no longer be available in a future release. You can continue using user groups to manage permissions until then. To learn more about security groups, go to [Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups](../ui-security-groups.md).

When you receive an invoice from a company in a foreign currency, it is fairly easy to calculate the local currency (LCY) value of the invoice based on today's currency rate. However, the invoice often comes with payment terms so you can delay the payment to a later date, which implies a potentially different currency rate. This issue in combination with the fact that bank currency rates always differ from the official currency rates makes it impossible to anticipate the exact local currency (LCY) amount that is required to cover the invoice. If the due date of the invoice extends to the next month, you might also have to revaluate the local currency (LCY) amount at the end of the month. The currency adjustment is necessary because the new LCY value that is required to cover the invoice amount might be different, and the company debt to the vendor has potentially changed. The new LCY amount might be higher or lower than the previous amount and will therefore represent a gain or a loss. However, since the invoice has not been paid yet, the gain or loss is considered *unrealized*. Later, the invoice is paid, and the bank has returned with the actual currency rate for the payment. It is not until now the *realized* gain or loss is calculated. This unrealized gain or loss is then reversed, and the realized gain or loss is posted instead.

In the following example, an invoice is received on January 1 with the currency amount of 1000. At the time, the currency rate is 1.123.

|Date|Action|Currency Amount|Document Rate|LCY Amount on document|Adjustment Rate|Unrealized Gains Amount|Payment Rate|Realized Losses Amount|  
|-----|----------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
|1/1|**Invoice**|1000|1.123|1123|||||
|1/31|**Adjustment**|1000||1125|1.125|2|||
|2/15|**Adjustment Reversal on payment**|1000||||-2|||
|2/15|**Payment**|1000||1120|||1.120|-3|

At the end of the month, a currency adjustment is performed where the adjustment currency rate has been set to 1.125, which triggers an unrealized gain of 2.

At the time of payment, the actual currency rate registered on the bank transaction shows a currency rate of 1.120.

Here there is an unrealized transaction, and therefore it will be reversed together with the payment.

Finally, the payment is registered and the actual loss is posted to the realized losses account.

Some apps are provided by Microsoft, and other apps are provided by other companies. 

We recommend that you access the links that are provided with each extension to learn more about the app before you choose to install it.

When you install an app, that app may have different test, compliance and security standards than Dynamics 365 Business Central. For example, some apps may:

- contact other online services
- process or store data outside of your organization’s selected geographic region and compliance boundary
- share data with third parties
- include functionality that is powered by AI
- include content or link to content that is not within your organization’s policies
- display UI that doesn't meet your organizations’ accessibility standards

The contents of the apps you install, such as new fields, pages, sample data, and links to online websites, may influence or be used by other features in Business Central. For example, the accuracy and user experience of Business Central’s AI-powered features might vary based on the apps that you have installed.

Installed apps may also influence other aspects of the user experience, such as performance or UI language.end of article

On sales documents and journals, you can specify a document number that refers to the customer's numbering system. <!--You can enter a maximum of ten characters, both numbers and letters.--> Use this field to record the number that the customer assigned to the order, invoice, or credit memo. You can then use the number later if, for some reason, you need to search for the posted entry using this number.  

The **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page specifies whether it is mandatory to enter an external document number in the **External Document No.** field on a sales header and the **External Document No.** field on a general journal line.

If you select this field, it will not be possible to post an invoice or a general journal line without an external document number.

The external document number is included in posted documents where you can search by the relevant number. You can also search using the external document number when navigating on customer ledger entries.

A different way to handle external document numbers is to use the **Your Reference** field. If you use the **Your Reference** field, the number will be included in posted documents, and you can search by it in the same way as for values from **External Document No.** fields. But the field is not available on journal lines.

When you set up users for approval workflows, it's important that the same user isn't both a requestor and an approver in a workflow user group. When a user is both a requestor and an approver, approvals work for them as follows:

* Their requests are always approved automatically.
* If there are multiple approvers, only the approvers with a higher sequence number in the workflow user group can change the status of a request to Approved. Approvers with a lower sequence number can approve requests, however, their approvals won't affect the status of a request.end of article

Shows amounts for sales, profit, invoice discount, and payment discount in LCY, and the profit percentage for each customer. The costs and profits are given as both the original and adjusted amounts. The original costs and profits are those values that were calculated at the time of posting, and the adjusted costs and profits reflect changes to the original costs of the items in the sales. The cost adjustment amount shown in the report is the difference between the original cost and the adjusted cost.<br>The figures are divided into three periods. You can select the length of the period, starting on a selected date. There are also columns for amounts before and after the three periods. Use the report to analyze earnings from an individual customer and earnings trends, for example.<br>In the US, Canada, and Mexico, this report is not available.

`https://<your Microsoft 365 tenant name>-my.sharepoint.com/personal/<your user name>`

For example, `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rsimone_contoso_onmicrosoft_com`.

You don't need the entire URL. You only use the portion before `/personal`:

`https://<your Microsoft 365 tenant name>-my.sharepoint.com`

For example,  `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com`.  

There are other ways to get the URL as well. For more information, see [OneDrive URLs for users in your organization](/onedrive/list-onedrive-urls) in the OneDrive documentation.end of article

After you've added all the items on lines you can calculate the invoice discount for the entire sales document by choosing the **Calculate Invoice Discount** action.

The discount is calculated based on all lines on the sales document where the **Allow Invoice Disc.** checkbox is chosen. By default, invoice discounts are allowed. However, lines with item charges, for example, are not included in the calculation of the invoice discount. To apply a discount to such lines, enter a value in the **Line Discount Amount** field on the lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Allow Invoice Disc.** and **Line Discount Amount** fields are hidden on lines. If the fields aren't available, you can add them by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](../ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

> [!TIP]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** field is selected in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount is calculated automatically. When the calculation happens differs, depending on the type of sales document you're using.
>
> If you're using a sales order, the discount is calculated when you add a line. For all other sales documents, such as sales invoices, the discount is calculated when you do any of the following actions:
>
> * View statistics
> * View a test report
> * Print
> * Post

You define invoice discount terms for a customer on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page. The currency code on the sales document is used to find the invoice discount terms in the corresponding currency.

If you haven't defined invoice discounts for foreign currencies, the discount terms on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page are used to calculate the discount. The calculation uses your local currency and the exchange rate that was valid on the document's posting date.

If your company operates in more than one country or region, it's probably important that you can do business in more than one currency. You define your local currency (LCY) on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Afterward, your local currency will be represented as a blank currency on documents and transactions. When the **Currency** field is blank, the currency is LCY.

The following video explains how to set up your local currency.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=d1008bb9-c45d-439a-8ce7-f30f5f655f42]

Next, you must set up currency codes for each currency that you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency (LCY). Also bank accounts can be created using currencies. It is possible to record G/L transactions in different currencies, however, the G/L transaction will always be posted in the local currency (LCY).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-lcy](finance-currencies-lcy-note.md)]

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a currency exchange rate assigned. By designating a second currency as an additional reporting currency, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and the additional reporting currency on G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](../finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md). The additional reporting currency is most often used to facilitate financial reporting to owners that reside in countries/regions using different currencies than the local currency (LCY).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use an additional reporting currency for financial reporting, make sure that you understand the limitations. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](../finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> When you post to the general ledger using a foreign currency, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] converts the transaction to LCY using the currency exchange rate for the posting date. The G/L entry won't contain information about which currency was used, only its value in LCY. To keep track of the original currency, use the sales and purchase documents and bank accounts that store currency information for entries.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] users sometimes support more than one department or suborganization within a business unit. For example, a business might have sales offices in different cities and multiple countries/regions, so it has created a separate business unit for each office. The offices that are in the same country/region are set up as separate *companies* in a shared *environment*. Other offices are created as companies in separate environments because they are geographically based in other countries/regions.

- What's a company?

  Think of a *company* as a container that holds information about a legal entity. Using the example above, the business has a sales office in Seattle and another in New York, so it creates a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] for each office so that it can manage operations for each office separately.

- What's an environment?

  Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online exist in what are referred to as *environments*. There are two types of environments, **Production** and **Sandbox**. In short, production environments contain live business data, and sandbox environments are used as a safe place to test things like new business processes or features. For more information, see [Types of environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#types-of-environments) (in English only). If you have access to a company, you have access to the environment it's in. If you have access to more than one company, and those companies are in different environments, when you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] you must specify the environment that you want to work in. Environments are particular to a given country/region, so if your organization works in multiple countries/regions, you need separate environments for each country/region. For more information, see [Environments and companies](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology#environments-and-companies) (in English only).
