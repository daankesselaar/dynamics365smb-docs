# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

In the **Help and Support** page, you can see the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that your company is based on. If you want to base a company on a different version, your administrator can create a new production environment. For more information, see [Create a new production environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-production-environment) in the developer- and IT Pro content.  

## Languages of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help

The Help content for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] publishes to Microsoft Learn. The content is available in different languages. If you access the documentation while you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the content displays in your language. By default, if a particular page isn't available in your language yet, it shows in English.

### How do I change the language of the Microsoft Learn site?

Scroll to the bottom of the browser page and choose the globe symbol in the bottom left corner.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list shows all languages that are supported by the Microsoft Learn site. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in a limited number of countries/regions, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help content is not available in all languages that the Microsoft Learn site supports.

# Income Statement by Month (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Income Statement by Month** report provides a detailed, month-to-month view of net changes across all income statement accounts, organized in a hierarchy for intuitive navigation. You can explore specific details by drilling down to the **Income Statement Drill-Through** report, which provides access to the underlying ledger entries.

This report is for senior management and finance administrators, offering a profit and loss overview that supports financial analysis, performance tracking, and informed decision-making.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Income Statement by Month report" lightbox="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png":::

## Use the report

CFOs use the report to analyze monthly profitability trends for the fiscal year. For example, you might review the month-to-month changes in both operating expenses and revenue to identify drivers in overall profitability.

Finance administrators use the report to manage and review the operating expenses by a Department dimension. For example, if you spot an unexpected rise in costs, you could filter the report by department to identify the department responsible for the increased expenditure. This information can help you investigate and realign the department budget, if needed.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Net Change**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#net-change)

# Fulfilling Service Contracts 
One way to set up a service management business is to have standard contractual agreements between you and your customers that describe the level of service and the service expectations. You can create contract templates that include necessary information, such as customer, start date of contract, and invoice period.  
  
After you set up the template, you can customize the resulting contract to keep track of service hours, or other items that may vary from customer to customer. You can also set up a contract manually from a service contract quote. Finally, you can adjust your service pricing to keep track of discounts that a specific customer qualifies for, by specifying the discount amount on the **Service Contract** page.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox

The intercompany transactions that you receive from your partners are listed on the **Intercompany Inbox** page. To learn how to process incoming intercompany transactions, go to [Process incoming intercompany transactions](#process-incoming-intercompany-transactions). The intercompany transactions that you send to partners are listed on the **Intercompany Outbox** page. To learn how to process outgoing intercompany transactions, go to [To process outgoing intercompany transactions](#to-process-outgoing-intercompany-transactions).

However, depending on your intercompany setup, some transactions are automatically handled. You can set up the source company and partner companies to automatically create documents and journals that correspond to transactions that partners post through the intercompany general journal. To learn about using intercompany journals, go to [Fill in and post an intercompany journal](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md#fill-in-and-post-an-intercompany-journal).  

## Organizing the Inbox  

You can use the filter fields at the top of the Inbox page to determine which transactions are shown on the page. For example, if you only want to explore transactions that a particular partner created, use the **Transaction Source** and **Intercompany Partner Code** filters.  

### Transaction source  

What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was:  

* Created by your intercompany partner  
* Rejected by your intercompany partner and returned to you  

Use the **Show Transaction Source** field to filter the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page so that it displays only one of these types of transactions. You can also filter by intercompany partner, or by the contents of the **Line Action** field.  

#### Created by intercompany partner  

 When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner, you can choose to either:

* Accept the transaction  
* Reject the transaction (return to partner)  
* Cancel the transaction (delete the transaction and don't return it to your partner)  

#### Returned from intercompany partner  

If your intercompany partner rejects a transaction, you must cancel the transaction in the inbox and then create correction lines or reverse the journal or document.  

## Recreating inbox entries  

If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

## Get an overview of intercompany transactions for a period  

You can get an overview of all of the intercompany transactions that you have sent and received in a period. The **Intercompany Transactions** report lists all intercompany G/L entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the intercompany partners are in the same database, the partners can automatically accept transactions. The go directly to the **Handled Intercompany Inbox Transactions** and **Handled Intercompany Outbox Transactions** pages. To learn more about auto-accepting transactions, go to [Auto-accept transactions from intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).  
>
> * For the synchronization partner, on the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle.
> * For partner companies, on the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto. Accept Transactions** toggle.  

## Import intercompany transactions from a file

[!INCLUDE [onprem_only_md](includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company, you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file. Then you must import the transactions into your inbox.  

1. Save the file to the location that you specified in the **Intercompany Inbox Details** field when you set up intercompany.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, choose the **Import Transaction File** action.  
4. on the page that appears, select the .xml file that contains the transactions, and then choose the **Open** button.  

The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them.

## Process incoming intercompany transactions (using the inbox) 

When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions, the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox. You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act on it.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Accept**, to process the line.
3. On the **Complete IC Inbox Action** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

For lines that you accept, document or journal lines are created in your company. Open each document or journal, make any necessary changes, and then post them.  

Lines that you reject and return to your partner go to your intercompany outbox, where you can send them to your partner.

For lines that a partner rejected and returned to you, you must post a correction to the original transaction that you posted in your company.

## To process outgoing intercompany transactions (using the outbox) 

When you post an intercompany journal or document, or send an intercompany order confirmation, the transactions go to your intercompany outbox. To send them to your intercompany partners, open the outbox and process them.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Outbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Return to Inbox**, to process the line.

Use the **Send to Intercompany Partner** action to send lines to the relevant partner's inbox.

Use the **Return to Inbox** action to move lines to your inbox, where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company.  

If you use the **Cancel** action, you must post a correction to the transaction that you originally posted in your company.  

## Recreate intercompany inbox or outbox transactions  

You might want to re-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox. For example, if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

The following procedure describes to re-create inbox transactions, but the same steps also apply to the outbox.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Handled IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Handled IC Inbox Transactions** page, select the line with the transaction that you want to re-create in the inbox, and then choose the **Re-create Inbox Transaction** action.

# Create incoming document records

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

To record an external document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], first create or complete an incoming document record. You can do those tasks manually, or you can take a photo of the external document to create the incoming document record with the image file attached.

Before you can use the **Incoming Documents** feature, you must perform the required setup. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

## Approve or reject an incoming document

If you have set up the **Incoming Documents** feature to require approval to create documents, users with the appropriate rights must approve the records before they're processed. For more information, see [Set up approvers of incoming document records](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the document that you want to approve or reject, and then choose the **Approve** or **Reject** actions.

If you approve the incoming document record, the **Released** check box on the incoming document line is selected. The user in charge of creating, for example, purchase invoices can proceed to process the record.

# Design Details: Integration with Inventory

Warehouse management and inventory features interact with one another in physical inventory and in inventory or warehouse adjustment.  

## Physical inventory  

The **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page is used with the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page for all advanced warehouse locations. The inventory on bin level is calculated, and a printed list is provided for the warehouse employee. The list shows which items in which bins must be counted.  
  
The warehouse employee enters the counted quantity on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page and then posts the journal.  
  
If the counted quantity is greater than the quantity on the journal line, a movement is posted for this difference from the default adjustment bin to the counted bin. This increases the quantity in the counted bin and decreases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
If the quantity counted is less than the quantity on the journal line, a movement for this difference is posted from the counted bin to the default adjustment bin. This decreases the quantity in the counted bin and increases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
In advanced warehouse configurations, the value in the **Quantity (Calculated)** field is retrieved from item ledger entries and the value in the **Quantity (Phys. Inventory)** field is retrieved from warehouse entries, excluding the adjustment bin content. The **Quantity** field specifies the difference between the first two fields, which should be equal to the contents of the adjustment bin.  
  
When you post the physical inventory journal, the inventory and the default adjustment bin are updated.  

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]
  
## Warehouse adjustments to the item ledger  

You use the **Item Journal** page and the **Calculate Whse. Adjustment** function to adjust inventory on the item ledger in accordance with an adjustment that has been made to the item quantity in a warehouse bin. To create a link between the inventory and the warehouse, you must define a default adjustment bin per location.  
  
The default adjustment bin registers items in the warehouse when you post an increase for the inventory. However, if you post a decrease, the quantity on the default bin is also decreased. In both cases, item ledger entries and warehouse entries are created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Inventory calculations don't include the adjustment bin.  
  
To adjust the bin content, use a warehouse item journal, where you can enter the item number, zone code, bin code, and quantity to adjust.  
  
If you enter a positive quantity and post the line, then the inventory stored in the bin increases, and the quantity of the default adjustment bin decreases correspondingly.

# Set up data exchange definitions

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to exchange data in specific tables with data on external files. For example to send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll, and item catalogs. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

To create a data exchange definition for a data file or stream, you can use the related XML schema to define which data elements to include on the **Column Definitions** FastTab. See step 6 in [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#to-describe-the-formatting-of-lines-and-columns-in-the-file). Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Normally, you set up data exchange definitions on the **Data Exchange Definition** page. However, for updating currency exchange rates, it's faster to use a currency exchange rate service. Learn more at [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the file that is being converted is in the XML format, the term *"column"* in this article should be interpreted as an *"XML element containing data"*.  

This article includes the following procedures:  

* Create a data exchange definition.
* Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others.
* Import an XML file for an existing data exchange definition.

## Create a data exchange definition

Creating a data exchange definition involves two tasks:  

1. On the **Data Exchange Definition** page, describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file. Learn more in the [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](#formatlinescolumns) section.  
2. On the **Data Exchange Mapping** page, map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](#mapfields) section.  

### <a name=formatlinescolumns></a>To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, describe the data exchange definition and the data file type by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Definition|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the data exchange definition.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the data exchange definition.|  
    |**File Type**|Specify what type of file the data exchange definition is used for. You can select between four file types:<br /><br /> -   **XML**: Layered strings of content and markup surrounded by tags indicating function.<br />-   **Variable Text**: Records have variable length and are separated by a character, such as a comma or semi\-colon, also known as *delimited file*.<br />-   **Fixed Text**: Records have the same length, using pad characters, and each record is on a separate line, also known as *fixed-width file*.<br />- **Json**: Layered strings of content in JavaScript.|  
    |**Type**|Specify what type of business activity the data exchange definition is used for, such as **Payment Export**.|  
    |**Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers data in and out of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Validation Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to validate data against predefined business rules.|  
    |**Reading/Writing Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that processes imported data before mapping and the exported data afterward.|  
    |**Reading/Writing XMLport**|Specify the XMLport through which an imported data file or service enters before mapping, and through which exported data is written to a data file or service afterward.|  
    |**Ext. Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers external data in and out of the data exchange framework.|  
    |**User Feedback Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that does various clean-up after mapping, such as marks the lines as exported and deletes temporary records.|  
    |**File Encoding**|Specify the encoding of the file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Column Separator**|Specify how columns in the data file are separated, if the file is of type **Variable Text**.|  
    |**Header Lines**|Specify how many header lines exist in the file.<br /><br /> This setting makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Header Tag**|If a header line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the header line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Footer Tag**|If a footer line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the footer line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the footer data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  

   > [!TIP]
   > To see which codeunits Microsoft uses in existing definitions in the standard product, review the three **Codeunit** fields on the **Field Mapping** page, under the **General** FastTab, for each definition.  

4. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, describe the formatting of lines in the data file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For import of bank statements, you only create one line for the single format of the bank statement file that you want to import.  
    >
    > For export of payments, you can create a line for each payment type that you want to export. In that case, the **Column Definitions** FastTab shows different columns for each payment type.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Line Type**|Specifies the type of the line in the file.|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the line in the file.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name that describes the line in the file.|  
    |**Column Count**|Specify how many columns the line in the data file has. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Data Line Tag**|Specify the position in the related XML schema of the element that represents the main entry of the data file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Namespace**|Specify the namespace that's expected in the file to enable namespace validation. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to enable namespace validation.|  
    |**Parent Code**|Specify the line's parent, as displayed in the **Code** field in cases where the data exchange setup is for files with parent and children entries, such as a document header and lines.

5. Repeat step 4 to create a line for every type of file data that you want to export.  

     Proceed to describe the formatting of columns in the data file by filling the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab as described in the table in step 8. You can use a structure file, such as an .xsd file, for the data file to prefill the FastTab with the relevant elements. Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).

6. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, choose the **Get File Structure** action.  
7. On the **Get File Structure** page, select the related structure file, then choose **OK**. The lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab are filled according to the structure of the data file.  
8. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, edit or fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Column No.**|Specify the number that reflects the column's position on the line in the file.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the number that reflects the type of element in the file that contains the data.|  
    |**Name**|Specify the name of the column.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the markup that marks the data to be exchanged.|  
    |**Data Type**|Specify if the data to be exchanged is of type **Text**, **Date**, or **Decimal**.|  
    |**Data Format**|Specify the format of the data, if any. For example, **MM-dd-yyyy** if the data type is **Date**. **Note:** For export, specify the data format according to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For import, specify the data format according to the .NET Framework. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).|  
    |**Data Formatting Culture**|Specify the regional data format, if any. For example, **en-US** if the data type is **Decimal** to make sure that comma is used as the 0.000 separator, according to the US format. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings). **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Length**|Specify the length of the fixed-width line that holds the column if the data file is of type **Fixed Text**.|  
    |**Description**|Specifies a description of the column, for informational purposes.|  
    |**Path**|Specify the position of the element in the related XML schema.|  
    |**Negative-Sign Identifier**|Enter the value that is used in the data file to identify negative amounts, in data files that can't contain negative signs. This identifier is then used to reverse the identified amounts to negative signs during import. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Constant**|Specify any data that you want to export in this column, such as extra information about the payment type. **Note:** This field is only relevant for export.|  
    |**Text Padding Required**|Specify that the data must include text padding.|  
    |**Pad Character**|Specify the text padding character.|  
    |**Justification**|Specify if the column justification is left or right.|  

9. Repeat step 8 for every column or XML element in the data file that has data that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The next step in creating a data exchange definition is to decide which columns or XML elements in the data file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> The specific mapping depends on the business purpose of the data file to be exchanged and on local variations. Even the SEPA bank standard has local variations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import of SEPA CAMT bank statement files out\-of\-the\-box. This is represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition record code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page. For information about the specific field mapping of this SEPA CAMT support, see [Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files](across-field-mapping-when-importing-sepa-camt-files.md).  

### <a name=mapfields></a>To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in one business app the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in another it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you exchange data. This happens through transformation rules that you define for the fields. Learn more at [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

You can also group by any field, use the key index to sort results, and the new transformation types **Rounding** and **Field Lookup**.

1. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select the line for which you want to map columns to fields, then choose **Field Mapping**. The **Data Exchange Mapping** page opens.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, specify the mapping setup by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table ID**|Specify the table that holds the fields to or from which data is exchanged according to the mapping.|  
    |**Use as Intermediate Table**|Specify if the table that you select in the **Table ID** field is an intermediate table where the imported data is stored before it's mapped to the target table.<br/><br/> You typically use an intermediate table when the data exchange definition imports and converts electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, documents such as vendor invoices into purchase invoices. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the mapping setup.|  
    |**Key Index**|Specify the key index to sort the source records before exporting.|
    |**Pre-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that prepares the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data.|  
    |**Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to map the specified columns or XML data elements to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Post-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that completes the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data. **Note:**  When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension feature, the codeunit converts exported data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a generic format that's ready for export. For import, the codeunit converts external data to a format that is ready for import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
3. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, specify which columns map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by filling the fields as described in the following tables, depending on whether the **Use as Intermediate Table** field was enabled or not.  
   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle off:

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field ID**|Specify which field the column in the **Column No.** field maps to.<br /><br /> You can only select from fields that exist in the table that you specified in the **Table ID** field on the **General** FastTab.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Optional**|Specify if the map should be skipped if the field is empty. If you don't select this option, then an export error occurs if the field is empty.|  
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about how to apply transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Overwrite Value**|Specify that the new value can overwrite the current value.|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|
     |**Multiplier**|Specify a multiplier to be applied on numeric data, including negative values.|

   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle enabled:

     |Field|Description|  
     |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Table ID**|Specify the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Table Caption**|Specify the name of the table in the **Target Table ID** field, which is the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Field ID**|Specify the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the name of the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Validate Only**|Specify that the element-to-field map isn't used to convert data, but only to validate data.|
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|

4. On the **Field Grouping** FastTab, specify rules you want to use to group your fields when you create the file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Field ID**|Specify the number of the field in the external file that is used for grouping, and that the user must set this field.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is used for grouping.|

## Transformation Rules

If the values in the fields you're mapping differ, you must use transformation rules for data exchange definitions to make them the same. You define transformation rules for data exchange definitions by opening an existing definition, or creating a new definition, and then on the **Line Definitions** FastTab, choosing **Manage**, and then **Field Mapping**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. The following table describes the types of transformations that you can perform.

|Option|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Uppercase**|Capitalize all letters.|
|**Lowercase**|Make all letters lowercase.|
|**Title Case**|Capitalize the first letter of each word.|
|**Trim**|Remove empty spaces before and after the value.|
|**Substring**|Transform a specific portion of a value. To specify where to start the transformation, choose either a **Start Position** or **Starting Text**. The starting position is a number that represents the first character to transform. The starting text is the letter immediately before the letter to replace. If you want to start with the first letter in the value, use a starting position instead. To specify where to stop the transformation, you choose either **Length**, which is the number of characters to replace, or the **Ending Text**, which is the character that is immediately after the last character to transform.|
|**Replace**|Find a value and replace it with another. This transformation is useful for replacing simple values, such as a particular word.|
|**Regular Expression - Replace**|Use a regular expression as part of a find and replace operation. This transformation is useful for replacing multiple, or more complex, values.|
|**Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters**|Delete characters that aren't letters or numbers, such as symbols or special characters.|
|**Date Formatting**|Specify how to display dates. For example, you can transform DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.|
|**Decimal Formatting**|Define rules for decimal placement and rounding precision.|
|**Regular Expression - Match**|Use a regular expression to find one or more values. This rule is similar to the **Substring** and **Regular Expression - Replace** options.|
|**Custom**|This transformation rule is an advanced option that requires assistance from a developer. It enables an integration event that you can subscribe to if you want to use your own transformation code. If you're a developer and want to use this option, go to [Tip for developers: Example of the custom option](#tip-for-developers-example-of-the-custom-option).|
|**Date and Time Formatting**|Define how to display the current date and the time of day.|
|**Field Lookup**|Use fields from different tables. To use it, you need to follow some rules. First, use **Table ID** to specify the ID of the table that contains the record for the field lookup. Then, in the **Source Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field that contains the record for the field lookup. Finally, in the **Target Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field to find the record for the field lookup. Optionally, use the **Field Lookup Rule** field to specify the type of the field lookup. For the **Target** field, the value from the **Target Field ID** is used, even if it's blank. For the **Original If Target Is Blank** field, the original value is used if the target is blank.|
|**Round**|Round the value in this field using some extra rules. First, in the **Precision** field, specify a rounding precision. Then, in the **Direction** field, specify the rounding direction.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Learn more about date and time formatting at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).

### Tip for developers: Example of the custom option

The following example shows how to implement your own transformation code.

```AL
codeunit 60100 "Hello World"
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::"Transformation Rule", 'OnTransformation', '', false, false)]
    procedure OnTransformation(TransformationCode: Code[20]; InputText: Text; var OutputText: Text)
    begin
        if TransformationCode = 'CUST' then
            OutputText := InputText + ' testing';
    end;
}
```

After you define your rules, you can test them. In the **Test** FastTab, enter an example of a value that you want to transform, then check the results by choosing **Update**.

## Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others

After you create the data exchange definition for a specific data file, you can export the data exchange definition as an XML file that you can import. This task is described in the following procedure.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the data exchange definition that you want to export.  
3. Choose the **Export Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  

    If a data exchange definition was already created, you just have to import the XML file into the Data Exchange Framework. This task is described in the following procedure.  

## Import an existing data exchange definition

1. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
3. Choose the **Import Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Choose the file that you saved in step 1.

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-80.00|-10|2|  

### Value Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|2|3|  

### Item Application Entries (2)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|2|2|1|2|-10|  

At the end of the accounting period, you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to reconcile these inventory transactions with the general ledger.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

 The following tables show the result of reconciling the inventory transactions in this example with the general ledger.  

### Value Entries (3)  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|10.00|1|2|

# Sales

You create a sales invoice or sales order to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.

You must use sales orders if your sales process requires you to ship parts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't available right away. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use sales orders. In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. With sales orders, you can also use the order promising functionality to communicate certain delivery dates to your customers.  

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice or sales order when you agree on the sale. After the customer confirms the agreement, you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed.

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the customer pays it. For example, to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo or a sales return order to reverse the sale.

Good sales and marketing practices are all about how to make the best decisions at the right time. Marketing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a precise and timely overview of your contact information so you can serve your prospective customers more efficiently and increase customer satisfaction. Learn more at [Relationship Management](marketing-relationship-management.md).

If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities. For example, to process orders, manage inventory, and do your finances. Learn more at [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

In business environments where the customer must pay before products are delivered, such as in retail, you must wait for the receipt of payment before you deliver the products. In most cases, you process incoming payments some weeks after delivery by applying the payments to their related posted, unpaid sales invoices. Learn more at [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Sales documents can be sent as PDF files attached to email. The email body contains an extract of the sales document, such as products, total amount, and a link to the PayPal site. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

For all sales processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow. For example, an approval workflow can require that a manager approves large sales to certain customers. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Period-Over-Period Growth (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period Growth** report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. The report compares sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, providing insight into growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the sales amount in September 2023 to the sales amount in September 2022. If the analysis scope is fiscal years, the report compares the sales amount in fiscal year 2023 to the sale amount in fiscal year 2022.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Previous Period**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pp-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop--fiscal)

# Set Up Locations to Use Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and you use them to suggest where to place items. After you create your bins you define their contents, or let them serve as floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location** card. After you turn on the toggle, the **Bin Code** and **Zone Code** fields are available on the following documents:

* Warehouse receipt header
* Warehouse receipt lines
* Warehouse put-away lines
* Warehouse shipment header
* Warehouse shipment lines
* Warehouse put-away lines

The next step is to design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in setup fields that represent the different flows.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must create bin codes before you can specify them for the location. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

## To set up a location to use bins

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use bins.  
3. Choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Bin Mandatory** checkbox.  
5. If you aren't using directed put-away and pick for the location, in the **Default Bin Selection** field, choose the method you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use to assign a default bin to an item.  
6. Open the card for the location that you want to set up bins for.
7. On the **Bins** FastTab, select the bins to use as the default for receipts, shipments, inbound, outbound, and open shop floor bins.  

    The bin codes you specify appear automatically on the headers and lines of various warehouse documents. The default bins define all starting or ending placements of items in the warehouse.  
8. If you're using directed put-away and pick, select a bin for warehouse adjustments. The bin code in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field defines the virtual bin in which to record discrepancies in inventory:

    * When you observe differences registered in the warehouse item journal
    * Differences calculated when you register a warehouse physical inventory  
9. Optional: Fill in the fields on the **Bin Policies** FastTab. The most important fields are **Bin Capacity Policy**, **Allow Breakbulk**, and **Put-away Template Code** fields.  
10. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, fill in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time**, **Inbound Whse. Handling Time**, and the **Base Calendar Code** fields. To learn more, go to [Set Up Base Calendars](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md).

## Fill in the consumption bin

The following flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled in according to your location setup.

# Create number series

For each company that you set up, you need to assign unique identification codes to things such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and other documents. Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

> [!Important]
> By default, gaps aren't allowed in number series because the exact history of financial transactions must be available for auditing, by law, and therefore must follow an unbroken sequence with no deleted numbers.
>
> If you want to allow gaps in certain number series, consult with your auditor or accounting manager to ensure that you adhere to the legal requirements in your country/region. For more information, see the [Gaps in Number Series](#gaps-in-number-series) section.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you use the same number series codes as you see listed on the **No. Series List** page in the CRONUS demonstration company. Codes such as *P-INV+* might not make immediate sense to you, but [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a number of default settings that depend on these number series codes.

You create a numbering system by setting up one or more codes for each type of master data or document. For example, you can set up one code for numbering customers, another code for numbering sales invoices, and another code for numbering documents in general journals. After you set up a code, you must set up at least one number series line. The number series line contains information such as the first and last number in the series and the starting date. You can set up more than one number series line per number series code, with a different starting date for each line. Number series are consecutive, starting each series on the respective starting date.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum length of a number in a number series is 20 characters. There are some situations where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will append a number with a system-generated ID. For example, when documents such as invoices are used to apply transactions, such as payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates identifiers for the applied transactions. The identifier is comprised of a number from a number series and a six character system-assigned ID, such as -12345. If you expect to process more than 9999 documents in bank or GIRO journals, or cash receipt journals, set up number series for those types of documents to include fewer than 14 characters.

You typically set up your number series to automatically insert the next consecutive number on new cards or documents that you create. However, you can also set up a number series to allow you to manually enter a number. To manually enter numbers, turn on the **Manual Nos.** toggle.

If you want to use more than one number series code for one type of master data - for example, if you want to use different number series for different categories of items - you can use number series relationships.

## Get assistance from Copilot

The suggest number series with Copilot feature can help administrators create and maintain number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language. To learn more about this AI-based capability, go to [Suggest number series with Copilot](suggest-number-series-copilot.md).

## Gaps in number series

Not all records that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are financial transactions that must use sequential numbering. For example, you assign number series to customers, sales quotes, and warehouse activities, but they aren't subject to financial auditing and can be deleted. For such number series, you can select the **Allow Gaps in Nos.** checkbox on the **No. Series Lines** page. This setting can also be changed after creating the number series. For more information, see [To create a new number series](ui-create-number-series.md#to-create-a-new-number-series).

## Behavior of the No. field on documents and cards

On sales, purchase, transfer, and service documents, and on all cards, the **No.** field can be filled in automatically from a predefined number series, or you can add it manually. <!--However, under certain circumstances, the **No.** field is invisible to prevent you from editing it.-->

The **No.** field can be filled in three ways:

1. If only one number series for the type of document or card exists, and the **Default Nos.** field is selected and the **Manual Nos.** field isn't selected for that number series, then the field is automatically filled with the next number in the series.<!-- The **No.** field doesn't display on the card or document.-->  

    <!--Even if you define templates with various number series for customers, if the number series that is defined in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page is set up in this way, the **No.** field doesn't display on the customer card, no matter which template you use. The same applies to other types of cards and documents.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the number series isn't working, for example because it's reached the last number defined for its range, the **No.** field displays so you can manually enter a number. You can resolve issues on the **No. Series** page.-->

2. If you have more than one number series for a type of document or card, and the **Default Nos.** checkbox isn't selected for the assigned number series, the **No.** field displays, and you can go to the **No. Series** page and select the number series you want to use. The next number in the series is then inserted in the **No.** field.

3. If you don't have a number series for a type of document or card, or if the **Manual Nos.** field is selected for the number series, the **No.** field displays and you must enter a number manually. You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.

When you open a new document or card that a number series exists for, the **No. Series Setup** page opens so that you can set up a number series for that type of document or card and continue working.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to enable manual numbering on, for example, new item cards that were created with a data migration process that has hidden the **No.** by default, go to the **Inventory Setup** page and choose the **Item Nos.** field to open and set the related number series to **Manual Nos.**.
>
> The same is true if you're using service management features. To resolve that issue, go to the **Service Management Setup** page and choose the **Service Item Nos.** field to set the number series to **Manual Nos.**.

## To create a new number series

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **Lines** action.  
5. On the **No. Series Lines** page, fill in the fields to define the actual use and content of the number series that you created in step 2.  
6. Repeat step 5 for as many different uses of the number series that you need. The **Starting Date** field defines which number series line is active.  

> [!TIP]
> To allow users to specify numbers manually when they register a new customer or vendor, for example, choose the **Manual Nos.** field on the number series itself. To prevent manual numbering, clear the field.

You can assign number series to the templates that you set up for the different types of customers and vendors that your sales people and purchasers most often add. In that case, set up the relevant number series, link them through relationships, and then add the first number series in the relevant relationship to the relevant setup page. Then, when a user creates a customer, they choose the relevant template, and the new customer gets a number assigned from the number series that is defined for that template.  

## To create relationships between number series

If you set up more than one number series for the same kind of information or transactions, you can create relationships between the series. This feature can help you decide among the codes when you use a number. When you set up a relationship between a group of number series, you associate all of the related series to one number series. Then, you can enter that code in a field on the **Numbering** FastTab on setup pages, such as **Sales & Receivables Setup**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the number series you want to create relationships for and then choose **Relationships**.
3. In the **Series Code** field, enter the code for the number series that you want to relate to the series you selected in step 2.
4. Add a line for each code that you want to relate to the selected number series.
5. Close the page.

Now when you set up something that requires a number, you can use the relationships you created to select among the related number series.

## To set up where a number series is used

The following procedure shows how to set up number series for the Sales area. The steps are similar for other areas.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, select the desired number series for each sales card or document.

The selected number now fills in the **No.** field on the card or document according to your settings.

# Bin Contents (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Bin Contents** report breaks down an organization's inventory levels on a bin-by-bin basis. Use this information to identify high and low volume bins and inform inventory movement requirements if bins need more inventory.

The report also shows the available quantity and quantity metrics across different warehouse activities. For example, picks, put-aways, and general adjustments.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/bin-contents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Bin Contents Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/bin-contents.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps managers and manufacturing or procurement staff to identify item volumes in each bin.

For warehouse or inventory managers, the report provides a clear picture of the stock levels of each bin across your organization. The report can help you make decisions on procurement or production. It might also prompt you to transfer stock to a specific bin to maintain supply.

Manufacturing team members can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan production schedules based on the inventory in each bin.

The procurement team can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan purchase orders to ensure that quantities in bins stay at a reasonable level.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Bin Contents* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity in Adjustment Bin**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity-in-adjustment-bin)

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

# Design details: Handling reordering policies

To include an item in supply planning, you must specify a reordering policy for it on the **Item Card** page. The following reordering policies are available:  

* Fixed Reorder Qty.  
* Maximum Qty.  
* Order  
* Lot-for-Lot  

The **Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.** policies relate to inventory planning. These policies coexist with the step-by-step balancing of supply and order tracking.  

## The role of the reorder point

A reorder point represents demand during lead time. When inventory is projected to pass below the level defined by the reorder point, it's time to order more. Inventory decreases gradually until the replenishment arrives. It might reach zero or the safety stock level. The planning system suggests a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the inventory passes below the reorder point.  

Inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket. Therefore, the planning system constantly monitors available inventory.

## Monitoring the projected inventory level and the reorder point

Inventory is a type of supply, but for inventory planning, the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels:  

* Projected inventory  
* Projected available inventory  

### Projected inventory  

At the start of the planning process, projected inventory is the gross quantity of inventory. The gross quantity includes posted and unposted supply and demand in the past. This quantity becomes a projected inventory level that gross quantities from future supply and demand maintain. Future supply and demand are introduced along the time line, whether reserved or allocated in other ways.  

The planning system uses projected inventory to monitor the reorder point and determine the reorder quantity using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

### Projected available inventory  

Projected available inventory is the inventory that is available to fulfill demand at a given point in time. The planning system uses projected available inventory when monitoring the safety stock level. Safety stock must always be available for unexpected demand.  

### Time buckets  

Projected inventory is important detecting when the reorder point is reached or crossed, and to calculate the right order quantity when using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

The projected inventory level is calculated at the start of the planning period. It's a gross level that doesn't consider reservations or other allocations. To monitor this inventory level during the planning sequence, the planning system monitors the aggregated changes over a period of time. That period is called a *time bucket*. To learn more about time buckets, go to [The role of the time bucket](#the-role-of-the-time-bucket). The planning system ensures that the time bucket is at least one day. One day is the minimum unit of time for demand or supply events.  

### Determining the projected inventory level  

The following sequence describes how the planning system determines the projected inventory level:  

* When a supply event is fully planned, such as a purchase order, it increases the projected inventory on the event's due date.  
* When a demand event is fully satisfied, it doesn't decrease the projected inventory right away. Instead, it posts a decrease reminder, which is an internal record that holds the date and quantity of the addition to projected inventory.  
* When a later supply event is planned and added to the timeline, the system investigates posted decrease reminders one by one to the planned date of the supply. During this process, the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder might be reached or crossed.  
* When a new supply order is introduced, it checks whether it was entered before the current supply. If it is, the new supply becomes current supply and the balancing procedure restarts.  

The following image shows this principle.  

![Determining the Projected Inventory Level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_projected_inventory.png "Determining the Projected Inventory Level")  

1. Supply **Sa** of 4 (fixed) closes Demand **Da** of -3.  
2. CloseDemand: Create a decrease reminder of -3 (not shown).  
3. Supply **Sa** is closed with a surplus of 1 (there isn't more demand).  

     The projected inventory level increases to +4, while the projected **available** inventory becomes -1.  

4. The next supply **Sb** of 2 (another order) is already placed on the timeline.  
5. The planning system checks for a decrease reminder before **Sb** (in this example there isn't, so no action is taken).  
6. The planning system closes supply **Sb** (no more demand exists) by either A, reducing it to 0 (cancel) or B, by leaving it as is.  

     The projected inventory level increases (A: +0 => +4 or B: +2 = +6).  

7. The planning system makes a final check. Is there any decrease reminder? Yes, there's one on the date of **Da**.  
8. The planning system adds the decrease reminder of -3 reminder to the projected inventory level, either A: +4 -3 = 1 or B: +6 -3 = +3.  
9. For A, the planning system creates a forward-scheduled order starting on date **Da**. For B, the reorder point is reached and a new order is created.

## The role of the time bucket

The purpose of the time bucket is to collect demand events within a time period in order to make a joint supply order.  

For reordering policies that use a reorder point, you can define a time bucket. Time buckets help ensure that demands within the same time period are accumulated. The system then checks the effect on projected inventory and whether the reorder point is passed.

If you pass the reorder point, the system forward schedules a new supply order from the end of the time bucket. Time buckets begin on the planning starting date.  

The time bucket concept reflects the manual process of checking the inventory level on a frequent basis rather than for each transaction. You define the frequency (the time bucket). For example, you might gather all item needs from a vendor to place a weekly order.  

![Example of time bucket in planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_reorder_cycle.png "Example of time bucket in planning")  

Time buckets are often used to avoid a cascade effect. For example, a balanced row of demand and supply where an early demand is canceled, or a new one is created. The result would be that every supply order (except the last one) is rescheduled.

## Stay below the overflow level

When using the **Maximum Qty.** and **Fixed Reorder Qty.** reordering policies, the planning system focuses on the projected inventory in the given time-bucket only. It might suggest extra supply when negative demand or positive supply changes happen outside the time bucket. For extra supply, the planning system calculates the quantity by which you should decrease the supply. This quantity is called the "overflow level." The overflow is available as a planning line with a **Change Qty. (Decrease)** or **Cancel** action and the following warning message:  

* Attention: The projected inventory [xx] is higher than the overflow level [xx] on the Due Date [xx].*  

![Inventory overflow level.](media/supplyplanning_2_overflow1_new.png "Inventory overflow level")  

### Calculating the overflow level  

The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on the reordering policy.  

#### Maximum Qty.

Overflow level = maximum inventory  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use a minimum order quantity, it's added as follows:
>
> overflow level = maximum inventory + minimum order quantity.  

#### Fixed Reorder Qty.  

overflow level = reorder quantity + reorder point  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point, it's replaced as follows:
>
> overflow level = reorder quantity + minimum order quantity  

#### Order multiple  

If an order multiple exists, it adjusts the overflow level for both the Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies.  

### Creating the planning line with an overflow warning  

A planning line is created when a supply causes the projected inventory to be higher than the overflow level at the end of a time bucket. To warn about the extra supply, the planning line has a warning message, the **Accept Action Message** field isn't selected, and the action message is either **Cancel** or **Change Qty.**  

#### Calculating the planning line quantity  

The quantity on a planning line is calculated as follows:

planning line quantity = current supply quantity – (projected inventory – overflow level)  

> [!NOTE]  
> As with all warning lines, the maximum and minimum order quantity and order multiple are ignored.  

#### Defining the action message type  

* If the planning line quantity is higher than 0, the action message is **Change Qty.**  
* If the planning line quantity is equal to or less than 0, the action message is **Cancel**  

#### Composing the warning message  

If there's overflow, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays a warning message with the following information:  

* The projected inventory level that triggered the warning  
* The calculated overflow level  
* The due date of the supply event  

Example: “The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 01-28-23”  

### Example scenario  

In this scenario, a customer changes a sales order from 70 to 40 pieces between two planning runs. The overflow feature reduces the purchase that was suggested for the initial sales quantity.  

#### Item setup  

|Reordering Policy|Maximum Qty.|  
|-----------------------|------------------|  
|Maximum Order Quantity|100|  
|Reorder Point|50|  
|Inventory|80|  

#### Situation before a sales decrease  

|Event|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-70|10|  
|End of time bucket|None|10|  
|Suggest new purchase order|+90|100|  

#### Situation after sales decrease  

|Change|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-40|40|  
|Purchase|+90|130|  
|End of time bucket|None|130|  
|Suggest to decrease purchase<br><br> order from 90 to 60|-30|100|  

#### Resulting planning lines  

The system creates a warning planning line to reduce the purchase by 30, from 90 to 60, to keep the projected inventory at 100 according to the overflow level.  

![Plan according to overflow level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_overflow2.png "Plan according to overflow level")  

> [!NOTE]  
> Without the overflow feature, no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above the maximum, which could cause an extra supply of 30.

## Handling projected negative inventory

The reorder point expresses the anticipated demand during the lead time of the item. The projected inventory must be large enough to cover the demand until the new order is received. Meanwhile, the safety stock should take care of fluctuations in demand up to a targeted service level.  

The planning system considers it an emergency if a future demand can't be served from the projected inventory. Or, expressed in another way, that the projected inventory goes negative. The system suggests that you create a new supply order to cover the unmet part of the demand. The size of the new supply order doesn't consider the maximum inventory or the reorder quantity nor the following order modifiers:

* Maximum order quantity
* Minimum order quantity
* Order multiple 

Instead, it reflects the exact deficiency.  

The planning line for this type of supply order displays an **Emergency** warning icon provide additional information about the situation.  

In the following image, supply D represents an emergency order to adjust for negative inventory.  

![Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_negative_inventory.png "Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory")  

1. Supply **A**, initial projected inventory, is below the reorder point.  
2. A new forward-scheduled supply is created (**C**).  

     (quantity = maximum inventory – projected inventory level)  
3. Supply **A** is closed by demand **B**, which isn't fully covered.  

     (Demand **B** could try to schedule Supply C in, but the time-bucket prevents that.)  
4. New supply (**D**) is created to cover the remaining quantity on Demand **B**.  
5. Demand **B** is closed (creating a reminder to the projected inventory).  
6. The new supply **D** is closed.  
7. Projected inventory is checked. The reorder point isn't crossed.  
8. Supply **C** is closed (there's no more demand).  
9. Final check. There are no outstanding inventory level reminders.  

The following section describes the characteristics of the four supported reordering policies.

## Reordering policies

Reordering policies define how much to order when the item needs to be replenished. Four different reordering policies exist.  

### Fixed Reorder Quantity

The Fixed Reorder Qty. policy is typically used for inventory planning for items with the following characteristics:

* Low inventory cost
* Low risk of obsolescence
* Low number of items

Typically, use this policy with a reorder point that reflects the anticipated demand during the item's lead time.  

#### Calculated per time bucket  

If you reach or cross at the reorder point in a time bucket (reorder cycle), the system suggests two actions:

* Create a new supply order for the reorder quantity
* Forward schedule the order from the first date after the end of the time bucket  

The time bucketed reorder point reduces the number of supply suggestions. It reflects a process of manually checking to actual contents of bins in your warehouse.  

#### Creates only necessary supply  

Before it suggests a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks for the following supply:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

The system doesn't suggest a new supply order if a supply brings the projected inventory to the reorder point within the lead time.  

Supply orders that are created specifically to meet a reorder point are excluded from supply balancing and aren't changed. If you want to phase out an item that has a reorder point, review your outstanding supply orders manually or change the reordering policy to **Lot-for-Lot**. The system reduces or cancels extra supply.  

#### Combines with order modifiers  

The Minimum Order Quantity, Maximum Order Quantity, and Order Multiple order modifiers shouldn't play a significant role when you use the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy. However, the planning system takes them into account:

* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum order quantity (and create two or more supplies in order to reach the total order quantity)
* Increase the order to the specified minimum order quantity
* Round up the order quantity to meet a specified order multiple  

#### Combines with calendars  

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.  

#### Shouldn't be used with forecasts  

Because the anticipated demand is already expressed in the reorder point level, it isn't necessary to include a forecast in the planning. If it's relevant to base the plan on a forecast, use the **Lot-for-Lot** policy.  

#### Must not be used with reservations  

If you reserve a quantity, for instance a quantity in inventory, for a distant demand, you might disturb the planning foundation. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable in relation to the reorder point, the quantities might not be available. The system might try to compensate by creating exception orders. However, we recommend that the **Reserve** field is set to **Never** on items that are planned using a reorder point.

### Maximum Quantity

The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point.  

Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy. The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply. When you use the maximum quantity policy, the reorder quantity is defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level. Therefore, it usually differs from order to order.  

#### Calculate per time bucket

When you reach or cross the reorder point, the system determines the reorder quantity at the end of a time bucket. It measures the gap between the current projected inventory level and the specified maximum inventory to determine the quantity to order. The system then checks:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

If so, the system reduces the quantity of the new supply order by the quantities already ordered.  

If you don't specify a maximum inventory quantity, the planning system ensures that the projected inventory reaches the reorder quantity.

#### Combine with order modifiers

Depending on your setup, it might be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers:

* Ensure a minimum order quantity
* Round the quantity to an integer number of purchase units of measure
* Split the quantity into lots as defined by the maximum order quantity  

### Combine with calendars

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field in the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.

### Order

In a make-to-order environment, an item is purchased or produced to cover a specific demand. Typically, the Order reordering policy is used for items with the following characteristics

* Demand is infrequent
* The lead-time is insignificant
* Required attributes vary  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an order-to-order link, which acts as a preliminary connection between the supply (a supply order or inventory) and the demand. You can apply the order-to-order link during planning in the following ways:  

* When you use the Make-to-Order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project type production orders (producing needed components on the same production order)  
* When you use sales order planning to create a production order from a sales order  

> [!TIP]
> If item attributes don't vary, it might be best to use a Lot-for-Lot reordering policy. As a result, the system uses unplanned inventory and only accumulates sales orders with the same shipment date or within a defined time bucket.  

#### Order-to-order links and past due dates

Unlike most supply-demand sets, linked orders with due dates before the planning starting date are fully planned for by the system. The reason for this exception is that specific demand-supply sets must be synchronized. To learn more about the frozen zone that applies to most demand-supply types, go to [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).

### Lot-for-Lot

The Lot-for-Lot policy is the most flexible because the system only reacts to actual demand. It acts on anticipated demand from forecast and blanket orders and then settles the order quantity based on the demand. The policy is intended for items where inventory can be accepted but should be avoided.  

In some ways, the Lot-for-Lot policy is similar to the Order policy. It can accept quantities in inventory, and it bundles demand and supply in the time buckets you define.

You specify the time bucket in the **Time Bucket** field on the **Item Card** page. The minimum size of time bucket is one day, because that's the smallest time unit of measure on demand and supply events in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The time bucket also limits when you should reschedule a supply order to meet a given demand. Supply within the time bucket is rescheduled in or out to meet the demand. Earlier supply causes extra inventory, and you should cancel it. For supply that's later, create a new supply order.  

With this policy, you can specify a safety stock to compensate for changes in supply or to meet a sudden demand. The lot-for-lot policy can also include a dampener period and dampener quantity to reduce order scheduling.  

Together with the **Rescheduling Period** field, the **Lot Accumulation Period** field contributes to defining the reorder cycle. From the date of the first demand, the system accumulates all demands in the next lot accumulation period into one supply order on the date of the first demand. Demand that is outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by the supply order.

Because the supply order quantity is based on the actual demand, it can make sense to use order modifiers:

* Round up the order quantity to meet an order multiple (or purchase unit of measure)
* Increase the order to a specified minimum order quantity
* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum quantity (and thus create two or more supplies to reach the total needed quantity)

This article describes how the in-product search, *Tell me what you want to do*, can help you: 

* Quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports.
* Search for specific data, either on a list page or in all of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Find [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation about a subject you're interested in.

<!-- ![!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048] -->

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start a search.

When you start typing characters on the **Tell me what you want to do** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word *product* and the results include *items*, that's because search uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it opens a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell me what you want to do** page, the **exploring pages and reports** action opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

The **Tell me what you want to do** page categorizes results based on the data that you enter and the page you're working on. The following sections describe the categories.

## Find an action on the current page

The **On current page** section lets you find actions on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the Customer Card page for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs aren't included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer pages and tasks than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. Learn more about user experiences in [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find a record or search the documentation

The **Search for \<keyword\>** section [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple of ways to search:

* Use the **Search company data** action to search all pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about how the company data search works in [Search for a record in company data](ui-search-data.md).
* Use the **Search Help** action to find an article in the Business Central documentation that contains your keyword.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Your search results won't include documentation for third-party extensions.

### Use Tell me what you want to do

Use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you can find a customer by entering their name or address, or even find a specific record, such as a sales order. You can also use it to find information in our documentation.

Just enter at least three characters of a keyword, and then choose either **Search company data** or **Search Help**.

* If you search for data, results display on the **Search in company data** page, where they're sorted by type.  
* If you search in our Help, the **Help** pane offers links to articles that contain your keywords. You'll also get a snippet from the article that can help you decide whether it's what you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> For data, searching everything in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might take time. To speed up results, use the **Show tables to search** action to choose the tables and fields that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Use search on list pages

It isn't related to Tell me what you want to do, but there's another way to search for specific data. When you're using a list page, you can use the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** field in the left corner of list page headers to search for data on the page. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. Learn more about working with data on list pages in [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#searching).  

> [!TIP]
> You can search for posted document lines, such as invoice lines, credit memo lines, shipment lines, and receipt lines. Search for the type of document lines that you want to find, and then bookmark the links to the documents on your home page for easy access to the original or a filtered view. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

## Questions?

We've shown search to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list of frequently asked questions. If you're interested, go to [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).

# Managing Sales Opportunities
Any incoming lead can be considered a sales opportunity. You can create opportunities and associate them to a salesperson so that you can keep track of potential sales.

Before you can start using opportunity management, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. As you create opportunities, you should provide information about the contact, salesperson, sales cycle, and dates, as well as your estimates for the sales value of the opportunity and your estimation of the chances of its success.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| Set up the sales cycles that you usually follow, and the different stages within each opportunity sales cycle. |[Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md) |

# Accountant experiences in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. No matter what type of accountant you are, you can use the **Accountant** Role Center as your Home in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From here, you can access all pages that you need in your work.  

## Accountant Role Center

The Role Center is a dashboard with activity tiles that show you real-time key figures and give you quick access to data. The ribbon at the top of the page gives you access to more actions. For example, to open financial reports and statements in Excel. In the navigation bar at the top, you can quickly switch between the lists you use most often. Here, there are other areas, such as **Posted Documents** with the various types of documents that the company posted.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Product Videos** to watch videos or **Get Started** for a tour of key areas in the Role Center.

## Company Hub

If you work in multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, use the **Company Hub** page to keep track of work. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

## <a name="inviteaccountant"></a>Inviting a third-party accountant to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If a third-party accountant manages your books and financial reporting, your administrator can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. Both the Premium and Essentials [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses let you procure up to three **External Accountant** licenses per customer tenant. The licenses are free, but you do need to procure them like you would other licenses. To learn more about licensing, download the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

After your accountant can access your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], they can use the **Accountant** Role Center for easy access to the pages for their work. They can also use the company hub in their own [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage their work. Learn more in [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7ba6427f-cdf0-480d-8c98-b51f65437146]

It's easy to invite your external accountant. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Users** page, and then select the **Invite external accountant** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prepares an email for you. Just add your accountant's work email, and send the invitation.  

> [!Note]  
> This action requires that you set up email in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use SMTP. Learn more in [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The accountant's email address must be a work address based on Microsoft Entra ID. If the accountant uses another type of email, the invitation can't be sent.
>
> This task requires access to managing users and licenses in Microsoft Entra ID. The user who sends this invitation must be assigned at least the [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more in [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in the Microsoft 365 admin content.  

### Add your accountant to your Microsoft 365 tenant

If your admin or reselling partner prefers not to use the **Invite External Accountant** guide, you can add an external user to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Business Central and assign them the *External Accountant* license. You can add a user using the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Entra admin center, or Azure portal. The following procedure uses the Microsoft admin center. Learn about using the Microsoft Entra admin center at [Quickstart: Add a guest user and send an invitation](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

#### Add your accountant as a guest user

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Users**.
1. On the **Users** page, select **New user**, and then **Invite external user**.
1. On the **Invite external user** page, add the accountant's email address and other information about them.  

   Optionally, include a personal welcome message to let the accountant know that you're adding them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. When you're finished, select **Review + Invite**.
1. Review the information, and then choose **Invite**.

After you send the invitation, the external user receives an email invitation to join your organization. After they accept the invitation, the user account is added as a guest.

Next, assign the guest user a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Give your accountant access to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. In the [Microsoft admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), **Users** > **Guest users**.
1. Select the accountant's guest user account in the list, then select **Manage product licenses** to open the guest user profile pane.
1. Under **Licenses and apps**, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central External Accountant** license.  

   If this license isn't available, contact your reselling partner to add the license to your subscription.

   Specifically for evaluation purposes in a trial tenant, you can use an available **Dynamics 365 Business Central for IWs** license instead. However, you can't use this type of license if you already purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Select **Save changes**.

If successful, the license is assigned to the guest user, and the guest account is created.

### Import the new user into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

The accountant receives an email notifying them that they have access to your Microsoft Entra ID. Next, give them access to the correct company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Add the accountant to the correct company

1. Sign in to [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com).
1. Open company that you want to give the accountant access to. Learn more in [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then select the related link.  
1. Select the **Get New Users from Microsoft 365** action.

This action imports the user account that you created in the Azure portal to the company. Learn more in [To add a user in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

If you want to give access to multiple companies, then you must sign in to each company and repeat this process. Alternatively, you can update the permission groups for the accountant's user profile in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as assigning them the *D365 Bus Premium* user group. Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Inform your external accountant how to sign in to Business Central

Unlike internal users who access Business Central using the common URL `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, guest users must use the fully qualified domain name. The fully qualified domain name has the format `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/<tenant ID or domain name>`, such as `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee` or `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/contoso.com`.

Guest users can sign in using two methods. They can open their browser, enter the fully qualified domain name in the address bar, and sign in using their username and password. Alternatively, they can:

1. Enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` in the browser address bar.
1. Select **Sign in options**.
1. Select **Sign in to an organization**.
1. Enter the domain name of your organization, for example `contoso.com`, and then select **Next**.
1. Sign in using their username and password.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

On the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page, which you open from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal.

Similar functionality exists to reconcile excess amounts on payment reconciliation journal lines on an ad-hoc basis. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments that Can't be Applied Automatically](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

Payments posted based on text-to-account mapping are not applied to open entries, but are merely posted to the specified accounts in addition to creating bank account ledger entries. Accordingly, text-to-account mapping is suited for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. For more information, see the "Example - Text-to-Account Mapping for Fuel Expense" section in this article.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Payments on reconciliation journal lines are only set to posting according to text-to-account mapping if the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**. If the automatic application function provides a match confidence of High, then the payment is automatically applied to one or more open entries, and the payment is not posted to the accounts specified on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. In other words, a match confidence of **High** overrules a text-to-account mapping.

On a payment reconciliation journal line where the payment has been set to posting according to text-to-account mapping, the **Match Confidence** field contains **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**, and the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields contain the mapped accounts.

## To map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
4. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on payments that you want to post to specified accounts without applying to an open entry. You can enter up to 50 characters.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If no other payments exist with the mapping text in question, then the text-to-account mapping will occur even when only a part of the text on the payment exists as a mapping text.
5. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the payments will be posted to.
6. In the **Bal. Source Type** field, specify if the payment will be posted to a general ledger account or to a customer or vendor account.
7. In the **Bal. Source No.** field, specify the account that the payment will be posted to, depending on your selection in the **Bal. Source Type** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not use the **Debit Acc. No.** and **Credit Acc. No.** fields in connection with payment reconciliation. They are used for incoming documents only. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for all text on payments that you want to map to accounts for direct posting without application.

Next time you import a bank statement file or choose the **Apply Automatically** action on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, journal lines for the payments that contain the specified mapping text will contain the mapped accounts in the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields. The **Match Confidence** field will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**. This is on the condition that the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**.

## Example: Text-to-Account mapping for bank fees

To always post expenses that are related to fees from a specific bank, MyBank, to the general ledger account for bank charges and fees (account 60400), fill a line on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page as follows.

| Mapping Text | Debit Acc. No. | Credit Acc. No. | Bal. Source Type | Bal. Source No. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyBank |BLANK |60400|G/L Account |BLANK |

# Warnings and error messages

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it wasn't possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name to read a short description. Choose the **Ask Copilot** link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.  

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central User Assistance Model](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/user-assistance) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help and Support page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help and Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your questions. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## Help others

If you're an administrator or superuser, you can help others by looking up error messages in the **Error Message Register** page or in the administration center. In many cases, the warning or error message is about setup or lack of permission and similar issues that the superuser or administrator can easily help with. In other cases, you might have to inspect pages to identify the cause. For more information, see [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Share error details for faster assistance

To overcome obstacles and minimize downtime, apply the expertise of colleagues or subject matter experts. When an error blocks you, you can easily share the error details when you get assistance.

The details include the error message, error code, and other information that's helpful when troubleshooting an error. By sharing the error details, you can effectively communicate the specific issue you're facing, which helps your colleagues help you.  

You can copy details by choosing the **Share icon** in in-line validation dialogs, or the **Share details** menu in error dialogs.  

In addition to copying error details, you can also choose to share details through Microsoft Teams by choosing **Share details to Teams** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open the **Share to Teams** window, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced the error to make troubleshooting easier.

You can also choose to share details by email by choosing **Share details via email** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.

## Help yourself

Error messages provide information and actions that make it easier to understand, go to, and resolve errors that come from the platform.

The error messages that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform generates contain the full technical details, including field names, in the **Detailed error message** section. Select the **Copy details** icon on inline validation errors or in an error message to access the technical information.

Actions on error messages take you directly to the page where a field is causing the error. You don't have to take time to find the page or field yourself. To resolve the error, just choose the action in the error message and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes you to the appropriate location.

The following video shows how to use actionable error messages to get unblocked.

### Tip for developers

If you're a developer, when you call the [TestField](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-testfield-joker-joker-errorinfo-method) method, but don't pass in the |`ErrorInfo` object, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically generates the link to a page where a user can correct the issue. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] first gets the lookup or drill-down page for the record, and then finds the card page or lookup page and adds a navigation link to that card page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't add a link in the following situations:

* If the error is on the page that's currently open.
* If the user doesn't have permission to modify the underlying record.

# Analyzing report data with Excel and XML

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

As a developer or advanced user, it helps to inspect the data that is generated for a given report dataset while you create new reports or modify existing ones. To support this capability, you can export a report dataset as raw data to an Excel workbook or XML file&mdash;directly. In Excel, for example, you can then do ad-hoc analysis of the data and diagnose issues.

## Get started

To export a report dataset to an Excel workbook or XML file, open the report in the client, then in the request page, select **Send to** > **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** or **XML Document**. The file downloads to your device.

## More about Excel (data only)

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports the report results and the criteria used to generate them&mdash;but it doesn't include the report layout. The Excel file includes the full dataset, as raw data, arranged in rows and columns. All data columns of the report's dataset are included, regardless of whether they're used in the report layout.

Once you have the Excel file, you can start analyzing the data. For example, you could filter the data and use Power Pivot to display it.

Each time you export results, a new worksheet is created. Using the **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option, you can run the same report and reuse formatting changes. For example, for Power Pivot, you can run the report again for another time period, copy the results to the worksheet, and then refresh the worksheet. You can also find a reporting app on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't export a report that has more than 1,048,576 rows or 16,384 columns. With Business Central on-premises, the maximum number of exported rows might be even less. Business Central Server includes a configuration setting, called **Max Data Rows Allowed to Send to Excel**, for decreasing the limit from the maximum value. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General) or contact your administrator.

## For administrators

- **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** was introduced as an optional feature in the 2021 release wave 1, update 18.3. To give users access to this feature when running 2021 release wave 1, enable the **Save report dataset to Microsoft Excel Document** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management). In 2021 release wave 2, this feature became permanent.

- To use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, user accounts need the **Allow Action Export Report Dataset To Excel** permission. You can give users this permission by assigning either the **Troubleshooting Tools** or **Export Report Excel** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md)  

## For developers and advanced users

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports all columns, including columns that hold filters and formatting instructions for other values. Here are a few points of interest:

- Binary data in a field, like an image, isn't exported.

  In columns that hold binary data, fields include the text **Binary data ({0} bytes)**, where **{0}** indicates the number of bytes.
- The Excel file also includes the **Report Metadata** worksheet.

  This worksheet shows the filters applied to the report and general report properties, like the name, ID, and extension details. The filters are shown in the **Filter (DataItem::Table::FilterGroupNo::FieldName)** column. The filters in this column include filters set on the report's request page. It also includes filters defined in AL code, for example, by the [DataItemLink property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemlink-reports-property) and [DataItemTableView property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemtableview-property).

- This measure calculates the deviation between the actual consumption cost amount and the expected consumption cost amount, expressed as a percentage.

  *Consumption Cost Amt. Deviation % = ([Consumed Cost Amount (Actual)](#consumed-cost-amount-actual) - [Expected Consumption Cost Amount](#expected-consumption-cost-amount)) / [Expected Consumption Cost Amount](#expected-consumption-cost-amount)*

**Data Sources**
- Item Ledger Entry
- Prod. Order Component

### Consumption Cost Amt. Variance
**Formula**  
- This measure shows the variance between the expected cost of consumed items and the actual cost of consumed items. 

  *Consumption Cost Amt. Variance = -([Expected Consumption Cost Amount](#expected-consumption-cost-amount) - [Consumed Cost Amount (Actual)](#consumed-cost-amount-actual))*

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component
- Item Ledger Entry

### Consumption Qty. Deviation%
**Formula**  
( [Qty. Consumed (Base)](#qty-consumed-base) - [Expected Consumption Qty. (Base)](#expected-consumption-qty-base) ) / [Expected Consumption Qty. (Base)](#expected-consumption-qty-base)

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component
- Item Ledger Entry

### Consumption Qty. Variance
**Formula**  
[Expected Consumption Qty. (Base)](#expected-consumption-qty-base) - [Qty. Consumed (Base)](#qty-consumed-base)

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component
- Item Ledger Entry

## Consumption Measures
- [Consumed Cost Amount (Actual)](#consumed-cost-amount-actual)
- [Expected Consumption Cost Amount](#expected-consumption-cost-amount)
- [Expected Consumption Qty. (Base)](#expected-consumption-qty-base)
- [Qty. Consumed (Base)](#qty-consumed-base)
- [Rem. Consumption Cost Amt.](#rem-consumption-cost-amt)
- [Rem. Qty. to Consume (Base)](#rem-qty-to-consume-base)

### Consumed Cost Amount (Actual)
**Formula**  
- This measure shows the actual cost of consumed items for a given period by summing up the actual cost of each item used in production. To calculate this cost amount, the measure calculates the sum of the actual cost of items consumed from the Production Data Table, filtered for the Consumption data source.

**Data Sources**
- Item Ledger Entry

### Expected Consumption Cost Amount
**Formula**  
- This measure shows the expected cost of consumed items for a given period by summing up the expected consumption cost of each item used in production. To calculate this cost amount, the measure multiplies the expected consumption quantity of each item by its related unit cost and then sums up the results from the Production Data table.

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component

### Expected Consumption Qty. (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the expected consumption quantity by summing up the Expected Consumption Qty. (Base) for each Prod. Order Component from the Production Data table.

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component

### Qty. Consumed (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the quantity consumed by summing up Quantity for each consumption Item Ledger Entry from the Production Data table.

**Data Sources**
- Item Ledger Entry

### Rem. Consumption Cost Amt.
**Formula**  
- The Rem. Consumption Cost Amt. measure calculates the total remaining consumption cost for production order components. It filters the Production Data Table to include only rows where the [Data Source] is Prod. Order Component. For these rows, it multiplies the Rem. Qty. to Consume (Base) by the Unit Cost (LCY) from the related Item table. 

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component
- Item

### Rem. Qty. to Consume (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the remaining quantity to consume by summing up Remaining Qty. (Base) for each consumption Prod. Order Component from the Production Data table.

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Component

**Formula**  
- This measure shows total actual cost amount for finished goods produced by summing up the actual cost amount for each output item ledger entry from the Production Data Table.
  
**Data Sources**
- Item Ledger Entry

### Finished Quantity (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of finished products produced in base units over a given period by summing up all the output quantities from the Production Data table.

**Data Sources**
- Item Ledger Entry

### Remaining Cost Amt.
**Formula**
- This measure calculates the total remaining cost for production order lines. It filters the Production Data Table to include only rows where [Data Source] is Prod. Order Line. For each of these rows, it multiplies [Remaining Qty. (Base)] by the [Unit Cost (LCY)] from the related Item table. 

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Line.
- Item

### Remaining Qty. (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total remaining quantity for production order lines. It sums the [Remaining Qty. (Base)] column in the Production Data Table, but only for rows where [Data Source] is Prod. Order Line. 

**Data Sources**
- Prod. Order Line

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.  

Your administrator can learn more about trials and subscriptions [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions).  

## Copy a company

On the **Companies** page, you can use the **Copy** action to create a second company based on the contents of an existing company. Copying a company is useful, for example, when you want to test a company without disrupting production data.

> [!Important]
> Don't use the Copy action to take a backup of a company. To take a backup, start by exporting the database as a .bacpac file. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export) in the development and administration help.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dataverse-copy-company](includes/dataverse-copy-company.md)]

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you won't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

For more information, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). For more information about environments, see [Understanding the Infrastructure of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology) (in English only).  

## Changing a company's name

After you create a company, you can't change its name. You can, however, change its **Display Name**, which is text that shows for the company throughout the application.  

> [!TIP]
> You can rename a company if you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Add Contoso Coffee

The Contoso Coffee app provides demonstration data to help you explore the advanced capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Find the app in AppSource, and install it in an empty company, for example a company in a sandbox environment. For more information, see [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

# Create Reports with XBRL

> [!NOTE]
> We're in the process of removing the features for XBRL reporting from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Changes in 2022 release wave 1](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1).

XBRL (e**X**tensible **B**usiness **R**eporting **L**anguage) is a language, based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), for tagging financial data, which enables businesses to efficiently and accurately process and share their data. The XBRL initiative enables global financial reporting by numerous enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies and international accounting organizations. The goal of the initiative is to provide a standard for uniform reporting of financial information for banks, investors, and government authorities. Such business reporting can include:  

* Financial statements  
* Financial information  
* Non-financial information  
* Regulatory filings, such as annual and quarterly financial statements  

> [!NOTE]
> You can import general ledger-related schemas and create XBRL instance documents by mapping general ledger (G/L) data from the chart of accounts to elements in taxonomies designed for financial reports, such as balance sheets, income statements, and so on.
>
> The XBRL capabilities in Business Central support taxonomies for specification 2.1. However, taxonomies may contain unsupported elements such as formula linkbases or iXBRL (inline XBRL), or have other structural differences. We recommend you validate the XBRL capability before using it for reporting.
>
> Full support for taxonomies may require third-party XBRL tagging and tools. The XBRL International organization has a list of tools and services; depending on the XBRL reporting requirements for a given taxonomy, you may want to explore those resources. Learn more at [Getting Started for Business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153466) and [Tools and Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153356).

## eXtensible Business Reporting Language

The XBRL taxonomies are maintained by www.xbrl.org. You can download taxonomies and read more detailed information on the XBRL website.  

Let's say someone wants financial information from you. They provide you with a taxonomy (an XML document) containing one or more schemas, each with one or more lines to fill out. The lines correspond to the individual financial facts required by the sender. You import this taxonomy, then fill out the schema(s) by entering the account(s) that corresponds with each line and which calculation is desired, such as net change or balance at date. In some cases you can enter a constant instead, for example, the number of employees. You are now ready to send the instance document (an XML document) to the requester. The idea is that this might be a recurring event, so unless changes have been made to the taxonomy, you just export new instance documents for new periods on request.

## XBRL comprises the following components

The XBRL **Specification** explains what XBRL is and how to build XBRL instance documents and taxonomies. The XBRL specification explains XBRL in technical terms and is intended for a technical audience.  

The XBRL **Schema** are the core low-level components of XBRL. The schema is the physical XSD (also called an XML schema definition) file that expresses how XBRL instance documents and taxonomies are to be built.

The XBRL **Linkbases** are the physical XML files that contain information about the elements defined in the XBRL Schema, such as labels in one or more languages, how they relate to each other, how to sum up elements, and so on.  

An XBRL **Taxonomy** is a "vocabulary" or "dictionary" created by a group, compliant with the XBRL specification, that enables the exchange of business information.  

An XBRL **Instance document** is a business report, such as a financial statement prepared to the XBRL specification. The meaning of the values in the instance document is explained by the taxonomy. In fact, an instance document is somewhat useless unless you know the taxonomy for which it is prepared.  

## Layered taxonomies

A taxonomy can consist of a base taxonomy, for example US GAAP (United States generally accepted accounting principles) or IAS (international accounting standards), and then have one or more extensions. To reflect this, a taxonomy refers to one or more schemas, each of which are separate taxonomies themselves. When the additional taxonomies are loaded into the database, the new elements are simply added to the end of the existing elements.  

## Linkbases

In XBRL Spec. 2, the taxonomy is described in several XML files. The primary XML file is the taxonomy schema file itself (.xsd file) which only contains an unordered list of elements or facts to be reported. In addition to this, there are usually some linkbase files (.xml). The linkbase files contain data that is complementary to the raw taxonomy (.xsd file). There are six types of linkbases files of which four have relevance for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These are:

* Label linkbase: This linkbase contains labels or names for the elements. The file may contain labels in different languages which are identified with an XML property called 'lang'. The XML language identifier usually contains a two-letter abbreviation, and although it should be easy to guess what the abbreviation means, there is no connection to Microsoft Windows language code or the language codes defined in the demo data. Therefore, when you look up the languages for a specific taxonomy, you see all the labels for the first element in the taxonomy, meaning you can see an example of each language. A taxonomy can have several label linkbases attached to it as long as those linkbases contain different languages.  
* Presentation linkbase: This linkbase contains information about the structure of the elements or, more precisely, how the issuer of the taxonomy suggests the application presents the taxonomy to you. The linkbase contains a series of links that each connect two elements in a parent-child relationship. When applying all these links, the elements can be shown in a hierarchical way. Note that the presentation linkbase deals with just that: the presentation of elements to you.
* Calculation linkbase: This linkbase contains information about how the elements roll up. The structure is quite similar to the presentation linkbase, except that each link, or 'arc' as they are called, has a weight property. The weight can be either 1 or –1, indicating whether the element should be added to or subtracted from its parent. Note that the rollups do not necessarily align with the visual presentation.  
* Reference linkbase: This linkbase is an xml file containing supplementary information about the data required by the taxonomy issuer.

## Set up XBRL lines

After you import or update the taxonomy, the lines of the schemas must filled out with all information required to satisfy the particular financial reporting requirements. This information includes basic company information, the actual financial statements, notes to the financial statements, supplemental schedules, and so on.  

You set up XBRL lines by mapping the data in the taxonomy to the data in your general ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, select a taxonomy from the list.  
3. Choose the **Lines** action.  
4. Select a line and fill in the fields.  
5. To read detailed information about what to fill in, choose the **Information** action.  
6. To set up mapping the G/L accounts in the chart of accounts to the XBRL lines, choose the **G/L Map Lines** action.  
7. To add notes to the financial statement, choose the **Notes** action.  

   > [!TIP]
   > To exclude lines from the exported data, choose **NOT APPLICABLE** as the source type.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can only export data that corresponds to the selection in the **Source Type** field. This includes descriptions and notes.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Taxonomies might contain elements that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support. If an element is not supported, the **Source Type** field will display **Not Applicable** and the **Description** field will show an error message, such as **Unexpected type: "specific type not recognized"**. If you must export the element, choose a matching source type. Typically, this is a constant or a description. Doing this enables you to enter and export data, however, such elements might have validation rules that cannot be checked before exporting.

## Import an XBRL taxonomy

The first step in working with the XBRL functionality is to import a taxonomy into your company database. A taxonomy consists of one or more schemas and some linkbases. After you have completed the import of both schemas and linkbases and have applied the linkbases to the schema, you can set up the lines and map the general ledger accounts in the chart of accounts to the appropriate taxonomy lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, create a new line and enter the name and description of the taxonomy.  
3. Choose the **Schemas** action, then insert the description of the schema.  
4. To import the schema, on the **XBRL Schemas** page, choose the **Import** action, then do one of the following steps to upload the file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]
5. To import the linkbase, on the **XBRL Schemas** page, choose the **Linkbases** action, then do one of the following steps to upload the file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)] 
6. You can now choose to apply the linkbase to the schema. Repeat until you have imported all linkbases.  
7. Choose the **Apply to Taxonomy** action to apply the linkbase to the schema.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Instead of individually applying the linkbases after the import, you can wait until you have imported all linkbases and then apply them at the same time. To do this, choose **NO** when you are prompted to apply the newly imported linkbase to the schema. Then select the lines with the linkbases that you want to apply.  

## Update an XBRL taxonomy

When a taxonomy changes you need to update the current taxonomy accordingly. The reason for the update can be an altered schema, an altered linkbase, or a new linkbase. After updating the taxonomy, you only need to map the lines for the changed or new lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, choose the **Schemas** action.

# Edit Posted Documents

Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents across all supported markets:

- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in the specified countries or regions:

- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment

The following explains how to edit a posted sales shipment. The steps are similar for the other supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the document that you want to edit, and then choose the **Update Document** action. Alternatively, open the document and then choose the action.
3. On the **Posted Sales Shipment - Update** page, edit the **Package Tracking No.** field, for example.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The posted sales shipment is updated.

# Purchases by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Location** report provides an overview of purchasing activities for each warehouse location. It helps you find out which item categories and items are most frequently purchased in each location, and how much money you're spending on the purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze purchasing trends across different warehouse locations. For example, you can use the report to find the most frequently bought items and item categories in each warehouse. You and the warehousing team can gain insights into warehouses with consistently high or low purchasing activities.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities across warehouse locations. For example, you can find item categories and items with low quantities that require attention to prevent stock-outs or disruptions in production. Use this information to plan ahead and work with your team to ensure that you meet purchase demand across locations.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Location* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Location
- Item
- Value Entry
- Purchase Line

# Count, adjust, and reclassify inventory using journals

To ensure that your quantities are correct, physically count all of the items in your inventory. Some businesses do an annual physical count, and others count all or only some items more often. After you count items, use journals to post the actual quantities to the general ledger. For example, when you valuate inventory at the end of a period.

To count some items more often than others, perhaps because of their value, use cycle counts. For cycle counts, assign special counting periods to the items. Learn more at [To do cycle counting](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-do-cycle-counting).

To adjust quantities after a physical count or other purposes, use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries without posting transactions. You can also adjust the quantity for a single item on an item card.

To change attributes on item ledger entries, use an item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include dimensions and sales campaign codes. You can also use reclassification journals for transfers by reclassifying bin and location codes. Special steps apply when you want to reclassify serial or lot numbers and their expiration dates. For more information, see [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-step processes, items are registered in bins as warehouse entries, not as item ledger entries. Therefore, you do counting, adjusting, and reclassifying in warehouse journals that support bins. Then you synchronize the new or changed warehouse entries with their related item ledger entries to reflect the changes in inventory quantities and values.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

## To count physical inventory

To check whether the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock, count your physical inventory. That is, count the actual items on hand. Typically, counts happen at the end of a fiscal year, but some businesses count items more often. If there are differences, post the actual quantities to the item accounts before you do inventory valuation.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to do a physical inventory using a journal on the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. You can use documents on the **Physical Inventory Order** and **Physical Inventory Recording** pages. These documents offer more control and support for distributing the counting work to multiple employees. Learn more at [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md).<br /><br />
> Note that you can't use the document-based functionality to count items in bins or warehouse entries.

The counting process also involves the following tasks:

- Calculate the expected inventory.
- Print the report you want to use for the count.
- Enter and post the actual quantities.

Depending on your warehouse setup, count physical inventory in one of the following ways. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and pick, use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. The procedure is similar to physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--We should say what to do on each of these pages.-->

### To calculate expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action from **Prepare**.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory** page, specify the conditions to use to create the journal lines, such as whether to include items that have zero recorded inventory.
4. Set filters if you only want to calculate inventory for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries are processed according to the information that you specified, and lines are created in the physical inventory journal. Notice that the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field has the same quantity as the **Qty. (Calculated)** field. You don't need to enter the counted quantity for items where these values match. However, if the quantity counted differs, enter the quantity that was counted.

### To print the report to be used when counting

1. On the **Physical Inventory Journals** page containing the calculated expected inventory, Choose the **Print** action from **Home**.
2. On the **Physical Inventory List** page, specify whether the report will show the calculated quantity and inventory items by serial and lot numbers.
3. Set filters if you only want to print the report for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
4. Choose **Print**.

Warehouse employees can now count inventory and record any differences on the printed report.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days before printed reports come back for final processing and posting. When you specify and post actual counted inventory, the system adjusts inventory to reflect the difference between the expected and the actual counted inventory. You must keep the originally calculated journal lines and not recalculate the expected inventory, because the expected inventory may change and lead to incorrect inventory levels. If you need to issue multiple reports, such as for different locations or group of items, you must create and keep separate journal batches.

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. On each line on the **Physical Inventory Journals** page where the actual inventory on hand, as determined by the physical count, differs from the calculated quantity, enter the actual inventory on hand in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the physical count reveals differences caused by items posted with incorrect locations, don't enter the differences in the physical inventory journal. Instead, use a reclassification journal or a transfer order to redirect the items to the correct locations. 

2. To adjust the calculated quantities to the actual counted quantities, choose the **Post** action from **Home**.

    Posting creates item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries. Open the Item Card page for the item to find its physical inventory ledger entries.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
4. To verify the count, open the **Item Card** page for the item, and choose the **Phys. Inventory Ledger Entries** action from **Item**
1. .

### To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

Synchronize item ledger and warehouse <!--warehouse what?--> before you count physical inventory. Otherwise, what you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger is the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items. Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action to open the **Whse. Calculate Inventory** page.  
3. Set the filters to specify the items to count in the journal, and then choose **OK**.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a line for each bin that meets the filter requirements. You can delete lines, but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory, count the item in all the bins that contain it.  

   If you only count an item in some bins but not others, you can enter differences and post them in the **Item Journal** page later by using the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

1. On the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page, enter the actual quantities in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Qty. (Calculated)** field is filled in based on bin records. This quantity is copied to the **Qty. (Physical)** field on each line. If the quantities in these fields don't match, enter the actual quantity.  

2. After you enter all actual quantities, choose the **Register** action.  

    When you register the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered:  

    - If the calculated and the actual quantities differ, a negative or positive quantity is registered for the bin, and a balancing quantity is posted to the location's adjustment bin.  
    - If the calculated quantity equals the physical quantity, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] registers **0** for both the bin and the adjustment bin. 

When you register physical inventory, you don't post to the item, physical inventory, or the value ledgers. However, the records are available for reconciliation when needed. To keep quantities accurate, after you count items in all bins, post the results.<!--physical inventory journal--> Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

## To do cycle counting

You can count items as often as you'd like. For example, because they're more valuable or top sellers. Specify the counting frequency by assigning special counting periods to the items.

Depending on your warehouse setup, you can do cycle counting in the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and picks, use the **Physical Inventory Journal** page. The steps are similar to counting physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--we should say what to do on each of these pages-->  

### To set up counting periods

Counting physical inventory is typically a recurring task, for example monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can set up the inventory counting periods you need and assign one to each item. Afterward, use the **Calculate Counting Period** action on the **Physical Inventory Journal** page to automatically create lines for the items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Counting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To assign a counting period to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period.  
3. In the **Phys Invt Counting Period Code** field, select the counting period.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're changing the counting period, a message displays information about the results of the change. Choose **Yes** to change the code and calculate the first counting period for the item. The next time you choose to calculate a counting period in the physical inventory journal, the item appears as a line on the **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page. You can then count the item periodically.

### To start a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page shows items that need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).

### To start a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page show items need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Count the item in all bins that contain it. If you delete bin lines that were retrieved for counting on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory** page, the count will be incorrect when you post it in a physical inventory journal.  

## To adjust the quantity of one item

After you do a physical count of an item, use the **Adjust Inventory** action to record the actual inventory quantity.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field for the location, enter the result of the count.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

<!-- I don't see a "Quantity on Hand" field on the Item Card page. Should this point to the options for viewing availability?

The item’s inventory is adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Quantity on Hand** field on the **Item Card** page.-->

You can also use the **Adjust Inventory** action as an easy way to add purchased items to inventory if you don't use purchase invoices or orders to record your purchases. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> After you adjust inventory, update its current value. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

### To adjust the quantities of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations

On the **Item Journals** page, you can post item transactions directly to adjust inventory for purchases, sales, and positive or negative changes without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, for material consumption, the **Standard Item Journal** page can make this recurring work easier. For more information, see [Work with Standard Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-standard-journals).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to adjust the quantities.

### To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations

If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Item Journal** page to post unplanned positive and negative quantity changes. For example, for items posted as missing that show up unexpectedly, or losses due to breakage.  

Warehouse item journals give you more levels of adjustment to make your quantities more precise. The warehouse knows how many items are on hand and where they're stored, but each adjustment isn't posted to the item ledger. Credits or debits are made to the real bin with the quantity adjustment. A balancing entry is made in an adjustment bin. The adjustment bin is a virtual bin with no real items. You specify the virtual bin in the **Invt. Adjustment Bin Code** field on **Location Card** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the header information.  
3. In the **Item No.** field on the line, choose the item.  
4. Enter the bin in which you're putting the extra items or where items are missing.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, if you find extra items, enter a positive quantity. If items are missing, enter a negative quantity.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.

## To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries

Post the adjustment bin records in the item ledger for the defined periods. Some companies post daily adjustments to the item ledger, while others reconcile less often.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on each journal line.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action, and then add filters on the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** page. Adjustments are calculated only for the entries in the adjustment bin that meet the filter requirements.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Document No.** field with a number. The number displays on the item journal lines.
5. Choose **OK**. The positive and negative adjustments are totaled for each item, and lines are created in the item journal.  
6. Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger. The quantities in the bins and the item ledger now match.

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.  

### To synchronize records of an integration table mapping  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Planning With or Without Locations

Before you start utilizing planning engine, we recommend deciding about whether or not to use locations. There are two main straightforward ways:

* demand lines always carry location codes and the system fully uses stockkeeping units, including the relevant location setup. Learn more at [Demand at location](#demand-at-location).  
* demand lines never carry location codes and the system uses the item card. See the [Demand at a "blank location"](#demand-at-blank-location) scenario below.

## Demand at location  

When the planning system detects demand at a location (a line with a location code), it will behave in different ways depending on 2 critical setup values.  

During a planning run, the system checks for the 2 setup values in sequence and plans accordingly:  

1. Does a SKU exist for the item on the demanded location?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card.  

    If no, then:  

2. Does the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page contain the demanded location code?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

    If no, then:  

    The item is planned according to the "minimal alternative" which covers the exact demand. The planning parameters are set as: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot*, Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty. (Items using reordering policy *Order* remain using *Order* as well as the other settings.)

> [!TIP]
> If you often plan for demand at different locations, then we recommend that you use the stockkeeping units capability and avoid demand on blank location. Learn more at [Set Up Stockkeeping Units](inventory-how-to-set-up-stockkeeping-units.md)

See variations in the [scenarios below](#scenarios).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page are very important in governing how the planning system handles production demand lines.
>
> For production demand, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the same location for subassembly and components as the one stated on the production order. However, by filling in this field, you can redirect the subassembly and components to another location.
>
> You can also define this for a specific SKU by selecting a different location code in the **Components at Location** field on the SKU card. Note, however, that this rarely makes sense as the planning logic may be distorted when planning for the SKU component.

## Demand at "blank location"

In general, when the planning system detects demand at a blank location (a line without a location code), the item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

The **Locations Mandatory** field in the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page, or stockkeeping units will affect how the planning system handles demand lines with/without location codes. If one of following statements is true, the demand on blank location is also considered a deviation and the planning system will react by outputting the "minimal alternative": The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

* The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page has a value.
* A stockkeeping unit exists for the planned item.
* The **Location Mandatory** field is selected.

## Scenarios

See variations in the setup scenarios below.

### Setup 1

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* SKU is set up for *WEST*  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 1.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card (including possible transfer).

#### Case 1.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

#### Case 1.3: Demand is at *MAIN* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 1.4: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 2

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 2.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 2.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

### Setup 3

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 3.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 3.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

#### Case 3.3: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 4

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *BLANK*  

#### Case 4.1: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 4.2: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

As you can see from the last scenario, the only way to get a correct result for a demand line without a location code is to disable all setup values relating to locations. Similarly, the only way to get stable planning results for demand at locations is to use stockkeeping units.  

Therefore, if you often plan for demand at locations, then we recommend that you use the Stockkeeping Units capability.

# Run Full Planning, MPS, or MRP

The terms "running the planning worksheet" or "running MRP" refer to calculating the master production schedule and material requirements. The calculation is based on actual and forecasted demand. The planning system can calculate either Master Production Schedule (MPS) or Material Requirements Planning (MRP) on request, or both at the same time.  

- MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called MPS items and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
- MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that are not MPS items. The purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the appropriate item, at the appropriate time, in the appropriate location, and in the appropriate quantity.  

The planning algorithms for MPS and MRP are the same. The algorithms pertain to netting, reusing existing replenishment orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is, or will be, needed (demand) and what's on-hand or expected (supply). When you net these quantities against each other, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides action messages. Action messages are suggestions to create a new order, change an order (quantity or date), or cancel an order. The term "order" includes purchase orders, assembly orders, production orders, and transfer orders.

You can track the links that the planning creates between demand and supply on the **Order Tracking** page. For more information, see [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards, assembly BOMs, production BOMs, and routings.  

## Methods for generating a plan  

- **Calculate Regenerative Plan:** Process or regenerate the material plan. This process starts by deleting all planned supply orders that are currently loaded. All items in the database are replanned.  
- **Calculate Net Change Plan**: Process a net change plan. Items are considered in net change planning from two types of changes:  
   - **Demand/supply changes:** These changes include modifications to quantities on sales orders, demand forecasts, assembly orders, production orders, or purchase orders. An unplanned inventory level change is also considered a quantity change.  
   - **Planning parameter changes:** These changes include changes in safety stock, reorder point, routing, bill of material, and changes to the time bucket or lead time calculation.  
- **Get Action Messages:** Serves as a short-term planning tool by issuing action messages to alert the user of modifications made since the last time you calculated a regenerative or net change plan.  

With each planned method, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates worksheet entries assuming infinite capacity. Work center and machine center capacity isn't considered when you develop schedules.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Calculate Regenerative Plan is the most common process. The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages, however, can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process.  
>
> You can run the Get Action Messages Plan between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes. However, it isn't meant to replace the full regenerative or net change planning processes.  

## To calculate the planning worksheet
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action to open the **Calculate Plan** page.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**MPS**|Calculate a master production schedule. Items with open sales orders or demand forecasts are considered in this run. <br/>If other demands, for example safety stock, reorder point, or open production component lines, also exist for such items these demands are included in the MPS calculation to ensure that the planning system deals with the complete inventory profile.  |  
    |**MRP**|Calculate material requirements planning. Items with dependent requirements are considered in this run. Typically, MPS and MRP are run at the same time. To run MPS and MRP at the same time, on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Combined MPS/MRP Calculation** field.|  
    |**Starting Date**|Evaluate inventory availability. If an item's on-hand quantity is below the reorder point, the system forward-schedules a replenishment order from this date. If an item is below its safety stock (as of the starting date), the system back-schedules a replenishment order due on the planning starting date.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The ending date of the planning horizon. Neither demand nor supply are considered after this date. If the reorder cycle for an item extends beyond the ending date, the effective planning horizon for that item is equal to the order date plus the reorder cycle.<br/><br/> The planning horizon is the time that the plan is extended to. If the horizon is too short, items with a longer lead time aren't ordered on time. If the horizon is too long, too much time is spent reviewing and processing information that likely changes before it's needed. You can set one planning horizon for production and a longer one for purchases, although it isn't required. A planning horizon for purchases and production should be set to cover the total lead time for components.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the planning run to stop as soon as it encounters an error. A message displays with information about the error. If an error exists, only the successful planning lines made before the error was encountered are presented in the planning worksheet. If you don't select this field, the **Calculate Plan** batch job continues until it completes. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If one or more errors exist, a message displays after completion with information about how many items are affected. The **Planning Error Log** page will then open to provide more details about the error and links to the affected item cards.|  
    |**Use Forecast**|Select a forecast to include as demand when you run the planning batch job. The default forecast is set up on the **Planning** FastTab on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.|  
    |**Exclude Forecast Before**|Define how much of the selected forecast to include in the planning run by entering a date before which forecast demand is not included.|  
    |**Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings**|By default, this field is selected.<br/><br/> Supply on planning lines with warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can define certain planning parameters for planning lines to be respected with certain warnings.<br/><br/>|  

4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to run the planning based on the item, item description, or location.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The batch job runs and planning lines are added to the planning worksheet.  

## To perform action messages
  
1. On the **Planning Worksheet** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
2. On the **Options** FastTab, specify how to create the supplies. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Production Order**|Specify how to create production orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals. You can create either planned or firm planned production orders.|  
    |**Assembly Order**|Specify how to create assembly orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.|  
    |**Purchase Order**|Specify how to create purchase orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for purchase orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Transfer Order**|Specify how to create transfer orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for transfer orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Combine Transfer Orders**|Select whether to combine transfer orders.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the **Carry Out Action Msg. - Plan.** batch job to stop as soon as it finds an error. Aa message displays information about the error. If an error exists, only the planning lines processed before the error was found will create supply orders.|  

3. On the **Planning Line** FastTab, you can set filters to limit the perform action messages.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message. The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted. You can also delete the lines manually.  

## Action messages
  
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network. The messages can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish balance between supply and demand.  

The generation of action messages occurs one level at a time, for each item's low-level code. This makes sure that all items that experience or will experience changes in supply or demand are considered.  

To avoid small, unneeded, or unimportant action messages, you can set dampeners, which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days.  

After you review the action messages and determine whether to accept some or all of the suggested changes, select the **Accept Action Message** field. Next, update the schedules accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
> An action message is a suggestion to create a new order, cancel an order, or change the quantity or date of an order. An order is a purchase order, transfer order, or production order.  

In response to any supply/demand imbalances, the following action messages are generated.  

|Action Message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**New**|If a demand can't be fulfilled by suggesting action messages to **Change Qty.**, **Reschedule**, or **Reschedule & Change Qty.** on existing orders, the action message **New** is generated to suggest a new order. The message **New** is also generated if there aren't supply orders in the reorder cycle of the item. This option determines the number of periods forward and backward in the availability profile when it searches for an order to reschedule.|  
|**Change Quantity**|When the quantity changes for a demand that's tracked to a supply order, the action message **Change Qty.** is generated. The message indicates that the related supply should be changed relative to the change in demand. If a new demand emerges, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for the nearest existing unreserved supply order in the reorder cycle, and issues a change of action message for that order.|  
|**Reschedule**|When a date change for a supply or demand order causes an imbalance in the order network, the action message **Reschedule** is generated. If there is a one-to-one relationship between demand and supply, an action message is generated to suggest that you move the supply order. If the supply-order covers demand from more than one sales order, the supply order is re-scheduled equal to the date of the first demand.|  
|**Resch. & Chg. Qty.**|If both the dates and quantities of an order change, you must change plans with regard to both. Action messaging gathers both actions in one message, **Resched. and Chg. Qty.**, to ensure that the order network returns to balance.|  
|**Cancel**|If a demand that has been covered on an order-to-order basis is deleted, an action message is generated to cancel the related supply order. If the relationship isn't order-to-order, an action message is generated to change in order to reduce the supply. If through other factors, such as inventory adjustments, a supply order isn't required at the time you generate the action messages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests an action message of **Cancel** in the worksheet.|

# Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central license that allows them to view, modify and act on their business data from any user interface. For all other employees across the organization that only need to occasionally view data, Business Central offers access through Microsoft 365.  

When an organization has both a Dynamics 365 Business Central and Microsoft 365 subscription, administrators can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, and choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. When configured, employees that have a Microsoft 365 license but no [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license can view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.

## Why enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses  

- Unlock master data that every employee across the organization should have access to.

- Empower departments that don’t run on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to self-serve, by accessing key data needed to successfully perform their tasks, eliminating the need for continually requesting data from others.

- Increase collaboration efficacy so that tasks and projects that span across departments complete on time, by eliminating the friction that is typically associated with access denied errors due to licensing.

- Increase team performance so that people can make data-driven decisions that are inclusive of everyone in the group, even if they don’t work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Meet licensing budget targets by assigning licenses that progressively match employee needs, with Microsoft 365 licenses for read-only access, Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member licenses for limited write access, and Dynamics 365 Business Central Essentials or Premium for full write access.

- Improve data security by reducing the need for pasting screen snippets of business data outside of data governance boundaries.

## Use rights

When a person accesses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a Microsoft 365 license, the license entitles the user to read (but not write) [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data through a simplified user interface in Microsoft Teams. This section explains these use rights and limitations that help you plan how to configure and make the most out of this capability. For more information on this license type compared to other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses, consult the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
 
### Client access

Users are entitled to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Microsoft Teams. The following table summarizes which of the different methods of accessing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service are allowed with this license.

## Minimum requirements

This section describes the minimum requirements that must be met for your organization to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, and for individual Microsoft Teams users to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data without a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### Requirements to enable access

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (SaaS).

### Requirements for individual users to access data in Teams

- Data must be accessed using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. Users must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed and must use one of the supported Teams clients. Get a list of Teams clients supported by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

- Users must be internal to the organization, meaning that a user identity originates from the same home tenant where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed and where access is enabled.

# Connecting to Your Business Central Data to Build a Business App Using Power Apps

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data available as a data source in Power Apps.  

> [!TIP]  
> Business Central now offers development and operations support for Power Platform in AL-Go and samples to get you started creating your own apps with Power Apps. These features are currently in preview. To learn more, go to [Business Central and Power Apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-overview) in the developer and IT pro help.

## Prerequisites

You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and with Power Apps.  

## Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power Apps

These steps add a Business Central table, like customers or items, as the data source of a Power Apps app.

1. In your browser, go to [powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), and then sign in.
2. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **+ Create**, and then select **More data sources** on the **Create app** page.
  
   <!-- This step opens Power Apps canavs. On first sign-in, you must specify the country/region.  -->
3. The **Connections** the list shows any existing data connections you have.

   - If there's a **Business Central** connection already, select it, and then select **Create**.

   - If you don't see a Business Central connection, select **+ New connection**, search for and select **Business Central**, and then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, then you must choose the **Business Central (on-premises)** connector.  
  
4. Power Apps connects to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Sign in using the Business Central account name and password. If you aren't an administrator of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you may have to sign in with another account.  
5. Once you've signed in, Power Apps displays a list of *Environments and companies* that are available from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Choose the environment and company that contains the data you want to connect to, such as *PRODUCTION - My Company*.  
6. Next, you're presented with a list of tables that are exposed as part of the API for your environment. Select the table that you want to connect to, and then choose **Connect**.

These so-called tables are exposed as endpoints by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Apps.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include data from other tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your app, then you must work with a developer to define a custom API in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

At this point, you have successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and are ready to begin building your Power App. You can always add more screens and connect to more data. Learn more at [Create a canvas app from a sample in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app).  

When you have designed and built your app, you can share it with your colleagues. For more information, see [Save and publish a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app).  

<!--
## Sample apps to get started

As a preview version, Business Central offers several sample apps that you can use as a starting point for building your own apps that use Business Central data. These sample apps are available in the [Business Central Demos](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos) repo on GitHub. For a quick overview on the apps, go to [Power Apps samples for Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-samples).

## Develop and maintain apps application lifecycle management

As an app developer, you may already be familiar with Business Central AL-Go. AL-Go is set of tools on GiHub that enables you to maintain professional DevOps processes for your Business Central AL projects. AL-Go supports source control and activities, like building, testing, and deploying. As a preview, Business Central now offers an Al-Go version that supports for Power Platform solutions. The preview, for example, includes workflows that let you push and pull Power Platfrom changes to and from enviroments. You can access the tools at [https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go-PTE). For more information, see [Application lifecycle management for Power Apps in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-alm).-->

# Set up approval users

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.

# Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in Microsoft OneDrive

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through Microsoft OneDrive for Business. On most pages with available files, such as the Report Inbox or when files are attached to records, you'll find **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.


:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::


## Open in OneDrive

The **Open in OneDrive** action copies the file to your OneDrive and then opens the file in an application such as Microsoft Excel online, Microsoft Word online, or Microsoft PowerPoint online. 

<!--## Working with different types of files-->

When you choose **Open in OneDrive**, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files and opens them in their online applications, that is, Excel online, Word online and PowerPoint online. 

Using the online versions of these applications, you can annotate, edit, and collaborate with others without leaving the browser.

For other popular file types, such as PDFs, text files, and images, OneDrive provides file viewers that offer features for printing, sharing, and more. If a file can't be viewed in OneDrive, you might be prompted to download it.

## Share

The **Share** action copies the file to your OneDrive so you can see with whom you've already shared it as well as share the file with other people. When you select the **Share** action, the following page opens.

:::image type="content" source="media/share-to-onedrive-dialog-v2.PNG" alt-text="Share file in OneDrive":::

If you're familiar with OneDrive, you may recognize the above-referenced page. You'll see you have two options for sharing the file: **Send link** and **Copy link**.

- **Send link** let's you share the files with specific people. The people you share the file will get an email with a link to the file. The file will also appear in the **Shared** section of their OneDrive. Start by typing the email addresses or contact names in the **Name, group or email field**. Include a message below the  **Name, group or email field**, if you want.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to compose your message in Outlook, select the **Outlook** button. The link will be inserted into a draft email and everyone you entered to share with will be in the **To** list. With this option, you can author emails using all of Outlook's features, including formatting text, adding other attachments, inserting pictures or tables, and adding CC or BCC recipients.

- **Copy link** copies a file link you can use to share the file through applications such as Facebook, Twitter, or email. 

Before you send or copy a file link, set the permission level you want people to have. You can see the current setting under **Send link** or **Copy link**. In most cases, it will be **Anyone with the link can edit**, depending on your administrator's settings. To change the permissions, select the link and make changes on the **Link Settings** page.

The sharing feature in Business Central is based on OneDrive. Learn more about OneDrive sharing and permissions at [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Share** action isn't available in the Business Central app for mobile devices.

## First-time sign in from Business Central

When you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things:

1. Opens the **Please review terms and conditions** page. Read the page, and if you agree with the terms and conditions, select **Agree** to continue.
2. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in OneDrive. 
3. Within the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates a folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a folder for each company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action. 
4. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the company name folder, and then opens the file. 

Then, the next time you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only copies and opens the file. 

## Managing multiple copies of a file

When you choose **Open in OneDrive** or **Share**, the file is copied from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your folder in OneDrive. If you edit the file in OneDrive, that file will be different from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] file. To update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the latest file version, remove the existing file from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and upload the latest copy.

If a file with the same name already exists in OneDrive, you'll be given the following choices:

- **Use existing**

  This option opens or shares the file that's already stored in OneDrive, instead of copying the file from Business Central.
  
- **Replace**
  
  This option replaces the existing file in OneDrive with the file you selected from Business Central. The original file isn't lost&mdash;you can see and restore it using the version history in OneDrive. Learn more at [Restore a previous version of a file stored in OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-a-previous-version-of-a-file-stored-in-onedrive-159cad6d-d76e-4981-88ef-de6e96c93893).

- **Keep both**

  This option keeps the existing file as-is and saves the file you selected from Business Central under a different name. The new name is similar to the existing name, except with a suffix number such  “Items (2).xlsx”.

## About your Business Central folder on OneDrive

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. So you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. 

You can access your OneDrive from the **My Settings** page by choosing the link in the **Cloud Storage** field. Learn more at [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**No. of Outstanding Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-outstanding-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Received Not Invd. Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-received-not-invd-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Purchase Invoices**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-purchase-invoices)

# Managing VAT Rate Changes

VAT rates can change depending on local legislation. Any change in VAT impacts your data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] whether or not the VAT rate is lowered, raised, or removed. VAT is connected to many entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers, vendors, items, resources, item charges, and general ledger accounts. Changes in VAT rates usually happen at a specific date, from which point you will need to have changed the VAT setup, posting groups etc. to make sure new sales orders and purchase orders are created with the new VAT rate.

## Changing VAT rates

The optimal approach to manage a VAT rate change is to fully post and close open orders and other documents before the VAT rate switch date, to make sure these are not impacted by the change. This is the cleanest approach that allows you to start up new orders and documents with the new VAT rate.

The following approach is suggested to manage a VAT rate change

1. Fully post and close open orders, journals and other documents before the switch date. You can wait to after the switch date as long as you do not add new lines and make sure the effective date will be prior the switch date.  
2. Create the new VAT setup.  
3. Make the VAT switch on entities (relevant customers, vendors, items, and so on).  
4. At the VAT rate switch date you create new documents that will use the new rate.  


> [!NOTE]  
> We are currently updating the VAT Rate Change tool. The functionality mentioned below may not match the functionality in your environment. The update will take place before July 1st 2020 and will not be a regular monthly update. Instead, all environments will be updated automatically (hotfix). When this update is complete, this message will no longer appear.  

## The VAT Rate Change tool

The VAT Rate Change tool can assist with conversion of VAT Rates on master data, journals and orders, to some extent. This is useful if you want to convert VAT on master data more easily or if you have orders that you cannot close before the switch date and will be processed over a longer period of time, crossing the VAT rate switch date. There are certain restrictions and limitations in the VAT Rate Change tool that applies.

## Understanding the VAT rate conversion process and limitations

The VAT Rate Change tool performs VAT rate conversions for master data, journals, and orders in different ways. The selected master data and journals will be updated by the new general product posting group or VAT product post group. If an order has been fully or partially shipped, the shipped items will keep the current general product posting group or VAT product posting group. A new order line will be created for the unshipped items and updated to align current and new VAT or general product posting groups. In addition, item charge assignments, configuration templates for items, reservations, and item tracking information will be updated accordingly. 

On order lines, the unit price will be updated for all lines of type Item and Resource, if using prices incl. VAT for the item. For other line types it is possible to decide whether or not the unit price should be updated.

There are a few things that the tool does not convert:

* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments have been posted. These documents are posted using the current VAT rate.  
* Documents that have posted prepayment invoices. For example, you have made or received prepayments on invoices that have not been completed before you use the VAT rate change tool. In this case, there will be a difference between the VAT that is due and the VAT that has been paid in the prepayments when the invoice is completed. The VAT rate change tool will skip these documents and you will have to manually update them.  
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they are partially shipped or received.  
* Drop shipments.
* Special orders. 
* Assembly orders.
* Service contracts.  
* Credit memos.
* Return orders.
* Prices on Items (master data)
* Prices on Sales Prices (master data)
* Business Posting Groups on Customers and Vendors.

### To prepare VAT rate change conversions

Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, you must make the following preparations.

* If you have transactions that use different rates, then they must be separated into different groups either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
* If you create new general ledger accounts, then you must create new general posting groups.  
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible and reduce unposted documents to a minimum.  
* Back up data.

### To set up the VAT rate change tool

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Master Data**, **Journals**, and **Documents** FastTabs, choose a posting group value from the option list for needed fields. For each group you can choose whether to convert VAT product posting groups or general product posting groups, or convert both values if they are available in the master data item. For some areas you can also set a filter to convert only a subset of values, for example, G/L accounts. 
3. On the **Prices Incl. VAT** FastTab, choose which line types on orders for which you want to update unit prices. Unit prices on lines of type Item and Resource will always be updated.

### To set up product posting group conversion

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Rate Change Setup** page, choose either the **VAT Prod. Posting Group Conv.** or **Gen Prod. Posting Group Conv.** action.  
3. In the **From Code** field, enter the current posting group.  
4. In the **To Code** field, enter the new posting group.  

### To perform VAT rate change conversion

You use the VAT rate change tool to manage changes in the standard rate of VAT. You perform VAT and general posting group conversions to change VAT rates and maintain accurate VAT reporting. Depending on your setup, the following changes are made:  

* VAT and general posting groups are converted.  
* Changes are implemented in general ledger accounts, customers, vendors, open documents, journal lines, and so on.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you perform VAT rate change conversion, you can test the conversion. To do so, follow the steps below, but make sure to clear the **Perform Conversion** and **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** check boxes. During test conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is cleared and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is blank. After the conversion is complete, choose **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** to view the results of the test conversion. Verify each entry before you perform the conversion. In particular, verify transactions that use an old VAT rate.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change**, and then choose the **VAT Rate Change Setup** link.  
2. Verify that you have already set up the VAT product posting group conversion or general product posting group conversion.  
3. Choose the **Perform Conversion** check box.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Clear the **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** check box. The check box is automatically selected when the VAT rate change conversion is completed.  

4. Choose the **Convert** action.  
5. After the conversion is complete, choose the **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** action to view the results of the conversion.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After the conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is chosen and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table displays the conversion date.

# Work with general journals

Most financial transactions are posted to the general ledger through documents such as purchase invoices and sales orders. However by posting journal lines, you can also process business activities such as:

* Purchasing
* Payments
* Using recurring journals to post accruals
* Refunding employee expenses

Most journals are based on the general journal, and you can process all transactions on the **General Journals** page. Learn more at [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

For example, you can use post employee expenses for reimbursement. Learn more at [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers journals that are optimized for specific types of transactions, such as the *Payment Journal* for registering payments. Learn more at [Record Payments and Refunds in the Payment Journal](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).  

You use general journals to post financial transactions to general ledger accounts and various other accounts. The other accounts include bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account. The entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in the journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to entries on individual accounts, where it can't be changed. You can, however, unapply posted entries, and you can post reversing or correcting entries. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]  

## Add context to general journal transactions

When you create a journal, you can add links that give context to its transactions. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the links to the posted journal and ledger entries the journal creates. For example, providing links can make life easier for your auditor. If you keep images of your expense receipts on your company's Sharepoint site, you can add links to the files. When you post the journal to submit your expenses, your auditor can quickly get to the receipt files.

## Use journal templates and batches

There are several general journal templates. Each journal template is represented by a dedicated page with particular functions and the fields that are required to support those functions, such as the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page to process bank payments and the **Payment Journals** page to pay your vendors or reimburse your employees. Learn more at [Make Payments](payables-make-payments.md) and [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md).

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. For example, you can define your own journal batch for the payment journal that has your personal layout and settings. The following tip is an example of how to personalize a journal.

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page, then the **Amount** field on, for example, general journal lines for the same document number is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the document. Learn more at [Letting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can add or remove fields in journals by personalizing them. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### Validating general journal batches

You can turn on a background check that helps prevent delays when posting. The check notifies you when a mistake in the financial journal you're working on will prevent you from posting the journal. On the **General Journal Batches** page, you can choose **Background Error Check** to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate finance journals, such as general or payment journals, while you're working on them.

When you enable the validation, the **Check Document** or **Journal Check** FactBoxes show issues in the current line and the whole batch. Validation happens when you load a finance journal batch, and when you choose another journal line. The **Issues total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found, and you can choose it to open an overview of the issues.

You can use the **Show Lines with Issues** and **Show All Lines** actions to toggle between journal lines that do or don't have issues. The **Journal Line Details** FactBox provides quick overview and access to data from journal lines, such as the G/L account, customer, or vendor, and the posting setup for specific accounts.

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]  

## Understanding main accounts and balancing accounts

If you set up default balancing accounts for the journal batches on the **General Journals** page, the balancing account is filled in automatically when you fill in the **Account No.** field. Otherwise, fill in both the **Account No.** and **Bal. Account No.** fields manually. A positive amount in the **Amount** field is debited to the main account and credited to the balancing account. A negative amount is credited to the main account and debited to the balancing account.

> [!NOTE]  
> VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account, so they can use different VAT percentage rates.

## Work with recurring journals

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. For example, transactions for expenses such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, and heat. Using recurring journals lets you post fixed and variable amounts, and specify automatic reversal entries for the day after the posting date. Allocation keys let you divide the recurring entries among various accounts. Learn more at [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).

With a recurring journal, you create the entries that you post regularly only one time. For example, the accounts, dimensions, dimension values, and so on, stay in the journal after posting. If changes are needed, you can make them each time you post.

### Recurring Method field

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how to treat the amount on the journal line after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time you post the line, you can let the amount remain. If you'll use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time you post, you can delete the amount after posting.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|F Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting. Lines with amounts of zero remain in the journal, but aren't posted. You can update the amount in a later run.  |
|V Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting.|
|B Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line in the Gen. Jnl. Allocation table. The balance on the account is set to zero. Remember to fill in the **Allocation %** field on the **Allocations** page. For more information, see [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).|
|RF Reversing Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RV Reversing Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RB Reversing Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line on the **Allocations** page. The balance on the account is set to zero, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|BD Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to be used to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. As an alternative, choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|
|RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's reversing balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to use to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. You can also choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT fields can be filled in on either the recurring journal line or on the allocation journal line but not on both. That is, they can be filled in on the **Allocations** page only if the corresponding lines in the recurring journal are not filled in.

### Recurring Frequency field

This date formula field determines how often to post the entry on the journal line, and it must be filled in. Learn more at [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

#### Examples

If the journal line must be posted every month, enter **1M**. After every posting, the date in the **Posting Date** field will be updated to the same date in the next month.

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month, you can take one of the following actions:

* Post the first entry on the last day of a month by entering 1D+1M-1D (1 day + 1 month - 1 day). With this formula, the posting date is calculated correctly regardless of how many days there are in the month.

* Post the first entry on any day of the month by entering 1M+CM. With this formula, the posting date will be after one full month + the remaining days of the current month.

### Expiration Date field

This field determines the date on which the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after this date.

The advantage of using the Expiration Date field is that the line isn't deleted from the journal immediately. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future.

If the field is blank, the line is posted every time until you delete it from the journal.

### Allocating recurring journal amounts to several accounts

On the **Recurring General Journals** page, you can choose the **Allocations** action to specify how to allocate amounts on the recurring journal line to several accounts and dimensions. Allocation acts as balancing account line for the recurring journal line.

Like a recurring journal, you enter an allocation one time and it stays in the allocation journal after posting. You don't need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use allocation accounts in journal batches that have an approval workflow for creating journal lines.

If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance** or **Reversing Balance**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are disregarded when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, only one reversing entry is created.

> [!NOTE]
> If you allocate a recurring journal line that contains a dimension value code, don't enter the same code on the **Allocations** page. If you do, the dimension values will be incorrect.  

To allocate recurring journal amounts based on dimensions, set the **Recurring Method** field to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**. If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are considered when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, reversing entries are created that match the number of dimension value combinations that the balance is comprised of. If you allocate account balance through a recurring journal that contains a dimension value code, remember to use **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension** to ensure that the dimension values are correctly balanced or reversed from the source account.  

For example, your company has a couple of business units and a handful of departments that your controllers set up as dimensions. To speed up the purchase invoice entry process, you decide to require the accounts payable clerks to enter only business unit dimensions. Since each business unit has specific allocation keys for the Department dimension, such as based on the number of employees, you can use the **BD Balance by Dimension** or **RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension** recurring methods to reallocate expenses for each business unit to the right departments based on the allocation keys.  

> [!NOTE]
> Dimensions that you set on allocation lines are not automatically calculated, and you must specify which dimension values must be set on the allocation accounts. In case you want to preserve the link between the source account dimension and the allocation account dimension, we recommend that you use the [Cost Accounting](finance-about-cost-accounting.md) capabilities instead.

#### Example: Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments

You pay rent monthly, so you enter the amount on the cash account on a recurring journal line. On the **Allocations** page, you can use the Department dimension to divide the expense among several departments. For example, according to the number of square feet that each department occupies. The calculation is based on the allocation percentage on each line. You can allocate in different ways:

* Enter different accounts on different allocation lines to divide rental expense among several accounts.
* Enter the same account but use different dimension value codes for the Department dimension on each line.

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

### Calculate the reversal date

When using recurring general journals to post accruals at the end of a period, it's important to have full control over reversal entries. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field lets you control the date that reversal entries are posted when reversal recurring methods are used.

#### Example

Accruals are typically posted with **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Balance** recurring methods on the journal line. The posting date of the posted amount on the account on journal line is calculated using the recurring frequency. The posting date for the balancing entry is calculated using the **Reversal Date Calculation** field, as follows:

* If the field is blank, the balancing entry will be posted the next day.
* If the field contains a date formula (for example, **5D** for five days), the balancing entry is posted with a posting date calculated using the reversal date calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field is not available on the **Recurring General Journals** page. To use the field, you must add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Work with standard journals

When you create journal lines that you know you're likely to create again later, you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal. The same applies for item journals and general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals might not contain all of the fields you want to include in the resulting ledger entries. For example, if you're using a standard general journal to register a payment, the ledger entries won't contain the Payment Method Code field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures refer to the item journal, but the information also applies to the general journal.

### To save a standard journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter one or more journal lines.
3. Select the journal lines that you want to reuse.
4. Choose the **Save as Standard Journal** action.
5. In the **Save as Standard Item Journal** request page, define a new or existing standard item journal that the lines should be saved in.

    If you have one or more standard item journals, and you want to replace one of them with the new set of item journal lines, in the **Code** field, select the item journal.
6. Choose **OK** to verify that you want to replace the content of the existing standard item journal.
7. To save the values in the **Unit Amount** field of the standard item journal, choose the **Save Unit Amount** field.
8. To save the values in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Save Quantity** field.
9. Choose **OK** to save the standard item journal.

When you save the standard item journal, the Item Journal page displays so you can post it.

### To reuse a standard journal

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals don't always have the same fields as general journals. When you use the Get Standard Journals action to copy the fields to the general journal, the general journal might have less information than if you created it manually. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Get Standard Journals** action.
3. To review a standard item journal before you select it for reuse, choose the **Show Journal** action.

    Changes you make in a standard item journal are implemented right away, and they'll be there next time you open or reuse the standard item journal. Be sure that the change is important enough to generally apply. Otherwise, make the specific change in the item journal after the standard item journal lines are added. See step 4.
4. On the **Standard Item Journals** page, select the standard item journal to reuse, and then choose **OK**.

    The item journal contains the lines you saved. If the item journal already has lines, the new lines appear after them.

    If you didn't turn on the **Save Unit Amount** toggle when you saved the journal, the **Unit Amount** field on lines added from the standard journal contain the value from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you turned on the **Save Unit Amount** or **Save Quantity** toggles when you saved the journal, make sure the new values are correct before you post the item journal.
    >
    > If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you don't want to post, you can adjust it to the current value of the item.

5. Select the item journal lines you want to adjust, and then choose the **Recalculate Unit Amount** action. This action updates the Unit Amount field with the current unit cost of the item.
6. Choose the **Post** action.

## To renumber document numbers in journals

To avoid posting errors caused by the document number, you can use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action before you post a journal.

In all journals that are based on the general journal, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines or the same document number for related journal lines.

If the **No. Series** field on the journal batch is filled, then the posting function in general journals requires that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines be in sequential order. Just choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action, and relevant **Document No.** fields are then updated. If related journal lines are grouped by document number before you used the function, they remain grouped, but might be assigned a different document number.  

This function also works on filtered views.

Renumbering document numbers respects related applications, such as a payment application made from the document on the journal line to a vendor account. Accordingly, the **Applies-to ID** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields are updated on the ledger entries.

### To renumber documents in journals

The following procedure is based on the **General Journals** page, but applies to all other journals that are based on the general journal, such as the **Payment Journals** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. When you're ready to post the journal, choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action.

Values in the **Document No.** field are changed, where required, so that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines are in sequential order. After documents are renumbered, you can post the journal.

# Create contacts

When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When you convert a contact to a customer, vendor, or employee, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data synchronizes going forward.

## To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).
>
>Also, you must also have at least one template set up for each of them. For example, to create a customer from a contact, you must have a customer template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronize data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritize if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

## To remove a link between a contact and an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronizes.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, employees, and bank accounts

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronize them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronization between contacts and customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## To view which customer, vendor, employee, or bank account a contact is related to

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a contact, choose the **Related Information** action, and then choose the **Customer/Vendor/Bank Account/Employee** action.

# Suggest number series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how you can quickly generate number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with assistance from Copilot.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The suggest number series feature is activated. An administrator must complete this task. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## About number series suggestions with Copilot

For each company you set up in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must assign unique identifiers to things like:

- General ledger accounts
- Customer and vendor accounts
- Invoices and other documents

Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

By letting you use natural language or structured input, Copilot can reduce the time it takes to set up number series and make it easier to maintain them. For example, when you need to update year or month-based numbering for many draft and posted documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Review the suggestions and refine your prompt

You can set up number series for one or more specific entities, such as items, or one or more feature areas (modules), such as Inventory, Finance, Sales, and Purchasing, and so on.

For specific entities, such as purchase orders, Copilot might also suggest blanket purchase orders and purchase return orders.

For feature areas, Copilot looks at the fields on the **Numbering** FastTab on the related setup page. For example, for Inventory, it looks at the FastTab on the **Inventory Setup** page. For Sales and Purchasing, it looks at the FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables** and **Purchases & Payables** pages. However, it also looks at related entities, which means it might suggest series for entities that aren't on the setup page. For example, when you create a series for Warehouse Management, Copilot might suggest a series for items.

We recommend that you carefully review the results and adjust your prompt to exclude unwanted series. For example, both the Warehouse and Inventory areas might suggest series for items. To avoid a conflict, you can exclude items in your prompt for one of those areas.

## Generate number series

Copilot can help you create and update number series on the **No. Series** page. The **Generate** action opens the **Generate No. Series with Copilot** dialog where you can enter a prompt.

To help you write the prompt, the Prompt Guide :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-guide-icon.png" alt-text="Show the Prompt Guide icon."::: button provides sets of prompts that you can use as-is, or as inspiration.

- Create entirely new number series.
- Change and update numbering in existing series.
- Create a new number series for the next year.

After you enter your prompt and choose **Generate**, Copilot creates proposals for one or more number series. You can review the proposals in the **No. Series Proposals** view. You can remove the proposals that you don't like, and edit the ones you do. When you're ready, you can choose **Keep it** to add or update a proposal. In addition, Copilot updates various setup pages with the number series you decided to keep.

## Examples of prompts

|Intent  |Prompt  |
|---------|---------|
|Create a number series that includes a year. For accountants, including a year on numbers for posted documents can make it easier to find hard copies in folders.     |Create contract credit memo number series. Make sure it includes the last two digits of the current year.         |
|Maintain number series and prepare for next year.     | Set up a contract credit memo number series in the service management module for the next year.        |
|Create number series in a completely empty company. This is where Copilot can save your hours, or even days, in new implementations.     | Create numbers series for the new company. Make sure all posted documents contain the last to digits of the current year.        |

# Using key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way of measuring whether or not you’re delivering on your objectives.

## Why KPIs matter

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know if your business is on the right path—or if you should change course to avoid losing valuable time and money. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

## Get started identifying your KPIs

So how do you begin to identify the KPIs that are important to your business? Start by clarifying your strategic objectives—collectively or by department.

These goals help you identify which KPIs matter for your company. Picking KPIs that are relevant depends entirely on these objectives and the ability you have to measure your performance against them.

Next, identify the KPI targets that you’re working toward, and how you measure them. Keep in mind that targets can be short and long-term.

Talk to your team and encourage open dialogue about the KPIs and their targets. Are they too aggressive? Too easy? Targets should be challenging but achievable. You should explore the activities and tactics your company uses to achieve them. Take time to understand your current state, so you have a starting point for your KPI.

## Get to know the different types of KPIs

Identifying which KPIs you should track becomes easier when you have a better understanding of the types of KPIs that are most commonly used to measure progress.

- Quantitative KPIs are all about measurable facts that can be represented with a number. Think stats, percentages, and dollar signs.
- Qualitative KPIs involve human interpretations and can’t be quantified with numbers. Think opinions, feelings, and experiences.
- Lagging KPIs measure what happened in the past to predict success or failure. Think of looking back at what you accomplished, or where you struggled.
- Leading KPIs measure performance to predict future success and long-term trends. Think of looking forward to where you’re headed.
- Leading and lagging KPIs are commonly used together. Along with quantitative and qualitative KPIs, they’re a good place to start.

For each KPI that you choose to track, assign an owner and agree on tracking frequency. Whatever KPIs you decide to track, using a KPI platform or tool is key for collaborating with your team on KPI definitions. By collectively defining each KPI, then capturing contextual data and unifying it into a single view, you enable spot-on, real-time actions.

## KPI reporting

KPI reports take the information presented on the KPI dashboard to a new level. They go deeper into the data to pull out more detailed insights and analysis.

A KPI report helps stakeholders and team members identify trends or bottlenecks over a specific time period, so that they’re able to make better decisions. Reporting subjects could include:

- Insights into the company’s day-to-day operations.
- Financial health of the company against targeted KPIs.
- Notable trends or patterns presented by the data.
- Deeper analysis of the data to assist with strategic decision-making.

To create your KPI report, first determine your audience and the objective for the report. For example, you might want to show company stakeholders Q3 progress toward your revenue target. Make sure that all the KPIs featured in your report point back to that central theme.

Other considerations for creating your KPI reports include:

- Explore KPI report templates that might already be included in your KPI tool or platform.
- Set a cadence for reporting frequency.
- Decide whether your report is static or interactive, for more dynamic drill-downs into data.
- Present only the relevant KPIs so you don’t overload the report with KPIs that don’t map back to the reporting - goals.
- Make sure your reporting is clear, easy to understand, and actionable for the intended audience.

## Tools for implementing KPIs

The following table links to articles about how to use business intelligence and reporting tools with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data to implement KPIs.

| [Analyze financial statements with Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md) |
| Integrate external business intelligence tools with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].| [External Business Intelligence Tools](reports-external-analysis.md) |

## KPI best practices

To help you successfully harness the power of KPIs, here are a few tips to get you started.

Identify KPIs:

- Only pick KPIs that align to your specific goals. It's difficult to match KPIs to unclear objectives.
- Use different KPIs for the same goals if they stretch across departments. For example, the marketing department has different KPIs than the sales team.
- Make sure that for whatever KPIs you pick, there’s a core team responsible for defining them.

Monitoring KPIs:

- Explore the different dashboards, visualization charts, and templates available in your KPI tool or platform. Select the right ones for your goals.
- Make sure to include starting data for comparison, so that your dashboard shows a true representation of company performance and progress over time.
- Determine a cadence for monitoring and acting on KPIs. Are KPI dashboards monitored daily or weekly? Do actions only come after reporting or are stakeholders and/or team members empowered to adjust tactics along the way?
- Be sure you have simple, end-to-end data protection for data dashboards, with controls for sharing outside the organization.

## Common KPI mistakes

Avoid these common KPI mistakes:

- Selecting KPIs that aren’t key to your strategic goals. While it’s smart to track your relevant business metrics, not all of your metrics are worthy of KPI status.
- Adopting poorly defined or vague KPIs. Collaborate with your team to define the KPIs with specific details on how they're measured. Having everyone onboard makes it easier to meet your goals.
- Setting lofty or unrealistic KPI targets. It’s better to set more realistic targets based on historical data, resources, and current tactics. Consider focusing on a specific timeframe or set short- and long-term targets.
- Tracking KPIs without owners. Accountability matters, not just for the results but also for the process. Each KPI should have an owner responsible for monitoring, reporting, analysis, and action.
- Failing to take action on your KPIs. Whether you’re meeting your goals or falling behind, KPIs are tools to help you make better decisions. So don’t track just for tracking’s sake—take action.

# Make payments with the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension or SEPA credit transfer

On the **Payment Journals** page, you can process payments to your vendors by exporting a file together with the payment information from the journal lines. You can then upload the file to your electronic bank where the related money transfers are processed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

 To enable SEPA credit transfers, you must first set up a bank account, a vendor, and the general journal batch that the payment journal is based on. You then prepare payments to vendors by automatically filling the **Payment Journals** page with due payments with specified posting dates.  

After you verify that the bank processed the payments, you can post the payment journal lines.  

## Setting up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension

Activate the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to:

* Convert bank statement files to a format that you can import.
* Convert your exported payment files to the format that your bank requires.

For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

## Setting up SEPA credit transfer

From the **Payment Journals** page, you can export payments to a file for upload to your electronic bank for processing of the related money transfers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.  

To be able export of a bank file format that isn't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process payment electronically by exporting payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the bank account in question to handle the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up vendor cards to process payments by exporting files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up the related general journal batch to enable payment export from the **Payment Journals** page  
* Connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods  

> [!NOTE]
> Business Central supports both SEPA format CT pain.001.001.03 and CT pain.001.001.09. You can choose any format on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

> [!TIP]
> This article applies to the generic version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In your country or region, additional required fields may have been added to the various pages. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

3. On the **Pmt. Export Line Definitions** page, select the code that you specified in the **Code** field on the **Line Definitions** FastTab in step 4 in the "To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file" section in the [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md) procedure.  

## Preparing the payment journal

Fill the payment journal with lines for due payments to vendors, with the option to insert posting dates based on the due date of the related purchase documents. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## Exporting payments to a bank file

When you're ready to make payments to your vendors, or reimbursements to your employees, you can export a file with the payment information on the lines on the **Payment Journals** page. You can then upload the file to your bank to process the related money transfers.

In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension is available. In North American versions, the same extension can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can export payment files from the payment journal, you must specify the electronic format for the involved bank account, and you must enable the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md) and [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md). In addition, you must select the **Allow Payment Export** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

Use the **Credit Transfer Registers** page to view the payment files that exported from the payment journal. From this page, you can also re-export payment files if there were technical errors or file changes. Note, however, that exported EFT files aren't shown in this page and can't be re-exported.  

### To export payments to a bank file

The following steps describe how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. For more information, see [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using EFT, you must select either **Electronic Payment** or **Electronic Payment–IAT** in the **Bank Payment Type** field. Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** and **Vendor Bank Account Card** pages. You will be informed about wrong or missing setup values as you try to export the file.
    >
    > The EFT feature can only be used for bank accounts in the local currency. It cannot be used with a foreign currency, indicated by a value in the **Currency Code** field. (Blank field value means local currency.)

3. After you fill in all payment journal lines, choose the **Export** action.
4. On the **Export Electronic Payments** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    Error messages show in the **Payment File Errors** FactBox, where you can also choose an error message to access more details. You must resolve all errors before you can export the payment file.

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, a common error message states that the bank account number does not have the length that your bank requires. To avoid or resolve the error, you must remove the value in the **IBAN** field on the **Bank Account Card** page and then, in the **Bank Account No.** field, enter a bank account number in the format that your bank requires.

5. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you are using EFT, save the resulting vendor remittance form as a Word document or select to have it emailed directly to the vendor. The payments are now added to the **Generate EFT File** page from where you can generate multiple payment orders together to save transmission cost. For more information, see the following steps.
6. On the **Payment Journals** page, choose the **Generate EFT File** action.

    On the **Generate EFT File** page, the **Lines** FastTab shows all EFT payments that you exported from the payment journal for a bank account but aren't yet generated.
7. Choose the **Generate EFT File** action to export one file for all the EFT payments.
8. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

The bank payment file is exported to the location you specified. You can upload it to your electronic bank account and make the actual payments. Then you can post the exported payment journal lines.

### To plan when to post exported payments

If you don't want to post a payment journal line for an exported payment, you can just delete the journal line. For example, because you're waiting for confirmation that the bank processed the transaction. Later, when you create a payment journal line to pay the remaining amount, the **Total Exported Amount** field shows how much of the payment amount was already exported. Also, you can find detailed information about the exported total by choosing the **Credit Transfer Reg. Entries** button to see details about exported payment files.

If you don't want to post payments until the bank confirms they're processed, you can:

* In a payment journal with suggested payment lines, you can sort on either the **Exported to Payment File** column or the **Total Exported Amount** and then delete payment suggestions for open invoices for which payments were already made.
* On the **Suggest Vendor Payments** page, where you specify which payments to insert in the payment journal, you can select the **Skip Exported Payments** checkbox if you don't want to insert journal lines for payments that were already exported.

To see information about exported payments, choose the **Payment Export History** action.

### To re-export payments to a bank file

You can re-export payment files from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Before you delete or post payment journal lines, you can also re-export the payment file from the **Payment Journals** page by exporting it again. If you delete or post the payment journal lines after your export, you can re-export the same payment file from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Select the line for the batch of credit transfers that you want to re-export, and then use the **Reexport Payments to File** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> Exported EFT files are not shown on the **Credit Transfer Registers** page and cannot be re-exported.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Credit Transfer Registers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a payment export that you want to re-export, and then choose the **Reexport Payment to File** action.

## Posting the payments

After your bank processes the electronic payment, post the payments. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

# The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries Extension
Use the Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension to round depreciation and acquisition amounts in fixed asset ledger entries to whole numbers. For example, to round an amount of 30,000.44 to 30,000. Typical causes of rounding issues are data migration, suddenly starting to post amounts to the general ledger, or customizations you've made to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension is pre-installed and ready to go. If you remove the extension, but want to install it again, you can find it on AppSource.

## Troubleshooting Fixed Asset Ledger Entries
When you open the **Fixed Asset Card** page for the first time, the **FA Ledger Entries Scan** job queue entry is scheduled to monitor amounts every Sunday. If it finds amounts that you might want to round, a notification will display the next time you open the Fixed Asset Card page. The notification provides a **See more** option that opens the **FA Ledger Entries with Rounding Issues** page, which lists the entries with amounts that you might want to round. To round the amounts, choose the entries, and then choose the **Accept Selection** action. You can use the **Find entries with issues** action to update the list with new issues that occurred after the job queue entry ran on the previous Sunday.

# Audit changes to financial reporting

Financial reporting helps you gather insights into the financial data in your chart of accounts (COA). This article explains ways to monitor changes to your financial report definitions, and how to control access to financial reports.

## Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to the definitions for financial reports. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for financial report definitions and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Report Definition       | 88  |
| Row Definition          | 84  |
| Column Definition       | 333 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]

## Get notified when financial report definitions change

To add an extra layer of security around your financial report definitions, you can monitor changes to their fields and get an email when someone changes a value. 

To learn more, go to [Get notified when system setup change](across-setup-auditing.md#get-notified-when-system-setup-change)

## Analyze changes to financial report definitions

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to your setup](across-setup-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-your-setup).

## Permissions to view or edit financial reports

The following table lists the permission sets that control whether you can view or edit financial reports and their report definitions.

| Access   | Permission set |
|------------------------| ---------------------- |
| View financial reports. | **Account Schedules - View** |

# Capacity Variance (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Capacity Variance** report gives an overview of the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis. This report helps you identify areas where costs are overrunning. You can optimize production processes, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Capacity Variance Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track and manage capacity costs for production operations. By analyzing the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis, you can find areas where costs are overrunning and take corrective action.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the performance of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual capacity costs against the expected costs, you can quickly uncover deviations. For example, the report might show that the cost of raw materials increased significantly. You can investigate whether the issue is due to supplier pricing or production inefficiencies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Capacity Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Capacity Cost Amt. Deviation %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-deviation)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Amount](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-amount)
- [Capacity Cost Amt. (Actual)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-actual)
- [Capacity Cost Amt. Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-variance)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order Routing Line
- Production Order
- Capacity Ledger Entry
  
## Try the report

# Power BI Sales app semantic model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The semantic model in the Power BI sales app is organized in a [Star Schema Model](/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview).

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices, and posted credit memos from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The dimension tables provide more context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.

## Fact tables

Fact tables store transactional data and support summarizations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and more. There are two fact tables in the Power BI Sales app:

- [Sales](#sales)
- [Sales Budget](#sales-budget)

### Sales

The app uses data from the following tables:

- Value Entries
- Sales Lines

Sales lines are broken down into **Shipped Not Invoiced** and **Outstanding Sales Lines**. Use the **Source Type** field to filter on these sources.

# Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## To create an opportunity from a salesperson

# Register Employees

To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first add each employee by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page.

## Adding new employees

You can add new employees manually, by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a templates for different types of employee profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new employees, and helps ensure that the information is correct each time. If you create templates for more than one type of employee, you can choose the template to use when you add an employee. If you create only one template it will be used for all new employees. After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected employees. To create a template, you fill in the information that you want to reuse on the Employee Card page, and then save it as a template.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Employee Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping employee records up-to-date can simplify personnel-related tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the Employee Card page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab on the **Employee Card** page. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

## To set up an employee

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Employee Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To insert a picture of an employee

If you have a picture of an employee, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. In the **Employee Picture** FactBox, choose the drop-down button, and then choose **Import**.
4. On the **Select a picture to upload** page, then do one of the following steps to upload the picture file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The picture is inserted in the **Employee Picture** FactBox.

## To register various information about an employee

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employees’ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. Choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
4. **In the Alternate Address List** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat step 4 for each alternate address.

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and see what is happening on the back end. By integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can give your sales people that insight. The integration lets people view information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. For more information, see [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the process of integrating the online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For information about on-premises configuration, see [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

## Integrate through Dataverse

To make it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you're integrating for the first time, you must do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## Integration settings that are specific to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration

Integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] happens through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and many standard settings and tables are provided. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following sections list those settings.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in Sales

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed, you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. The following security roles are deployed:

* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> * You must have Read permissions for the Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_connection) table.
> * You must have Read, Write, and Delete permissions for the Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Connection settings in the setup guide

You can use an assisted setup guide to quickly set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as coupling between records.

1. Choose **Setup and Extensions**, and then choose **Assisted Setup**.
2. Choose **Set up the Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Optionally, there are advanced settings that can enhance security and enable more capabilities. The following table describes the advanced settings.  

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **Import Dynamics 365 Sales Solution** | Install and configure the integration solution in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. |

This setting lets users open the records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, an account or product. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records open in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|**Automatically Synchronize Item Availability**|Specifies that the item availability job queue must be scheduled. The job queue runs every 30 minutes, and updates the availability of the coupled items.|
|**Dynamics 365 SDK Version**|If you're integrating with an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], use the Dynamics 365 software development kit (also referred to as Xrm) to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The version that you select must be compatible with the SDK version that is used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. This version equal to or newer than the version used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

In addition to these settings, enter the following settings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **Sales Order Integration is Enabled** | Enable users to submit sales orders and activated quotes in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and then view and process them in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

|**Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders**|Synchronize sales orders in both directions. To learn more about this option, go to [Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders](#single-and-bi-directional-synchronization-of-sales-orders).|
<!--
### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through Dataverse requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
### Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders

When you set up your integration, there are options that control the direction in which you synchronize sales orders, and how you submit them.

The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option lets you synchronize sales orders from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. For example, if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can archive the sales document and create a new document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same is true for changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when prices, tax amounts, or expected shipment dates change, the changes synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Bidirectional synchronization helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of sales orders.

For bidirectional synchronization, you make sales orders available for synchronization when you change their status to **Submitted** in Sales. When you set that status, you can no longer change information on the order's lines. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**. If there's a mistake, you can revert the order to **Open** (in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) or **Active** (in Sales), and then add or delete lines to correct the mistake, and submit the order again.

> [!TIP]
> When you enable the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a record on the **Sales Order Archives** page when you post or change information on an order. For example, the archived versions can be useful for exploring an order's history.

The **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option synchronizes only from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For this option, you use the **Submit** action in Sales to make orders available for synchronization. When you do, you can no longer change any information on the order. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**.

To use this option, you must provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, see [Handle Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** and **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** options are mutually exclusive. You can't use both options at the same time.

For both options, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows all sales orders with the **Submitted** status on the **Orders - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** page.

### Standard Sales entity mapping for synchronization

Entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as sales orders. To work with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|--|--|--|--|
| Unit of Measure | Unit Group | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] |  |
| Item | Product | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | Sales contact filter: **Product Type** is **Sales Inventory** |

> [!NOTE]
> The mappings for the Item Unit of Measure, Resource Unit of Measure, and Unit Group tables are available only if your administrator has turned on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Items and Resources with Products in Different Units of Measure](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronize-items-and-resources-with-products-with-different-units-of-measure).

## Synchronize items and resources with products with different units of measure

Businesses often produce or purchase the items in one unit of measure, and then sell them in another. To synchronize items that use multiple units of measure, you must turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. 

When you turn on the feature update, a new Unit Group table is created and assigned to each item and resource in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tables let you map the Unit Group, Item Unit of Measure, and Resource Unit of Measure tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the Dynamics 365 Sales Unit Group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following image shows the mappings.

:::image type="content" source="media/unit group 1.png" alt-text="Table mappings for unit groups":::

You can create multiple units of measure for each unit group, and assign the groups to products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize the products with items and resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually couple item units of measure or resource units of measure with a unit group. When you do, if the unit group for the item or resource isn't coupled to a unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example, because the unit group didn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

### Map items and resources to products

When you turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, the following happens:

* New mappings are created for items and resources.
* Existing mappings are deleted. <!--which mappings?-->
* A data upgrade creates unit groups for items and resources.

To use the new mappings, you must synchronize unit groups, item unit of measure, and resource unit of measures. You must also resynchronize items and resources. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] does not allow you to change a unit group for a product. Therefore, you must retire your products and uncouple the items and resources, and then synchronize by creating new products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. 

The following steps describe the steps to start mapping unit groups:

1. Be sure that products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] aren't coupled with items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they are, go to the **Items** and/or **Resources** pages and use the filter options to select the coupled records. Then choose the **Dynamics 365 Sales** action, and select **Uncouple**. This action schedules a background job to uncouple the records. While the job is running, you can check its status by using the **Synchronization Log** action. For more information, see [Coupling and Synchronizing](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md). 
2. Because new products are created in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with new unit groups, to avoid duplicate names, do one of the following steps:

  * Rename your products, and then retire them in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Retire products (Sales Hub)](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/retire-product). To bulk edit your products in Microsoft Excel, sign in to Power Apps, choose your environment, go to the **Product** table, and then choose the **Data** tab. Clear any filters that are applied. In the **Data** group, choose the **Edit Data in Excel** action. Add a prefix or suffix to the coupled products, and then retire them.
    * Retire your products and delete them. 

3. Follow these steps to synchronize **Unit Groups**, **Unit of Measures**, **Items**, and **Resources**:
    1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page.
    2. Use the **Run Full Synchronization** action to open the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.
    3. For the **ITEM UOM**, **RESOURCE UOM**, AND **UNIT GROUP** mappings, choose the **Recommend Full Synchronization** action.
    4. Choose the **Sync All** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For mappings that have not yet been fully synchronized, this action will fully synchronize them. To prevent those mappings from synchronizing, delete the mappings from the page. This only removes them from the current full synchronization, and does not delete the mappings.
    
5. Choose the **ITEM-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the items in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the item.
6. Choose the **RESOURCE-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the resources in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the resources.

### Synchronization rules

The following table lists the rules that control the synchronization between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These rules are in addition to rules defined for Dataverse, which also apply. For more information, see [Standard Entity Mapping](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to data in  that were made by the integration user account are not synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you do not change data while using that account. For more information, see [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

|Table|Rule|
|-----|----|
|Units of Measure|Units of measure are synchronized with unit groups in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. There can only be one unit of measure defined in the unit group.|
|Items|When it synchronizes items with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a price list in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To avoid synchronization errors, you shouldn't modify this price list manually.|
|Resources|Resources are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products that have product type Service.|
|Customer Price Groups|Customer price groups are synchronized with Sales price lists.|
|Sales Prices|Sales prices that have sales type Customer Price Group and have a sales code defined are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] price list lines|
|Opportunities|Opportunities are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] opportunities. The Salesperson Code value defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|Posted Sales Invoices|Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it's better to synchronize all other tables that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled table in Sales.|
|Sales Orders|When you enable sales order integration, when you release sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that were created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] they synchronize with sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all tables involved with the order. For example, sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

### Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration

The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. There are more jobs available from Dataverse. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](./admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. UNITOFMEASURE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
2. RESOURCE-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
3. ITEM-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
4. CUSTPRCGRP-PRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
5. SALESPRC-PRODPRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
6. POSTEDSALESINV-INV - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.

## Connect to on-premises versions of Business Central 2019 release wave 1 and Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

The Microsoft Power Platform team [announced](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse) that it's deprecating the Office 365 authentication type. If you're using a version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises that's earlier than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 1, you must use the OAuth authentication type to connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] online. The steps in this section describe how to connect the following product versions:

* Business Central 2019 release wave 1
* Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

### Prerequisites

* You must have a Microsoft Azure subscription. A trial account works for application registration.
* [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is configured to use one of the following authentication types:

   * Office 365 (legacy)

# Design details: Non-deductible VAT

Non-deductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser, but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, you must contact the local tax authorities in your country or region to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible. Even when you know that a specific percentage of the VAT isn't deductible, there are different models for handling non-deductible amounts as they are related to **items** and **fixed assets**.

## Prerequisites for using non-deductible VAT

To use and post non-deductible VAT, follow these steps.

1. On the **VAT Setup** page, select **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to enable the feature.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select which VAT posting groups can use non-deductible VAT.

## Examples

For the following examples, non-deductible VAT is enabled, and the following setup is completed:

- The **VAT Product Posting Group** field is set to **NDVAT**.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup** page:

    - **NDVAT** is set as the VAT product posting group, and **DOMESTIC** is set as the VAT business posting group.
    - The **VAT Identifier** value must be unique.
    - The **VAT %** field is set to **25**.
    - The **Allow Non-deductible VAT** field is set to **Allow**.
    - The **Non-deductible VAT %** field is set to **100**.
    - The **VAT Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**.
    - Only the sales VAT account and purchase VAT account are configured.

All the examples use items and fixed assets where the VAT product posting group is **NDVAT**.

### Items

A new item has **NDVAT** set as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Value Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Item Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Item Cost isn't enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,000.00 | 1 |

#### Use for Item Cost is enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,250.00 | 1 |

### Fixed assets

A new fixed asset has the acquisition cost account set to use **NDVAT** as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Fixed Asset Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost isn't enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost is enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 250.00 | 0.00 |

# Manufacturing

> [!NOTE]
> The features this article describes are available only if you have the **Premium** experience. To learn more, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

When demand is planned for and the materials are issued according to production BOMs, production operations can start in the sequence defined by the production order routing.  

An important part of production, from a system point of view, is to post production output to report progress and to update inventory with the finished items. You can post output manually, by filling in and posting journal lines after production operations. Or, it can post automatically with the use of backward flushing. In that case, material consumption is automatically posted along with output when the production order changes to finished.  

As an alternative to the batch journal for output posting for multiple production orders, you can use the **Production Journal** page to post consumption and/or output for one production order line.

There are a few things to set up before you can start production. For example, work centers, routings, and production BOMs. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Manufacturing](production-configure-production-processes.md).

# Set up general fixed assets information

Before you can manage fixed assets (FA), you must set up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, and journal templates and batches to post and reclassify fixed assets. Also, define a classification hierarchy (classes and sub classes) to structure your assets and, if needed, define the locations where you store assets.

## To set up general behavior for fixed assets functionality

Define the general behavior of the fixed asset functionality and its document number series on the **Fixed Assets Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To set up fixed asset posting groups

Use posting groups to define groups of fixed assets. Entries for these posting groups post to the same general ledger accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Group Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   To make sure that balancing accounts for different fixed assets postings are automatically inserted when you choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on journal lines, follow the next step, based on appreciation posting.
4. On the **Balancing Account** FastTab, in the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field, select the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation.

For more information about using the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on fixed asset G/L journal lines, see [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).

## To set up fixed asset journal templates

A template is a predefined layout for a journal. The template contains information about trace codes, reports, and number series. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset journal template the first time that you open the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, but you can set up other journal templates.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset class and subclass codes

In fixed assets, you can define a classification hierarchy that can be used to group assets. The hierarchy has two levels: classes and subclasses.

### Fixed asset class codes

Fixed asset classes are the top-level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. For example, use classes to divide assets into tangible or intangible assets. You must create at least one fixed asset class in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Classes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset classes that you want to create.

### Fixed asset subclass codes

Fixed asset subclasses are the second level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. Each subclass points to a top-level class. Use fixed asset subclass codes to group fixed assets in more specific categories, such as buildings, vehicles, furniture, or machinery. You must create at least one fixed asset subclass in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Subclasses**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset subclasses that you want to create.

## Start to register assets

If you're using the fixed assets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, you must set up the general ledger application area before you set up fixed assets. How you do so depends on whether you integrate fixed assets with the general ledger.  

The following procedure is used if fixed asset transactions are to be posted to the general ledger.  

1. Complete the basic setups for fixed assets.  
2. Fill in a fixed asset card for each existing asset.  
3. Create a fixed asset depreciation book for each depreciation purpose (such as tax and financial statements). For each depreciation book, define the terms and conditions, such as integration with the general ledger.

    Enable general ledger integration by following the next steps. First, ensure that general ledger integration isn't enabled for all depreciation books, then post the opening entries, and finally, turn on general ledger integration.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **Depreciation Book Card** page.
6. On the **Integration** FastTab, turn off all of the toggles. If you have more than one depreciation book, repeat this step for each one.  
7. In the fixed asset journal, enter the following lines for each asset:
   * A line with the acquisition cost.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation to the end of the previous fiscal year.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation from the start of the current fiscal year to the date that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set to start calculating the depreciation.

    If you have other opening balances you can also enter them now, such as write-down and appreciation.  
8. After you enter and post the journal lines for each asset, turn on general ledger integration in the
depreciation books.

If the fixed assets aren't integrated with the general ledger, skip steps six and eight.

## To set up fixed asset location codes (optional)

Fixed asset location codes define identifiers for where assets can be located, such as sales department, reception, administration, production, or warehouse. You can use them to register the location of a fixed asset. This information is useful for insurance and inventory purposes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset locations that you want to create.

## To set up fixed asset allocation keys (optional)

Use allocation keys to allocate transactions to various departments or projects. For example, you can set up an allocation key to allocate vehicle depreciation costs with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department. For more information, see [Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md).

Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes, not to individual assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **FA Posting Groups** page, choose the **Allocations** action, and then choose a posting type.
3. On the **FA Allocations** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each posting type that you want to define allocation keys for.

## To set up fixed asset journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each journal template. For example, employees can have their own journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal templates (optional)

Use dedicated reclassification journals to transfer, split, or combine fixed assets. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset reclassification journal template the first time you open the **FA Reclass. Journal** page, but you can set up other reclassification journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each reclassification journal template. For example, employees can have their own reclassification journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the reclassification journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Reclass. Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

# Maintain fixed assets

Maintenance costs are operating expenses for the things you do to preserve the condition of your fixed assets. Unlike capital improvements, maintenance doesn't increase the value of your assets.

Each time you send a fixed asset for service, you record information such as the service date, the vendor who did the work, and the service agent's phone number. You enter maintenance information on several pages:

* Fixed Asset Card
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Invoice
* Fixed Asset G/L Journal

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** action to recalculate maintenance costs.

## Record a maintenance cost directly on a fixed asset

Every time you do maintenance for an asset, such as a service visit, you can record it on the **Maintenance Registrations** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to record maintenance for, and then choose the **Maintenance Registration** action.
3. On the **Maintenance Registration** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Post maintenance costs from a fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Book List**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that is assigned to the fixed asset, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, make sure the **Maintenance** checkbox isn't selected so that you don't post maintenance costs to the general ledger.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
6. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Maintenance**.
7. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for maintenance posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Step 7 only works if you set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Maintenance Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Maintenance Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
8. Choose the **Post** action.

## Record maintenance cost from a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to record maintenance costs for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for purchase orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
4. In the **No.** field, choose the asset, and then specify the quantity and cost.
5. In the **FA Posting Type** field, choose **Maintenance**.
6. Post the purchase invoice.

# Customizing Business Central online using apps

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online by installing apps that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. These apps are also called *extensions* because they *extend* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Manage apps

When you first launch [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some apps are already installed for you. Over time, more apps will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the app or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an app that lets you integrate with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. But, an extension that offers integration with another payment service might come along. In that case, you can install the new extension and then choose which to use.  

To use an app, you must have the permissions to the installed objects.

To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant extensions, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the **D365 Extension Mgt.** user group, or you must have the **EXTEN. MGT. - ADMIN** permission set explicitly. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. Learn more in [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you cannot upload per-tenant extensions or install AppSource apps through the **Extension Management** page. You cannot install AppSource apps on-premises, including in Docker-based deployments.

You manage the apps on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link. Learn more in [Install and Uninstall apps](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you should have access to an app but you cannot find its functionality, check the **Extension Management** page - if the app is not listed there, you can install it as described in the following section.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). Learn more in [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).

If you choose an app, you can read about what the app does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to the terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

When you install an app, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** extension. Other apps add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app, your data is preserved. If you install the app again, it's still available. There are some apps that are required, and you can't uninstall them from the **Extension Management** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can keep an eye out for new apps from Microsoft and other suppliers at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central&page=1).

## Understanding the risks of installing apps

[!INCLUDE [ui-extensions-risk-install-apps](includes/ui-extensions-risk-install-apps.md)]

## Apps and data transfer

When apps communicate with other services, they might transfer data out of the geography of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Examples of such apps include banking, payment, payroll, and forecasting services.

The same is true for the base application, such as the following capabilities:

* Cash Flow Forecast
* Document Exchange Service
* Dataverse connections
* OCR Service
* Online Map
* EU VAT Reg. No. Service

## Connect your business

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. These apps can connect your business to external services that increase productivity by automating processes. For example, you can connect to your banks and automatically import bank transactions. The apps are easy to install and set up directly from this page. Choose an app to learn more about capabilities and pricing.  

View the list of suggested apps by choosing the **Connectivity Apps** action in the **Extension Management** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The first person to open the **Connectivity Apps** page must allow the extension to connect to an external service. Allow the connection once or always. If you choose to block the connection, you must find the relevant apps on AppSource. If you allow the connection once or always, be aware that your information might be shared with third parties. Learn more in the section [Understanding the risks of installing apps](#understanding-the-risks-of-installing-apps).

This external service generates a list of relevant apps based on your country or region

## Recommended apps

Microsoft partners and resellers can create an app that they can use to compile lists of apps that they often recommend to their customers. If they do, and they deployed the app to your tenant, the apps are available on the **Recommended Apps** page. There you can read about each app and decide whether to install them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you're interested in providing a list of recommended apps, see [Recommend Apps from AppSource](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/recommend-apps) in the administration content.

# Analyze general ledger (G/L) transactions

When a transaction is posted to the general ledger, the following data is stored in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database: a single row in the G/L register table and one or more rows in the G/L Entry table.

## Analyzing the G/L register

You can use the G/L Registers page for financial reporting and transaction tracking. The page gives you an overview of all transactions to the general ledger with the ability to navigate to related entries in subledgers, such as VAT entries or Customer Ledger Entries. You can also see which type of transaction that occured, the user who did the transaction and when it was recorded in the database.

The G/L Registers page is particularly useful during audits, as it provides auditors with easy access to related detailed transaction information. It helps identify any discrepancies, errors, or unusual entries that may require further investigation. 

## Example: use analysis mode to get an overview of G/L transaction types and volume

[!INCLUDE [gl-register-analysis-example](includes/gl-register-analysis-example.md)]


## Analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries

Depending on your need for details or aggregation when analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries, you have several options:

- use the G/L entries page in analysis mode. To learn more, go to [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md)  
- use the Chart of Accounts page to get a summary across all your G/L accounts. To learn more, go to [Analyze finance data from the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
- run or define a financial report. To learn more, go to [Primary capabilities of financial reporting](finance-financial-reporting-capabilities.md).

# Work with intercompany documents and journals

Use intercompany documents or journals to post transactions with your intercompany partners. You can post transactions to G/L accounts, and if you set up intercompany bank accounts you can also post bank-to-bank transactions. To learn more about setting up intercompany bank accounts, go to [Specify the bank accounts to use for intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#specify-bank-accounts-for-intercompany-partners).  

When you post an intercompany document or journal line in your company, a corresponding document or journal line is created in your intercompany outbox. You transfer the line from your outbox to your partner. Your partner can then post the corresponding transaction in their company, without having to reenter the data.

For sales and purchase documents, the intercompany partner code on the customer or vendor ensures that all orders and invoices for transactions between the partners produce corresponding documents in the partner companies. The company accounts balance correctly.

The same is true for intercompany general journal lines. You don't need to specify accounts, you just choose the partner company. Corresponding intercompany general journal lines are then created in the partner company.

## Fill in and send an intercompany sales order

You can send sales and purchase orders and return orders before posting. Invoices and credit memos can't be sent until they're posted.

The following procedure describes how to create and send an intercompany sales order. The same steps apply to intercompany purchase orders and return orders, and to posted intercompany invoices and credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New** to create a new sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Make sure the customer is an intercompany partner.
5. To send the sales order before you post it, choose the **Send IC Sales Order** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do step 5, the sales order goes to your intercompany outbox, where you can send it later. To learn more about the intercompany inbox and outbox, go to [Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox](intercompany-how-manage-intercompany-inbox.md).

## Fill in and post an intercompany journal

When you post an intercompany general journal line in your company, a corresponding journal line is created in your intercompany outbox that you can transfer to your partner. With 2022 release wave 1, you can also set up the company to automatically create received intercompany transactions that partners posted in intercompany general journals. Your partner can then post the corresponding transaction in their company, without having to reenter the data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/invoicing/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, enter the intercompany general ledger account that the amount posts to in your partner's company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This field must be filled in on a line with a bank account or general ledger account in either the **Account No.** field or the **Bal. Account No.** field.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

The entries are posted in your company and a journal with corresponding entries is created in your intercompany outbox. From there, you can send them to your partner.

# Record sustainability entries

You can manually record greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or water and waste intensity in the sustainability ledger by using sustainability journals. You can also use purchase documents or general journals to record GHG emissions.  

<!--> [!NOTE]
> Posting water and waste intensity and using general journals for posting emissions will be enabled starting *2025 release wave 1*.  -->

## Sustainability journals

Sustainability journals are designed to track and record sustainability-related activities by using the same user experience as other journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually enter emissions and water or waste intensity in a journal. Alternatively, if you don't have the information, you can use built-in formulas to accurately calculate emissions or water or waste intensity based on parameters that correspond to various types of sources and accounts.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in that journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where it can't be changed. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries.

### Use journal templates and batches

By default, there are standard and recurring sustainability journal templates.

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. To do so, select the **Batches** action on the **Sustainability Journal Templates** page, and then create the new **Sustainability Journal Batch** on the new page. For example, you can define your own journal batch for each emission scope by using the **Emission Scope** option and then selecting among the four existing scopes or **Water/Waste** option. For each batch, you can add or change the **Source Code** and **Reason Code** values.

> [!TIP]
> If you have many lines, you can help reduce the risk of mistakes by having one journal batch for each emission type. Alternatively, you can use the common batch for all emission types.

### Validate sustainability journals

On the **Sustainability Setup** page, you can turn on a background check to help prevent posting delays. If any mistakes occur while you work in the sustainability journal, the validation notifies you and prevents you from posting the journal.

When you enable the validation, the **Journal Check** FactBox shows issues on the current line and in the whole batch. Validation occurs when you load a journal batch and when you select another journal line. The **Issues Total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found. You can select the tile to open an overview of the issues.

### Work with sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you plan to post in the same batch.
3. For internal documents, you can leave the **Document Type** field blank. If not, you can select **Invoice**, **Credit Memo**, or **GHG Credit**.  
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use a batch where the emission scope is configured, the **Emission Scope** value in the sustainability account must equal the **Emission Scope** value in the batch.

5. You can either manually fill in the emission amounts or use formulas.

    - If you have accurate information about gas emission or water or waste intensity and want to post it (that is, if you have the information on the received invoice, or some other measured model), select the **Manual Input** field to indicate that you manually enter the amounts. In this case, you can't enter your data directly in the **Fuel/Electricity**, **Distance**, **Custom Amount**, **Installation Multiplier**, and **Time Factor** fields because they become uneditable. However, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields remain editable, and you can enter your data directly in them.
    - If you don't have accurate knowledge of the gas emission or water or waste intensity and must calculate it, don't select the **Manual Input** field. In this case, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields become uneditable. However, you can enter your calculation details based on the formula that you're using. To learn more about the formulas that are defined in the **sustainability account category**, go to [Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger](finance-sustainability-accounts-ledger.md#account-categories).  

6. To post the journal, select the **Post** action. When you post in a sustainability journal, entries are generated in the sustainability ledger.

> [!NOTE]
> For water and waste intensity calculation, you can only use a formula with the **Custom Amount** that's multiplied with the emission factor from the **Sustainability Account Subcategory**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your formula is based on the **Calculate from General Ledger** option in the sustainability account category, you must use the **Collect Amount from G/L Entries** action before you post the journal. The action calculates emissions based on this data source. Additionally, if you made changes to the emission factors after the journal lines were filled in, you must select the **Recalculate** action to get the correct amount in the journal.

### Changing account subcategories in the journal line  

You can have more than one **Account Subcategory** related to one **Sustainability Account**, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting. To use a different subcategory for each account, you can easily change this value on the **Sustainability Journal** line, but you can only select subcategories that are already associated with the specific account and account category.

> [!TIP]
> Here's an example. You want to use one account for different types of cars, but the cars have different emission factors. You can set up one account and create an account subcategory for each emission factor. When you work in your sustainability journal, you can easily change your account subcategory based on the car type you choose to use for recording emissions.

### Recurring journals

A recurring journal is a sustainability journal that has specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. Examples include sustainability transactions such as electricity or heat, or other similar transactions. You can use recurring journals to post fixed and variable amounts.

When you use a recurring journal, you create the entries that you regularly post only one time. Information such as the accounts, dimensions, and dimension values remain in the journal after posting. Each time that you post, you can make any changes that are needed.

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how the amount on the journal line is handled after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time that you post the line, you can select the **F Fixed** option to let the amount remain after posting. If you use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time that you post, you can select the **V Variable** option to delete the amount after posting.

The **Recurring Frequency** field is also important and must be set. It's a date formula field that determines how often the entry on the journal line is posted. Learn more in [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

The **Expiration Date** field determines the date when the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after that date. The advantage of using the **Expiration Date** field is that the line isn't immediately deleted from the journal. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future. If the field is blank, the line is posted every time, until you delete it from the journal.

## Purchase documents  

To enable recording of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in any purchase-related documents, you must select the **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** on the **Sustainability Setup** page. 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   - Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want the invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   - Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want the order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
2. Populate the header and lines based on the instructions in [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. If you have information about emissions on your invoice from the vendor, choose the appropriate **Sustainability Account No.** in the document lines and add emission values using one of the following fields (based on what you want to track and emissions you have on your physical invoice): **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, or **Emission N2O**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values you enter in the emission fields are fixed amounts per line. They aren't multiplied with the **Quantity** field. You can use **Sustainability Account No.** only when the **Type** field (**Option Values**) is **Item** or **G/L Account**. You can't use **Resource** or **Charge (Item)** **Option Values**. 

4. If you want to review total emissions before posting, you can open the statistics page and find the total posted emissions and emissions for posting per document (any purchase-related documents) on the **Sustainability** FastTab.
5. Post the documents and open a new **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
6. Select the **Find Entries** action. You have a **Sustainability Ledger Entry** as one of the related entries on the **Find entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post the document, for each of the purchase lines where you have **Sustainability Account No.**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an independent **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **Invoice** as a **Document Type** and the same **Document No.**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create and post a **Purchase Credit Memo** manually, or by using the **Cancel**, **Correct**, or **Create Corrective Credit Memo** actions, in which case [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the existing values from the posted invoice.  

## General journals

You can use general journals to post gas emissions together with the financial amounts. This option is used if you want to post your incoming invoices using journals and not documents. In this situation, you can [use general journals](ui-work-general-journals.md) as usual, but before posting journals, you should add emissions. There isn't an option to use formulas in general journals. After you select the right **Sustainability Account No.** for the journal line, you can add only total emission amounts in the **Total Emission CO2**, **Total Emission CH4**, or **Total Emission N2O** fields. After you post, lines are recorded in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** and if you included a carbon equivalent calculation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select the **Sustainability Account No.** in the journal line only if **Document Type** for this line is **Invoice** or **Credit Memo**. For all other options, you can't select the **Sustainability Account No.** and post emissions.

# Enter external document numbers

You can enter external document numbers for customers and vendors in all sales and purchase orders, invoices, and credit memos. You can use these numbers to search for posted sales and purchase lines later.  

> [!NOTE]
> Specify the document number that your customer or vendor has specified. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not check if these external document numbers are unique or duplicates.

The following procedure explains how to specify an external document number on a sales order, but similar steps apply to other sales and purchase documents.

## To enter external document numbers in a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant sales order, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the invoice number.  

    On purchase documents, the relevant field is the **Vendor Invoice No.** field.
4. Fill in any other required fields.

# Delivering Service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you deliver service according to the contracts that you have created and the service orders that you have committed to fulfilling. Your service technicians or dispatcher will find outstanding service orders easy to locate when they use the **Dispatch Board**. At a glance, the **Dispatch Board** shows which orders are in progress and which orders are complete.  
  
Another way to review pending service orders is to use the **Service Tasks** page. In this view of your service obligations, you can see where in your service workflow an order is and change that status to reflect interactions with your customer.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.   

A service management application must interface with a customer request for service. That service request usually is translated into a service order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides tools to create an order both directly in response to a customer request or as part of the contract process, if that is how your application is set up.  
  
If needed, you can manage a loaner program for your customers. You can also determine your pricing structure, put service pricing offerings into logical groupings, and create price adjustments.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Use Automated Data Capture Systems (ADCS) foundation

> [!Important]
> The Automated Data Capture System (ADCS) solution provides a way for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to communicate with handheld devices through web services. You must work with a Microsoft partner who can provide the link between the web service and the specific handheld device. 

You can use your automatic data capture system (ADCS) to register the movement of items in the warehouse and to register some journal activities, such as quantity adjustments in the warehouse item journal and physical inventories. ADCS typically involves scanning a barcode.

To use ADCS, you must give each item stored in the warehouse an item identifier. You must also set up miniforms, handheld functions, data exchanges, and specify settings for fields that control ADCS. You specify whether to use ADCS on the location card of a warehouse.

Based on the needs of your warehouse, you define the amount of information displayed in the miniform setup for the particular handheld device. The following are examples of information that you can display:  

- Data from tables within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a list of pick documents from which the user can select.  
- Text information.  
- Messages to show confirmations or errors about activities performed and registered by the handheld device user.

## To enable Web Services for ADCS

To use Automated Data Capture System, you must enable the ADCS web service. You must work with a Microsoft partner who can implement a web service that can connect ADCS and a specific handheld device. You can learn more about the web service for ADCS by examining codeunit 7714. 
 
## To set up a warehouse to use ADCS  

To use ADCS, you must specify which warehouse locations use the technology.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't set up a warehouse to use ADCS if it also has a bin capacity policy.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the warehouse for which you want to enable ADCS, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, turn on the **Use ADCS** toggle.  

## To specify an item to use ADCS  

Each warehouse item that you want to use with ADCS must be assigned an identifier code to link it with its item number. For example, you can use the item's bar code as the identifier code. An item can also have multiple identifier codes. You may find this useful in the case where an item is available in various units of measures, such as pieces and pallets. In this case, assign an identifier code to each.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item from the list that is part of your ADCS solution, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Identifiers** action.
4. On the **Item Identifiers** page, choose the **New** action.
5. In the **Code** field, specify the identifier for the item. For example, the identifier could be the item's bar code number.  

    You can also enter a **Variant Code** and a **Unit of Measure** code.  

6. If needed, enter multiple codes for each item.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. To review the information, choose the **Identifier Code** field to open the **Item Identifiers** page.

## To add an ADCS user  

You can add any user to an ADCS. When you do, the user must provide a password. Optionally, you can also provide a connection that identifies the ADCS user as a warehouse employee. The ADCS user password can be different from their sign-in password. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **ADCS Users**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the user. The name can't have more than 20 characters, including spaces.  
4. In the **Password** field, enter a password.  

### To specify that a warehouse employee is an ADCS user  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. If needed, add a new warehouse employee. Learn more at [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).  
3. Choose the **Edit List** action.  
4. Select a warehouse employee from the list. In the **ADCS User** field, choose the name of an ADCS user from the list.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default warehouse for the employee must be one that uses ADCS.

## To create and customize miniforms

You use miniforms to describe the information that you want to present on a handheld device. For example, you can create miniforms to support the warehouse activity of picking items. After you create a miniform, you can add functions to it for the common actions that a user takes with handheld devices, such as moving up or down a line.  

> [!NOTE]
> To implement or change the functionality of a miniform function, you must create a new codeunit for the **Handling Codeunit** field to perform the required action or response. You can learn more about ADCS functionality by examining the following codeunits:
>
> * 7705
> * 7706
> * 7712
> * 7713  

### To create a miniform for ADCS  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Miniforms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a code for the miniform. Optionally, enter values in all other fields.  

    Turn on the **Start Miniform** toggle to indicate that the miniform is the first form that's available when a user signs in.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, define the fields that appear on the miniform. The order in which you enter lines is the order in which the lines appear on the handheld device.  

When you have created a miniform, the next steps are to create functions and to associate functionality for various keyboard inputs.  

### To customize miniform functions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Miniforms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a miniform from the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Functions** action.  
4. In the **Function Code** drop-down list, select a code to represent the function that you want to associate with the miniform. For example, you can select **ESC** to associate functionality with the **ESC** key.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

Business apps often use data from more than one source. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] combines data into a single set of logic that makes it easier to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to other Dynamics 365 applications. For example, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] or your own application built on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

The following steps provide an overview of the steps to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Note]  
> These tasks require the **System Administrator** security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Assign licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who will use the integrated apps.

2. Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Connect to Dataverse](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md).  

3. Synchronize data between the apps. For more information, see [Synchronizing Business Central and Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md). 

## Get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

To get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you'll need a Microsoft Power Apps account. If you don't already have a Power Apps account, you can get one for free by visiting [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and choosing the **Get started free** link. To learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to the [Get started with Dataverse](/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps-common-data-service/) module from Microsoft training.

## Bi-directional or uni-directional data synchronization

You can synchronize data either to or from one Dynamics 365 business app to another, or in both directions in near-real time, through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, if you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], a salesperson can create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and the order synchronizes to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Conversely, from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the salesperson can check the availability of the item on the order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## Standard and custom entities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] securely stores data in a set of tables, which are sets of records similar to how a table stores data within a database. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, but you can also create custom tables specific to your organization. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view standard and custom tables being synchronized on the Integration Table Mappings page.

## About the Business Central Base Integration Solution

The Base Integration Solution is a key component of the integration. The solution adds the required roles and access levels to the user accounts for the integration, and it creates tables needed to map [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

By default, the **Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] connection** assisted setup guide imports the solution. To do that, the setup guide uses an administrator user account that you specify. This account must be a valid user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the **System Administrator** security role.  

To learn more about user accounts, go to the following articles:

* [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md) 
* [Create users in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) and assign security roles](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles). 

The administrator account is used only one time during the setup for the configuration changes that the Base Integration Solution makes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. After the solution imports, the account is no longer needed. Integration will continue to use the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

In addition to customizing [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the solution also creates a security role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this role is assigned only to the user account that's automatically created for synchronization. To learn more about this role, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

When you set up the connection, you create the integration table mappings that you need to synchronize data. Entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are mapped to tables and table fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through integration tables. To learn more about mappings, go to [Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

## Handle differences in local and base transaction currencies

You can connect to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a different base currency than the local currency in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You make the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page or by using the **Set up connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide.

To be able to connect, ensure that the base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency that set on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and at least one exchange rate is specified for the currency on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Here's an example. You're connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with Euro (EUR) set as the local currency on the **General Ledger Setup** page to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base transaction currency set to US dollar (USD). You'll need to have USD on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the appropriate exchange rate. 

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the other (non-base) currencies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## What happens when you copy a company

You can safely copy companies that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Copying companies helps reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and can save you valuable time. To learn more about copying companies, go to [Copy a company](about-new-company.md#copy-a-company).

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Managing Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides an overview of what you can do as an administrator to control Microsoft Teams integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## In Microsoft Teams

### Minimum requirements

This section describes the minimum requirements for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app features to work in Teams.

- Required licenses

    The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app requires a Teams license through a Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise plan, Microsoft Teams EEA, or a similar plan that includes Microsoft Teams. Standalone Teams plans like Microsoft Teams (free) or Microsoft Teams Essentials aren't supported.

    Most features of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams also require a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license, as shown in the following table.

    |What|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license|
    |----|---|
    |Search for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record into a conversation, and send it as a card.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Share a link from a page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Teams conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |View a card of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.||
    |View more details of card for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Open a page link in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|

- Allow URL previews

    **Allow URL previews** policy setting must be turned on. Otherwise, a card can't be generated for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links pasted into a Teams conversation. Learn more about this setting in [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

### Managing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app (optional)

As a Teams administrator, you can manage all apps for your organization, including the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. You can approve or install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for your organization, block user's from installing the app, and more.

Learn more in the Microsoft Teams documentation at:

- [Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps)
- [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies)

## In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

### Minimum requirements

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version:

  Teams integration is only supported for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, not on-premises.

- Codeunit **2718 Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service:

  This codeunit is published as a web service by default. The codeunit is part of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] system application. It's used to get the field data for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page added to a Teams conversation. Learn more about publishing web services in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

- <a name="permissions"></a>User permissions:

  For the most part, the contact search, pages, and data that users can view and edit in a Teams conversation is controlled by their permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

  - To search for contacts, users must have at least read permission to the **Contacts** table. 
  - To paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link into a Teams conversation and have it expand into a card, users must have at least read permission on the page and its data.
  - Once a card is submitted into a conversation, any user in that conversation can view that card without permission to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  - To view more details for a card or open the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must have read permission on the page and its data.
  - To change data, user's need modify permissions.

  Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment

The Microsoft Teams admin center is where you configure Teams app setup policies for the organization. In the Teams admin center, you can use the Centralized Deployment feature to automatically install the Business Central app in Teams for all users in your organization, specific groups, or individual users.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up Centralized Deployment, your Teams account must have at least the [Teams Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#teams-administrator) role.

1. In Business Central, choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Teams App Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link. Or select [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1833) to open the page directly.
2. Read the information on the **Set up the Business Central app for Teams**, then choose **Next** when ready.
3. Open the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163970), and complete the following steps.
    1. Go to **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.
    2. Create a new policy or select the policy that you want to use to install the Business Central app, then select **Add apps**.
    3. In the **Add installed apps** page, search for and select **Business Central**.
    4. Choose **Add**.

       Business Central should now appear under **Installed apps** for the policy.
    5. Configure more settings as needed, then choose **Save**.

    Learn more in [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies) in the Teams documentation.
4. Go back to **Teams App Centralized Deployment** in Business Central and select **Done**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the app setup policy to be applied and the app deployed to users.

## Managing privacy and compliance

Microsoft Teams provides extensive controls for compliance and management of sensitive or personally identifiable data&mdash;including data added to chats and channels by the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

### Understanding where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] cards are stored

After a card is sent to a chat, the card and the fields shown on the card are copied to Teams. This information is subject to the Teams policies for your organization, such as data retention policies. When displaying card details, none of the data in the details window is stored in Teams. The data remains stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and will only be retrieved by Teams when the user chooses to view the details. 

- Learn more about where Teams stores that data at [Location of data in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams).
- Learn more about retention policies in Teams at [Retention policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/retention-policies).

### Restricting sharing of cards 

You prevent specific users or groups from sending cards to chats or channels by setting up messaging policies that turn off the **URL Previews** setting. For more information about this setting, see [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams). 

You can also use information barriers to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other. To learn more, see [Information barriers in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/information-barriers-in-teams).

Data loss prevention features in the Microsoft Purview can't be applied specifically to cards. But they can be applied to the chat messages that contain the cards.

### Responding to data requests

You allow team members and team owners to delete messages that contain sensitive cards by setting up messaging policies, like: **Owners can delete sent messages** and **Users can delete sent messages**. Learn more at [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

Content search and eDiscovery compliance features in the Microsoft Purview can also be applied to cards.

Because card data in Teams is a copy of data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can also use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features to export a customer’s data if requested. Learn more  about privacy in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Privacy FAQ for Business Central Customers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/privacyfaq).

## Show or hide record data on cards

When a record is shared with others in a Teams chat or channel, a card with fields that contain data about the record is shown. All recipients can view this data (or record summary) by default, regardless of their license or permissions in Business Central. If you're an admin, you can use the **Card Settings** assisted setup guide to hide the record summary from appearing on cards in Teams. Hiding the record summary removes all fields and images but continues to show the **Details** button and other non-record information on the card.

|Record summary on|Record summary off|
|-|-|
|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned on.](media/card-settings-example-on.png)|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned off.](media/card-settings-example-off.png)|

You configure the setting per environment. So when you turn the record summary on or off, it affects all companies in the environment.

1. In Business Central, open the environment that you want to change.

   > [!TIP]
   > To switch the environment, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.
2. Choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Card Settings**, and then choose the related link.
3. Read the information on the **Card Settings**, then choose **Next** when ready.
4. On the **Data Visibility** page, turn on the **Show record summary** switch to display data on the cards or off to hide the data.
5. Select **Next** and follow the instructions to complete the setup guide.

# Inventory by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory by Location** outlines inventory levels across an organization's locations. It provides an accurate picture of each location and the inventory levels broken down by category and item.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is designed for management teams in warehousing and supply chain management.

Warehouse managers can use the report to check whether each location has appropriate stock levels. This information can help identify whether a location is low or high on stock, and show where you can move stock around where required.

For supply chain managers, the report provides information about where you store each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions about shipping and ensure that items are delivered on time and at the lowest cost.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Location* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries
- Location

## Try the report

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

The topic contains the following procedures:  

* To set up the company for electronic document sending and receiving  
* To set up VAT posting for electronic document sending and receiving  
* To set up countries/regions for electronic document sending and receiving  
* To set up items for electronic document sending and receiving  
* To set up units of measure for electronic document sending and receiving  
* To set up customers for electronic document sending  
* To select the **PEPPOL** electronic document format for electronic document sending  
* To set up vendors for electronic document receiving  
* To select the **PEPPOL – Invoice** data exchange definition for electronic document receiving  
* To set up the G/L account to use on new purchase invoice lines for non\-identifiable items and non\-items

# Automate reminders in collections

Make your collections more effective by automating the process of creating, issuing, and sending reminders to your customers. Automation can significantly reduce the time you spend on collections, provide a better overview of the process, and give you full control over each step.

On the **Reminder Automation** page, you define the individual actions (steps). You can combine the steps to create, issue, and send reminders, or you can create a separate automation for each step if that's better for your collection processes. Automations are based on reminder terms and reminder levels. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md). You can set filters for reminder terms for an automation as a whole, and set filters for each action in the automation. You can also attach outstanding invoices to emails as PDF files.

Automation happens through a job queue entry. When you set up an automation, use the **Cadence** field to specify how and when it runs. If you choose **Manual**, the automation runs one time when you use the **Start** action. You can also choose **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or choose **Custom** to set up a more detailed cadence. If you choose **Custom**, you must enter a date formula. To learn more about entering a date formula, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas). When you choose an option other than **Manual**, the automation runs until you pause it to put it on hold. If you want to be even more specific about when it runs, use the **Job queue entries** action to open the **Job Queue Entries** page and adjust the recurrence, for example to daily or a specific weekday.

## Automate the reminders flow

The following sections describe how to set up reminders to create, issue, and send automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminders Automation**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. In the **Reminder Terms Filter** field, choose the reminder term or terms to use this automation for.
1. In the **Cadence** field, choose how often the automation runs.
1. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **New**, and then choose whether the automation creates, issues, or sends reminders. Choose **OK**.
1. Depending on the type of action the automation performs, fill in the fields as necessary on the setup page. To learn more about the settings, go to [Settings for reminder actions](#settings-for-reminder-actions).
1. After you set up the actions for the automation, you can use the **Move up** and **Move down** actions to adjust the order in which they run.

## Settings for reminder actions

The setup settings differ for the Create, Issue, and Send reminder actions. The following sections describe how to use them.

### Create

* Set the highest level on all reminder lines.  
* Create reminders for entries that are on hold. For example, this setting is useful if you're in an ongoing dispute with a customer and want them to see the big picture.
* Create reminders for all unpaid invoices, and not just invoices that are overdue. The report displays overdue invoices and invoices that are unpaid but not overdue in separate sections.
* Set filters to make the reminder more specific.

### Issue

When you issue a reminder, you create entries in the customer ledger that contain the posting date and tax date. Use the settings on the **Issue Reminders Setup** page to specify whether to replace that information on the issued reminder with the information from the created reminder. For example, if you created the reminder yesterday, and issue it today, the due date moves one day.

### Send

> [!NOTE]
> The Send automation requires that you've set up email in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about setting up email, go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

The content of the emails, such as attachment texts, email body texts, and language come from the setup for the reminder term. To learn more about email settings, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

Use the settings on the **Send Reminders Setup** page control the following:

* General settings, such as the description, and how many times you send the same reminder.
* Settings for what to include in the reminder.
* Settings for tracking the reminders you send by creating interactions, whether you print or send the reminder by email, and whether you want to attach overdue invoices only, all invoices, or no invoices. 

## Access the history of a reminder

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] keeps track of each time an automation runs. You can access the history by choosing the **Log entries** action. You can also use the **Issued Reminders** action to access a list of the reminders you've issued.

## Handle errors

On the **Actions** FastTab, for each action you can specify whether you want the automation to stop if the action has an error. If you do, the automation won't process the actions that come afterward. To turn this feature on or off, use the **Set stop on error** or **Clear stop on error** actions.

## Change action settings for an automation

You can change settings for an automation at any time. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **Setup**, and then make your changes.

# Create analysis reports

Sales managers need to analyze turnover, gross profit, and other key sales performance indicators regularly. Purchasers are more interested in the dynamics of purchase volumes, vendor performance, and purchase prices. Whereas logistics/inventory managers need information on inventory turnover, analysis of inventory movement, and statistics on inventory value. So there's no one-size-fits-all analysis report.

You can customize analysis reports based on records of your posted transactions, for example, sales, purchases, transfers, and inventory adjustments. In a customizable report, the source data, which is derived from the item ledger (with associated value entries), can be combined, compared, and presented in meaningful user-defined ways. In this sense, the analysis report is similar to a PivotTable report in Microsoft Excel.  

So, for example, you can create a personalized report that focuses on your key accounts in terms of total product turnover in amounts and quantities sold, gross profit, and gross profit percentage during the current month. Then you can have it compare those figures with the results from previous months or the same month last year, and calculate deviations. All this can be done in one and the same view, enabling you to navigate to the cause of identified problem areas and even choose the drop-down to zero in on details all the way down to the level of individual transactions.  

The analysis report consists of the objects you want to analyze (such as customers, customer groups, sales people, and so on, represented as lines) and the analysis parameters, which is the way you want to analyze the object (such as profit calculations, periodic comparisons of sales amounts and volumes or periodic comparisons of actual and budgeted figures, represented as columns). 

In addition to analysis reports, you can create and view similar information in analysis views (based on dimensions). Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Example

You can set up these lines (objects you want to analyze):  

- Computers  
- Displays  
- Spare Parts  

Then you can set up these columns (how you want the objects analyzed):  

- Sales Current Month  
- Sales Last Month  
- Sales in Pct. of last Month  

## Setting up line and column layouts

On the **Analysis Report** page, you can view different line and column layouts that you set up on the:

* **Analysis Line Templates** page where you define the name of the report and the objects you want to show in the lines of your report, and the
* **Analysis Column Templates** page where you define the name of the column template and the analysis parameters that show in the report as columns. Each line on this page represents a column in your report. 

Note that analysis lines and analysis columns are independent from each other.  

Based on the lines and columns you set up, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aggregates the result of your report in the **Analysis Report** page, as shown in the following table.  

|- |Sales Current Month|Sales Last Month|Sales Last Month %|  
|-|-|-|-|  
|Computers| | | |  
|Displays| | | |  
|Spare parts| | | |  
|Total| | | |  

You can, for example, set up one group of lines and several groups of column layouts to show monthly and annual reports, respectively.

## Set up analysis column templates

The following procedure is based on sales analysis views. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis views.

An analysis column template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis column you want in the analysis report. To define a column, you must assign an analysis type code to a line. This analysis type code determines the type of source data in the item ledger entries that the analysis will be based on. Source data can include cost, sales amount, or quantity, and their associated value entries. You can set up as many column templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Column Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Columns** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Columns** page, fill the fields in to specify the columns you want in your analysis report.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To define a column, you must fill in the **Analysis Type Codes** field for all column types except **Formula**. Set up the analysis type codes on the **Analysis Types** page.  
    >
    > Also, in the **Ledger Entry Type** field, if you select **Item Entries**, the actual figures from the item ledger entry are copied. If you select **Item Budget Entries**, the budgeted figures from the budget are copied.  
5. Choose **OK** to save your changes.  

## Set up analysis line templates

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

An analysis line template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis line you want in the analysis report. A line can specify one or a range of items, customers, vendors, or groups. You can also create a formula in a line to sum up the other lines. You can set up as many line templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Line Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Lines** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Lines** page, create lines for the items, customers, vendors, or salespeople you want to view figures for in your analysis report. You must fill in the **Type**, **Range**, and the **Description** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, to create many individual lines for each item, customer, and so on, you can select the appropriate insert option to fill in all the relevant fields on the line. If you need to, you can then edit the lines manually. To insert lines, choose the **Insert Items** or **Insert Item Groups** action.  

## Create a new sales analysis report

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

With analysis reports you can analyze the dynamics of your sales according to key sales performance indicators, such as sales turnover in both amounts and quantities, contribution margin, or progress of actual sales against the budget. You can also use analysis reports to analyze your average sales prices and evaluate the sales performance of your sales force.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Analysis Reports**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis Report Sale** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Edit Analysis Report** action.
5. On the **Sales Analysis Report** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action  

> [!NOTE]  
> Building combinations of line and column templates to create reports and assigning them unique names is optional. If you do this, you won't need to select line and column templates on the **Sales Analysis Report** page. After you have chosen a report name, you can change line and column templates independently and then later select the report name again to restore the original combination.

# Finding Related Entries for Documents

Learn how to find documents and entries that are related to each other based on a piece of common information, like:

- Document number or posting date.
- Business contact type, number, or external document number.
- Item serial number or lot number.

This feature is useful for finding the ledger entries that resulted from certain transactions. When you search by document number, you can print the summary from the **Document Entries** report.

## Get started

The find entries feature is readily available from almost any page by pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> keys. From pages that specifically display posted documents or posted document entries&mdash;for both lists and cards&mdash;you can also open the feature by choosing the **Find entries** action.

The **Find Entries** page includes all related documents and entries based on the document no. and posting date. The page is divided into three sections:

- The top section displays fields and actions that you use for filtering your search.
- The middle section displays related documents based on the search.
- The bottom section displays information about the source document that was found by searching.

## Search for entries

You can search for entries based on information about either the document, business contact, or item reference. On the top section, select one of the following options based on the type of information you have:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
| **Search for documents** | View entries based on a specific document number or posting date. |
| **Search for business contacts** | View entries based on a specific contact type, contact number, and/or external document number. This last option allows you to search for vendor or customer documents by using the number assigned by the contact. |
| **Search for item references** | View entries based on a serial number or lot number. You can enter the lot number or serial number, or filter on the lot number or serial number that you want to search for. This action is useful to see where a specific item tracking number was used, what vendor it came from, or what customer it was sold to. |

After you make a selection, enter the relevant search information in the fields at the top of the page. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] When you're finished, choose **Find** to start the search. If you change any of the filters, you have to choose **Find** again.

> [!TIP]
> For a couple of examples about using **Find Entries**, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md) and [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).

# Get the Business Central add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select the **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [View and Edit in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, it affects Excel files that users created before the transition. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central.

This situation happens because each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action isn't available to users. Learn more in [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- Learn more about preventing users from downloading from the Office store at [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization. Learn more at [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
- Learn more about transitioning from individual acquisition at [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch).

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

In this task, you work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before the add-in deploys automatically in Excel for users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in is either installed automatically for you or you're prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Add-ins** > **More Add-ins**.
1. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see it there, select it, and then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, and then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office add-In* and follow the instructions to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it to the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/240`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel add-in

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, go to [Preparing your network for the Excel add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start. <br><br>For example, the user gets the message "Add-in Warning: This add-in is no longer available" when trying to use the add-in. This particular problem can happen if Centralized Deployment is configured correctly, but the user wasn't assigned access.|Check whether the add-in is deployed centrally. Or, check whether the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users can't acquire add-ins. In that case, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data doesn't load into Excel.|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Or, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in can't connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong.  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This condition doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** checkboxes for the published page. Selecting these checkboxes excludes noneditable FlowFields and fields from the eTag calculation. |These checkboxes are hidden by default. To show them on the **Web Services** page, use [personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user). |
|Users can no longer sign in to the add-in. When they try to sign in, the process stops without completing.| This problem might happen because of an update that we made to the add-in, sometime in July 2022. For more information and a fix, see [Modify the Excel Add-in Configuration to Support July 2022 Update](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/update-excel-addin-configuration).|Applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only.|
| The add-in communicates using the API v2.0 for Dynamics 365 Business Central, and any limitations of this API are automatically inherited. An example limitation is if you try to edit a list and the underlying card uses a confirmation dialog in its AL logic, for example, as its validation logic. | Sometimes there's nothing to do because it's a design choice that the user must explicitly confirm the change. If the confirmation is negligible when using **Edit in Excel**, then you can wrap the confirmation dialog call in an if-conditional statement that checks whether the client type is different from ODataV4, for example, `if SESSION.CurrentClientType() <> ClientType::ODataV4 then`. | There might be other clients that you want to remove the confirmation dialog from, such as OData and SOAP. |

## Known limitations in business logic

|Page  |Limitation| Comments  |
|-------|---------|---------|
|Sales Orders|Error message: 'Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services attempted to issue a client callback to run page 301 Ship-to Address List as modal.' Client callbacks aren't supported on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services. | The **Ship-to Code** on the **Sales Order** page is editable only with specific Ship-to options. Setting **Alternate Shipping Address** to **Ship-to** opens the **Ship-to Address List** modal dialog, which isn't compatible with Edit in Excel.|  
|Project Journal|Update of the **Unit Price** field doesn't trigger an update of the **Line Amount**. Instead, it updates **Line Discount**.| Using the web client, you can update fields in any order—price, amount, line discount. Other fields are updated automatically. To avoid cascade updates, the fields have advanced logic that relies on xRec, which behaves differently when called via APIs.|

## Known limitations in metadata generation

When using **Edit in Excel** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], either by selecting the **Edit in Excel** action on a page or when the Excel add-in loads after opening an Excel workbook, you might encounter the following error: _Metadata was unable to be retrieved for entity \<entity name\> as it was not found_.

This error occurs when the page you're attempting to modify becomes too complex for **Edit in Excel** to process effectively. The primary cause is the installation of multiple extensions that add fields with identical field names to the same parent page, leading to conflicts. It's also possible for a single extension to block the metadata generation.

### Single extension blocking metadata creation

Consider the following scenario involving extension _A_, which includes the page extension _CustomerCardExtA_ and the page _WebViewerA_ where _PageType = CardPart_.

When metadata is generated for the _Customer Card_ page, the algorithm evaluates each individual field, including those fields added by extensions. However, if extension _A_ is installed, this process fails because _WebViewerA_ doesn't share the same source table as the _Customer Card_ page.

To resolve this issue, you should add a _Customer_ `SourceTable` property to the _WebViewerA_ page. An example of this modification can be observed in the code snippets containing _CustomerCardExtB_ and _WebViewerB_.

In some cases, you might need to embed the `CardPart` on multiple pages without referencing a specific source table. For such scenarios, we recommend creating a separate `CardPart` for each page where you also need to generate metadata and refactoring the shared logic into a codeunit.

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerA"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerB"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple extensions causing collisions

To resolve this issue, there are two potential solutions:

1. **Disable extensions**: To identify which extension is causing the conflict, you can disable extensions that affect the page one at a time. However, this approach might not be ideal if the extensions in question are necessary for your business processes.

2. **Modify extension code**: This solution involves analyzing the root cause of the issue and addressing it by modifying the code of the conflicting extensions.

To better understand this issue, consider the following example involving the **Customer Card** page (ID 21). When you are on the **Customer List** page (ID 22) and select **Edit in Excel**, a web service is generated in the background that exposes the fields from the **Customer Card** page. This web service includes all page fields defined on the **Customer Card** page, while table fields are only exposed if they correspond to a page field or are part of the primary key.

When an extension is installed that extends the **Customer Card** page, the fields added by the extension are also exposed in the web service. While extensions can't create page fields with the same names as those fields already existing on the **Customer Card** page, conflicts can still arise when multiple extensions add fields with identical names.

For example, suppose the following extension, referred to as _A_, is installed:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension A
pageextension 50101 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSize)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50101 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; ShoeSize; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Now, consider that another extension, referred to as _B_, is installed, which also modifies the **Customer Card** page:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension B
pageextension 50102 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSizeField)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50102 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50105; ShoeSizeField; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both extensions A and B add a page field named `ShoeSize` to the **Customer Card** page. This condition results in a conflict, which leads to a metadata generation failure for the **Customer Card** page.

To resolve this issue, you need access to the code of at least one of the extensions, and then to modify the conflicting page field names to avoid collisions.

## Deploy the Excel add-in for Business Central online

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the administrator can deploy the add-in for all users. But users can also install the add-in themselves, provided they have permission to configure their Office experience.  

> [!TIP]
> In some organizations, administrators cannot deploy add-ins centrally. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To deploy the Excel add-in for all users

1. As the administrator, sign in to the Microsoft commercial website and find the add-in at [https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629).
2. Choose the **Get it now** button.

    You'll be redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
3. In the left panel, go to **Settings**, and then choose **Add-ins**.
4. In the **Configure add-in** pane, specify which users to grant access to the add-in.
5. Save your changes.


### To add the Excel add-in locally

1. Open Excel, and then open any Excel workbook.
2. On the **Insert** menu, choose **Office Add-ins**, and then choose **Admin managed** or **Store** as appropriate.
3. Search for *Dynamics Office Add-In*, and then install the add-in.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, you must configure the connection.

> [!TIP]
> If the workbook is not automatically saved to the user's OneDrive, then recommend them to save all workbooks that they export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].When they open the workbook again, the connection is still available, so they do not have to configure the connection again.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain deployments, the administrator must configure network access to unblock the Excel add-in. For more information, see [Preparing Your Network for the Excel Add-In](configuring-network-for-addins.md).-->

# Flush components according to operation output

You can define different flushing strategies to automate the registration of consumption of components.

This feature is useful for the following reasons:  

- **Inventory Valuation**

    Value entries for output and consumption are created in parallel as the production order progresses. Without routing link codes, the inventory value increases as output is posted and decreases later when you post the consumption with the finished production order.  
- **Inventory Availability**

    With gradual consumption posting, the availability of component items is more up-to-date, which is important to maintain the internal balance between demand and supply. Without routing link codes, other demands for the component might believe that it's available as long as it's pending a delayed consumption posting.  
- **Just-in-Time**

    With the ability to customize products to customer requests, you can minimize waste by making sure that work and system changes only occur when it's necessary.  

- **Reduce data entry**

    The ability to automatically flush an operation lets you automate the entire process of recording consumption and output. The disadvantage of using automatic flushing is that you might not accurately record, or even be aware of, scrap.

## Automatic consumption posting (flushing) methods  

- Forward Flush the Entire Order  
- Forward Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing the Entire Order  

### Forward flush an entire order  

Forward flushing a production order at the start of the job is similar to a manual consumption. The significant difference is that consumption happens automatically.  

- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed.  
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM, multiplied by the number of parent items you're building.  
- There's no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed.  
- When you consume items from inventory, it doesn't matter when output journal entries are made because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting.  
- No routing link codes can be set.  

Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with:  

- A low number of defects.  
- A low number of operations.  
- High component consumption in early operations.  

### Forward flushing by operation  

Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item. Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes, which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM.  

The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started. Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation. And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered.  

The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items you're building (expected quantity).  

This technique is best employed when there are many operations and certain components aren't needed until late in the assembly sequence. In fact, a Just-in-Time (JIT) setup might not even have the items on hand when the RPO is begun.  

Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes. Some components might not be used until final assembly operations and shouldn't be withdrawn from stock until that time.  

### Back flushing by operation  

Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal.  

The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known.  

Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes. The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity.  

The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items posted as output for the operation. This quantity might be different than the expected quantity.  

### Back flushing an entire order  

This reporting method doesn't consider routing link codes.  

No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to *Finished*. The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that you finished and put in inventory.  

Backward flushing the entire production order requires the same setup as for forward flushing: The reporting method must be set to backward on each item card for all items within the parent BOM to be reported. In addition, all routing link codes must be removed from the production BOM. 

For example, if a production order to produce 800 meters requires 8 kg of a component, then when you post 200 meters as output, 2 kg are automatically posted as consumption.

You can achieve that by combining backward flushing method and routing link codes so that the quantity that is flushed for each operation is proportional to the actual output of the finished operation. For items that are set up with backward flushing method, the default behavior is to calculate and post component consumption when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. If you also define routing link codes, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished, and the quantity that was consumed in the operation is posted. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## To flush components according to operation output

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Flushing Method** field, select **Backward**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Select **Pick + Backward** if the component is used in a location that is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Define routing link codes for every operation that consumes the component. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Don't use the same routing link for different operations in the routing. Using the same routing link would lead to registration of consumption of component for each linked operation.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Define routing link codes from each instance of the component to the operation that consumes it.

The consumption is posted automatically when you register output. To learn more, go to [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).

## Flushing methods

The following table describes the flushing method options that you can specify on **Item** cards and **Stockkeeping Unit** cards.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-------------|  
|Manual|You can manually consume items without picking. For each item, stockkeeping unit, or production order component line you can ignore the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** setting in the **Location Card** page. Skipping warehouse or inventory picks is typical for automatic flushing methods, such as **Backward** and **Forward**. It might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, they might require manual posting of consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can very or they require item tracking.<br><br>To start using this feature, on the **Feature Management** page, activate **Feature Update: 'Manual' flushing method without requiring pick**. Existing records upgrade from **Manual** to the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. The **Pick + Manual** option is added immediately and works, regardless of whether you enable the feature key. If the feature isn't enabled, **Manual** and **Pick + Manual** both require picking due to the original behavior. When the feature key is enabled, the **Manual** option doesn't require picking.|
|Forward|Automatically posts consumption according to the production order component lines. <br><br>By default, the posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a production order to **Released**. However, if you use the **Routing Link** Code field on production order component lines, then posting occurs per operation when the operation starts. For more information, see [How to: Create Routing Links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links). <br><br> **Note**<br>For the forward flushing option, the operation-specific posting that you get with routing link codes is based on the expected quantity that is defined on the component line. For information about operation-specific flushing based on actual output, see the description of **Backward** in this article.<br><br>If the location or resources where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md). <br><br> **Important** <br>Forward flushing also occurs when you choose **Refresh** on a released production order that was created from scratch. On the released production orders, you can't change bin information because you generate the production order component lines when you refresh the order. Refreshing the order forward flushes the components. Therefore, if you want to change bin information on production order component lines before forward flushing occurs, then that order must be created with the *Planned* or *Firm Planned* status.|
|Backward|Automatically calculates and posts consumption according to the production order component lines.<br><br> By default, the calculation and posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. However, if you use the **Routing Link Code** field on the production order component lines, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished.<br><br> **Note** <br>Backward flushing and routing link codes can be combined so that the quantity that is flushed per operation is proportional to the actual output of that operation. For more information, see [How to: Flush Components According to Operation Output](#to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output).<br><br> If the location or machine center where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**.|
|Pick + Forward|Same as for Forward flushing method, except it only works for locations that use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.<br><br> **Note** <br>If a component uses the Pick + Forward flushing method, it can't have a routing link code to an operation that uses the forward flushing method. The component would then be automatically flushed when the operation starts, which makes it impossible to request the pick activity.|
|Pick + Backward|Same as for Backward flushing method, except it only works for locations use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.|
|Pick + Manual|Require picking if consumption needs to happen at a location where warehouse handling is enabled.|

# <a name="default"></a>Specify a default printer  

After printers have been set up in Business Central, you can then specify which printer you want to use by default for all companies in the environment. There are a couple of ways to specify printers to be used by default for reports and other print jobs. A default printer is useful if you work with different reports that require different printers because of their placement or their output capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only printers that you can specify as default are **Microsoft Print to PDF** and cloud printers that have already been set up for use in Business Central, like Email printers and Universal Print printers. Cloud printers are typically set up by an admin. For more information, see [Printer Setup and Management](admin-printer-setup-overview.md).

## Set a printer as a default printer for all print jobs

Through the **Printer Management** page you set up a printer as a default printer for all print jobs. You can specify the printer as default for you only or for all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the **Printer Management** page from the **Printer Selections** page by choosing **Printer Management**.  
2. On the **Printer Management** page, select a printer from the list, choose **Manage**, then choose **Set as my default printer** or **Set as default printer for all users**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting a default printer from the **Printer Management** adds an entry in the **Printer Selections**.

## Set a default printer for specific reports

The **Printer Selections** page lets you specify the printer a report use by default. Default printers are set on a user-account basis. You can set a default printer for just yourself, another user, or all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Selections**, then select the related link. Alternatively, select a printer on the **Printer Management** page, then choose the **Printer Selections** action.
2. Choose the **New** action to add a printer selection for a specific report.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

The specified report is now set up to print to the selected printer by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When you print the report in question, you can select a different using the **Print** field on the report request page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't set a report up for a specific printer on the **Printer Selections** page, then it's printed to the default printer, as defined on the **Printer Management** page.

You or the administrator can also use the **Printer Selections** page to define other variations of printing for users and reports. The following table describes the combination of values to specify different printing setups for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Print a report to a specific printer for all users |Specify values in the **Report ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **User ID** field blank.|
|Print all reports to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in the **User ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **Report ID** field blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as my default printer** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Set the default printer for all reports for all users|Specify a value in the **Printer Name** field and leave the **User ID** and **Report ID** fields blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as default printer for all users** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Print a specific report to the user's default printer|Specify a value in the **Report ID** field and leave the **Printer Name** and **User ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in all three fields.|

> [!NOTE]
> More specific printer selections take precedence over more general printer selections. For example, a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

## Choosing the printer when running a report

Instead of using the default printer when running a report, you can override this setting from the request page. Simply choose the printer you want to use for this report generation in the **Printer** dropdown menu.

## Sizing print jobs

Cloud printing is designed for documents of a reasonable size. Most cloud services, including PrintNode and HP ePrint, have a limit of 10 MB per job. If you need to print larger reports, you may have to split them in multiple printouts.

# Set Up Shop Calendars

A work center or machine calendar specifies the working days and hours, shifts, holidays, and absences that determine the center’s gross available capacity, measured in time, according to its defined efficiency and capacity values.

As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar, you must first set up one or more general shop calendars. A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation. In addition, the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year.  

The following describes how to set up work center calendars. The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars.  

## To create work shifts  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Shifts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the work shift, for example, **1**.  
3.  Describe the work shift in the **Description** field, for example, **1st shift**.  
4.  Optionally, fill in lines for a second or third work shift.  

Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts, enter at least one work shift code.  

## To set up a shop calendar  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shop Calendars**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the shop calendar.  
3.  Describe the shop calendar in the **Description** field.  
4.  Choose the **Working Days** action.
5.  On the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page, define a complete work week, with the start and end times for each day.  

    In the **Work Shift Code** field, select one of the shifts that you previously defined. Add a line for every working day and every shift. For example:  

    Monday  07:00 15:00 1   
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  

    If you need a shop calendar with two work shifts, you must fill it in in this manner:  

    Monday 07:00 15:00 1   
    Monday 15:00 23:00 2  
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  
    Tuesday 15:00 23:00 2  

    Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar, such as Saturday and Sunday, are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

    When all the working days of a week are defined, you can close the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page and proceed to enter holidays.  

6.  On the **Shop Calendars** page, select the shop calendar, and then choose the **Holidays** action.
7. On the **Shop Calendar Holidays** page, define the holidays of the year by entering the start date and time, the end time, and description of each holiday on individual lines. For example:  

    04/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    05/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    06/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  

The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center.  

## To calculate a work center calendar  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the work center that you want to update.  
3. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select which shop calendar to use as the foundation for a work center calendar.  
4. Choose the **Calendar** action.  
5. On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.  

    The left side of the matrix page lists the work centers that are set up. The right side shows a calendar displaying the available capacity values for each working day in the defined unit of measure, for example, **480** minutes. Each line represents the calendar of one work center.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also select to view the capacity values for each week or month by changing the selection in the **View By** field on the **Work Center Calendar** page.  

    To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center, it must first be calculated.  

6.  Choose the **Calculate** action.  
7.  On the **Work Center** FastTab, you can set a filter to only calculate for one work center. If you do not set a filter, all existing work center calendars will be calculated.  
8.  Define the starting and ending dates of the calendar period that should be calculated, for example, one year from 01/01/14 to 31/12/14.
9. Choose the **OK** button to calculate capacity.  

Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data:  

- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar.  
- The value in the **Capacity** field on the work center card.  
- The value in the **Efficiency** field on the work center card.  

The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center. This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center.  

## To record work center absence  
1.  On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.
2. On the **Work Center Calendar Matrix** page, select the work center and calendar day when the absence time should be recorded, and then choose the **Absence** action.  
3.  On the **Absence** page, define the starting time, ending time, and description of that day’s absence. For example:  

    25/01/01 08:00 10:00 Maintenance  

4.  Choose the **Update** action, and then close the **Absence** page.  

The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time.

# Printer setup and management overview

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Printing documents and reports from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an important task for business users. You typically want to send print jobs directly to one of your organization's printers&mdash;no matter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client or app you're using. Because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is a cloud service, it can't directly reach local printers connected to users' devices, but you can connect it to cloud-enabled printers.

## What are your printer possibilities in Business Central

To support your print needs, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the following features:

|Feature|Description|Web client| Mobile app|App for Teams|
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
|Universal Print|Universal Print is a printer management solution available as a cloud service from Microsoft. With this feature, you can set up your printers in Universal Print, then register them for use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature requires a Universal Print subscription and the **Universal Print Integration** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Email Print|This feature lets you set up email-enabled printers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then sends print jobs to a printer using the printer's email address. This feature requires email-enabled printers, and the **Send to Email Printer** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Browser printing|The print features of your browser handle the print jobs. If a cloud printer isn't installed and set up, or if an installed printer fails, then printing defaults to the printing options for the browser. The **Printer** field on the report request page displays *(Handled by the browser)*.|![works online](media/check.png)|||

Most of the work for setting up printers can be done from the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although with Universal Print printers, you might also have to work in Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Business Central on-premises, Universal Print and Email Print require that Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is used.

## Custom printer extensions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports other custom printer extensions that add even more print features. So if you have any custom printer extensions installed, your application might include print features not described in this article.

If you're an AL developer and want to learn about how to create printer extensions, go to [Developing Printer Extensions in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reports-printing).

# Review amounts in general ledger accounts

You might have general ledger accounts that you frequently keep an eye on. Or you might want to speed up the review process at the end of the month. For help with keeping track of what you've done, and to speed up reviews, use the **Review Entries** action on the **Chart of Accounts** or the **G/L Account Card** page for each account. 

## Set up accounts for reviews

On the **G/L Account Card** page for each account, specify how to allow reviews in the **Review Policy** field.

|Review Policy  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|None     | You can't mark entries for the account as reviewed. For example, use this option for accounts such as payables, receivables, and bank accounts where there are other ways to review their amounts.        |
|Allow Review     | You don't have to include entries in a review, and the amounts of the debit and credit entries don't have to balance. You remove a review, for example, if you've made a mistake.        |
|Allow Review and Match Balance     | The total amounts of the debit and credit entries in the review must match. The **Debit** and **Credit** fields show those amounts, and the **Balance** field shows the total. This setting also lets you remove a review. When you remove a review from one or more entries, the debit and credit entries must still balance.        |

## Mark entries as reviewed

Choose the entries you've reviewed, and then use the **Set selected as reviewed** action. Each time you mark one or more entries as reviewed the entries are given the same number in the **Reviewed Identifier** column. The review identifier is a handy way to keep track of the entries that were reviewed at the same time. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also records the user who did the review, and when they did it.

If you mark entries as reviewed, but regret doing so, use the **Set selected as not reviewed** action.

* If the Review allowed policy is assigned to the account, the action resets the reviewed identifier to 0 and removes the person and date and time of the review. 
* If the Review allowed and match balance policy is assigned, the credit and debit must still balance. For example, if one of the entries in a review is a mistake, you can choose another entry with the correct value. The replacement entry doesn't have to have the same reviewed identifier.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to choose multiple entries is to hold down Ctrl or Shift while you choose the entries. *Ctrl* lets you selects specific entries, and *Shift* selects all entries between the first and last entries you select.

## Review accounts that have old entries

You might have entries from past periods that you've already reviewed or just don't need a review. You just want to start reviewing entries from, for example, the beginning of the year or accounting period. You can leave the entries as is. However, if you want to analyze data in Excel or by using Analysis Mode, mark the entries as reviewed. To learn more about analyzing entries, go to [Analyze entries](#analyze-entries). To mark the entries as reviewed, add a filter on the Filter pane to display only those entries, and then choose the **Mark selected entries as reviewed** action.

## Filter entries

To get a clearer picture, there are several ways to filter entries on the **Review G/L Entries** page.

* Use the **Show Reviewed Entries** and **Hide Reviewed Entries** actions to show only the entries you have or haven't reviewed. To clear the filters, use the **Show all entries** action.
* Use the Filter pane. For example, you might filter by account number or, if you have older entries and want to mark them all as reviewed, by a posting date.

## Analyze entries

There are a couple of ways to analyze the general ledger entries you've reviewed.

* Turn on Analysis Mode, for example, to group entries according to their reviewed identifier. To learn more about Analysis Mode, go to [Analyze List Page Data Using Analysis Mode](analysis-mode.md).
* Export the entries to Excel.

## Customer Table

**Customer Measures**

- [No. of Customers](#no-of-customers)
- [No. of Lost Customers](#no-of-lost-customers)
- [No. of New Customers](#no-of-new-customers)
- [No. of Recovered Customers](#no-of-recovered-customers)
- [No. of Returning Customers](#no-of-returning-customers)
- [Sales Lost Customers (12M)](#sales-lost-customers-12m)
- [Sales New Customers](#sales-new-customers)
- [Sales Recovered Customers](#sales-recovered-customers)
- [Sales Returning Customers](#sales-returning-customers)

### No. of Customers

**Formula**  

Distinct count of the **Customer No.** column from the **Sales** table.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Lost Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were "lost" (stopped purchasing) within the current date selection. It determines the latest date in the selection, prepares a table of customers and their associated "lost" dates, and then filters out the customers whose lost date is within the selected date range. Finally, it counts the rows in this filtered table to get the number of lost customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure counts new customers by finding the date of their first purchase. It includes customers if their first purchase happened within the date selection.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were temporarily "lost" (stopped purchasing) but later made a new purchase. It identifies customers who had a "lost" date before the selected date range, then determines which customers made a new purchase within the current period. The measure filters and counts only those customers whose new purchase occurred after their lost date, returning the total number of recovered customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who made a repeat purchase during the current period. It identifies existing customers by filtering customers whose first purchase was before the selected date range, then determines which of these customers made another purchase within the current period. The measure returns the count of these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Lost Customers (12M)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales lost over the past 12 months due to customers who stopped purchasing ("lost" customers). It first identifies the most recent "lost" date, then filters customers who were lost before that date. It gets the sales from the previous 12 months for these lost customers and calculates the total revenue they generated before they stopped purchasing.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales from customers who made their first purchase within the current date range. It identifies each customer's first purchase date, filters out customers whose first purchase occurred during the selected period, and then sums the sales amount from those new customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by recovered customers. Recovered customers were previously lost but made a purchase afterward. It identifies temporarily lost customers, checks whether they made a new purchase in the current period, and then sums the sales figures for them.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by returning customers. Returning customers are customers who made their first purchase before the current period and made more purchases in the current period. It identifies returning customers by finding the intersection of active customers and customers who purchased previously, and then sums the sales from these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Amount PP (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure determines the appropriate sales amount based on the current context of the date hierarchy in the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to evaluate whether the context is at the fiscal month, fiscal quarter, or fiscal year level. Depending on which level is active, it returns the corresponding sales amount, which is either:

- Previous month (Sales Amount PM (Fiscal))
- Previous quarter (Sales Amount PQ (Fiscal))
- Previous year (Sales Amount PY (Fiscal))

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

### Sales Amount POP (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the change in sales between the current period and the previous period based on the context of the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to determine the appropriate previous period calculation depending on whether the current context is at the fiscal month, quarter, or year level. When at the fiscal month level, it references the month-over-month change from the Sales Amount MOM (Fiscal) measure, which computes the difference between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales. Similarly, for fiscal quarters and years, it uses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year calculations, respectively.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

### Sales Amount POP % (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the percentage growth in sales between the current and previous period based on the context of the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to determine the appropriate previous period calculation depending on whether the current context is at the fiscal month, quarter, or year level. When at the fiscal month level, it references the month-over-month change from the Sales Amount MOM % (Fiscal) measure, which determines the percentage growth between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales. Similarly, for fiscal quarters and years, it uses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year calculations, respectively.

# Set up sustainability features

To use the sustainability features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Role Center  

If your primary responsibilities involve sustainability processes, we recommend that you use the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center. It gives easy access to the core features of sustainability, and the finance and procurement processes. It also shows the most important sustainability-related key performance indicators (KPIs).

To configure the Role Center, follow the steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **My settings**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Role** field, select the **Available Roles** page.
3. Choose **Sustainability Manager**.
4. Select **OK**.

## Sustainability setup  

Specify some general settings for sustainability, such as the unit of measure for emissions, the decimal places for amounts, and whether some fields are mandatory.

To configure these settings, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the required fields that are related to sustainability.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register emissions. |
    | **Waste Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the the waste unit of measure code that you use to register waste intensity. |
    | **Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the water unit of measure code that you use to register water intensity. |
    | **Disch. Into Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register discharged into water. |
    | **Emission Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for emission amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, means that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places are shown for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Country/Region Mandatory** | Make the country/region field mandatory. You can set the country/region field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the country/region field before posting. |
    | **Responsibility Center Mandatory** | Make the responsibility center mandatory. The responsibility center can be used as a facility, so that you can measure facility-based emissions. You can set the responsibility center field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the responsibility center field before posting. |
    | **Block Calculation Foundation Change If Ledger Entries Exist** | Prevent changes to the calculation foundation (formula) at the account category level when the formula was already applied to sustainability entries. |
    | **Enable Background Error Check** | Enable validations for sustainability journal lines. The validations run in the background. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you turn on or turn off validations in journals, sign in again before you start the new setup.

3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields that are required to use sustainability features in the purchase process.  

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** | Enable sustainability related fields and features to appear on purchase documents, such as **Sustainability Account** or different emissions. |
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable posting of **Sustainability Value Entries** through value chain operations and the visibility of sustainability related fields in operational documents and journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default **Sustainability Account** on the **G/L Account** card page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item** card page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item Charge** (currently not operating) page. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Specifies the enablement of default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** field makes the **Sustainability Account** and emission fields on purchase documents. However, when you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates **Sustainability Ledger Entries**. To activate posting to the **Sustainability Value Entries** and enable value chain tracking, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field.

4. On the **Calculations** FastTab, configure the required fields for the formulas that calculate emissions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Fuel/Electricity Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for fuel/electricity amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Distance Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for distance measurements. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Custom Amount Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for custom amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |

5. On the **Reporting** FastTab, complete the setup by configuring the fields that are related to reporting to authorities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In version 24.0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support reporting to any authorities. The fields that are related to the configuration of this functionality on the **Reporting** FastTab are intended for future reporting capabilities. However, partners can also use these fields in localized versions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Reporting Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to report emissions. You can use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. This field isn't applicable to the standard reports. |
    | **Reporting UOM Factor** | Enter the unit of measure factor that you use to register emissions, if you use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Precision** | Enter the size of the interval that you use to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Type** | Choose how to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |

## Emission fees

To track internal carbon fees or calculate your emissions using carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, configure the **Emission Fees** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission you want to configure: **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**. This field is mandatory.
3. Specify the **Scope Type**. If you leave this field blank, it applies to all scopes, but you can configure it for each scope.  
4. Specify a **Starting Date** and **Ending Date**. These dates let you use different configurations for different periods.
5. The **Country/Region Code** and **Responsibility Code** are optional fields that you can use if you want to have different carbon fees or carbon equivalent factors per country/region or per facility (responsibility center).
6. The **Carbon Fee** field represents the internal carbon fee that a company charges itself for each unit of CO2 equivalent that it emits. You can use this field based on some local or regional regulations, or for internal calculations. The **Carbon Fee** is calculated every time you post emissions. This information displays on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, without more posting to the **G/L Ledger**. You can set up **Carbon Fee** per unit of measure that you have in the **Sustainability Setup**, and you can fill this field only for the line where the **Emission Type** is **CO2**.
7. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential. If the **Emission Type** is CO2, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always *1* and you can't modify this value because CO2 is the reference gas used for calculating the global warming potential (GWP) of other GHGs. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to *1*. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.
To calculate the carbon equivalent factor, use the following example. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to add is 0.00336.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** isn't calculated based on the **CO2 Emission** values. Instead, as a foundation for this formula, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **CO2e Emission** field. The **CO2e Emission** field is calculated based on all emissions posted to an entry. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is configured for each of the gases on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!TIP]
> To use CO2e for all emissions (*CO2e of CO2*, *CO2e of CH4*, and *CO2e of N2O*), set the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** to **1** for the **CO2**, **CH4**, and **N2O** options. This setting gives you CO2e for all emissions, and the **CO2e** field displays the total carbon equivalent.  

If you didn't configure the **Emission Fees** before you posted sustainability entries, and you want to calculate your carbon fees and CO2e retroactively, run the **Calculate Emission Fees** action to update values on the sustainability ledger entries.  

## Responsibility Center

Use the **Responsibility Center** to post entries related to sustainability, where it represents a specific facility. However, if you want to use water management in sustainability, configure some additional information. You can set up your responsibility center as usual, and fill in the fields on the **Sustainability** FastTab as described in the following table.  

| Field | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Water Capacity Dimension** | Specifies the capacity dimension. For example, Area or Volume. |
| **Water Capacity Quantity (Month)** | Indicates the total water capacity quantity of the responsibility center. |
| **Water Capacity Unit** | Specifies the unit of measure that describes capacity quantity. |

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.
  * Document Date
  * Sell-to Customer No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# User Access Flow for Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes what happens when a user accesses Business Central data using their Microsoft 365 license for the first time. Understanding this flow allows administrators to plan their approach and configure Business Central to match their business needs.

1. First, the user’s identity is authenticated 
2. Business Central verifies that all the [minimum requirements](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#minimum-requirements) are met.
3. Business Central verifies that this user does not have a greater license, such as a Business Central license or an administrative role such as a delegated admin role. 
4. Business Central verifies whether the user is accessing data that belongs to an environment that has enabled access with Microsoft 365 licenses. 
5. The user record is provisioned in Business Central, assigning the User Group, Profile and Permission Sets defined in the Microsoft 365 license configuration page. By default, the Teams Users user group is assigned, the Employee profile is assigned, and only the Login permission set is assigned. Any other defaulting of user settings is also applied, just like a licensed Business Central user. 
6. The full Business Central security model is applied, to determine whether the user should be able to access the record, page, in the specified company and specified environment. 

If all steps succeed, the user can now view this Business Central data in Teams. The Business Central service automatically ensures read-only access and simplifies the UI. 

The user account is now registered in Business Central and can be managed like any Business Central user.

> [!NOTE]
> Steps may vary depending on any additional security configuration that you have specified in Microsoft 365 or Business Central.

# Dispose of or retire fixed assets

When you sell or otherwise dispose of a fixed asset, you must post the disposal value to calculate and record the gain or loss. A disposal entry must be the last entry posted for a fixed asset. For partially disposed fixed assets, you can post more than one disposal entry. The total of all posted disposal amounts must be a credit amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you trade-in a fixed asset for another one, you must record both the sale of the old asset (disposal) and the purchase of the new one (acquisition). For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

The following steps assume that your posting groups are set up on the **FA Posting Groups** page. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  

## To post a disposal from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Disposal**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for disposal posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Disposal Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Disposal Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

If you sell or dispose of part of a fixed asset, you must split up the asset before you can record the disposal transaction. For more information, see [Transfer, Split, or Combine Fixed Assets](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md).  

## To view disposal ledger entries

When you sell or dispose of a fixed asset, the disposal value is posted to the general ledger where you can view the result.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.  
3. Select the depreciation book that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
4. Select a line with **Disposal** in the **FA Posting Category** field, and then choose the **Find Entries** action.  
5. On the **Find Entries** page, select the general ledger entry line, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.  

The **General Ledger Entries** page opens where you can see the entries that the disposal posting resulted in.

# Personalize your workspace

You can personalize your workspace to suit your work and preferences. Change pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. Personalization affects only your workspace. It doesn't change how others work. You can personalize all types of pages, including the [role center](ui-change-basic-settings.md#role-center) page.

The adjustments outlined in this article are applied universally across all your devices and browsers. There are other modifications, not detailed here, that only affect the specific device and browser on which they're made. Learn more about the differences in [Where is personalization stored?](ui-personalization-stored.md).

## Video and training

The following video shows some of the ways in which you can personalize your Role Center.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=d76e5d60-ecc2-462b-bba2-18d6deee3534]

For online training, go to [Personalize the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central user interface](/training/modules/personalize-ui-dynamics-365-business-central/).

## About personalization

You can make various adjustments, such as move or hide fields, columns, actions, and entire parts, and add new fields. You do most adjustments by first activating the **Personalizing** banner using the [personalization mode](#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode). You can also readily make the following adjustments on any list page without using the personalization mode:

- [Resize a column](#resize-a-column)
- [Create, rename, or edit a view](ui-views.md)
- [Bookmark the page](ui-bookmarks.md)
- [Hide or resize a FactBox](#hide-or-resize-a-factbox)
- Expand/collapse hierarchical list

### Resize a column

There are two ways to change the width of a column in any list, including in dropdown lists for looking up field values:

- Select and drag the boundary between two columns in the header of a list.
- Double-click the boundary between two columns to autofit the width of the column. The width adjusts to the optimal size for readability.

### Hide or resize a FactBox

A FactBox is a pane along the right side of a page that displays more information related to the record on the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/factbox.png" alt-text="Shows the FactBox position in the web client":::

- To hide or show the FactBox, select the ![Shows the collapse or expand FactBox icon in Business Central](media/collapse-expand-factbox.png) **Collapse/Expand the FactBox pane** icon at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To resize the FactBox, drag the vertical divider between the FactBox and main content. Double-click the divider to reset the width to default.

   If you can't resize the FactBox, you're either using Business Central version earlier than 26.0, or **Feature: Optimize screen estate usage for web** isn't turned on in **Feature Management**. Contact your admin, or learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

## Start personalizing by using the personalization mode

1. Open any page that you want to personalize.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") and then choose the **Personalize** action.

    The **Personalizing** banner appears at the top to indicate that you can start making changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

    If you see **Personalize lock** ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") or **Personalization blocked** ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") on the banner, you can't personalize the page. For more information, see [Why a Page is Locked from Personalization](ui-personalization-locked.md).

1. To change a user interface (UI) element, point to the element, such as an action, a field, or a part. The element is immediately highlighted with an arrowhead or border. Choose the element, and then choose either **Move**, **Remove**, **Hide**, **Show**, **Show under "Show more"**, **Show when collapsed**, **Show always**, **Set/Clear Freeze Pane**, or **Include/Exclude from Quick Entry**, depending on the type and state of the UI element.
1. To add a field, choose the **+ Field** action. From the **Add Field to Page** pane, drag and drop a field into the desired position on the page.
1. When you finish changing the layout of one or more pages, choose **Done** on the **Personalizing** banner.

For more information, see [What You Can Personalize](#What).

## <a name="Actions"></a>Personalize action bar and menus

Personalization lets you decide which actions to show on the navigation and action bars and on Role Centers, and where to show them. You can show, hide, or move individual actions or action groups.

The following video shows how you can personalize actions on pages and Role Centers.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=88d1055a-6b3d-4767-bbf7-98a78170e394]

Personalizing the navigation and action bars is done basically the same as with other UI elements. However, what you can do with an action or group depends on where the action or group is located. The best way to find out is to enter personalizing mode and then let the arrowheads guide you.

There are a couple of terms that you should be familiar with to better understand action personalization: *action group* and *promoted category*.  

An *action group* is an element that expands to display other actions or groups. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, one action group is the **Functions** action that appears when you choose the **Actions** action.

A *promoted category* is an action group that appears before the vertical line `|` on the action bar. The categories typically include the most commonly used actions, so that you can quickly find them. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, the **Order**, **Release**, and **Posting** actions are promoted categories.

> [!NOTE]  
> To clear personalization, select the arrowhead around the part's designer menu, and then choose **Clear personalization**.

### Remove, hide, and show actions and action groups

When you want to show or hide an action, the options under the arrowhead define what you can do depending on the action's state. 

1. Choose the arrowhead for an action or action group.
2. Choose from one of the following options:

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Remove**|This option appears if the selected action is also shown somewhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Choosing this option deletes the action from the selected location so that it no longer appears. The action or action group remains in the other locations. |
   |**Hide**|This option appears if the action or action group isn't located anywhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Like **Remove**, choosing this option makes the action or action group disappear from the navigation bar or action bar. However, in personalizing mode, the action, or action group is still shown in the current position, except that it appears dimmed.|
   |**Show**|This option appears if the action or action group is hidden (dimmed). Choosing this option makes the action or action group appear on the navigation bar or action bar.|

### Move actions and action groups

A horizontal line between two actions or a border around an action group indicates where you can drop actions or actions groups. There are the following limitations:

- You can move individual actions into the promoted categories, but you can't rearrange the order of the actions in the category.
- You can't move an action group into a promoted category.

To move an action or action group, drag and drop it into the desired position, like you do with fields and columns.

To move an action or action group into another action group that is empty, drag the action or action group to the new group and drop it in the **Drop an action here** box.

### About the Automate menu

- You can't hide or move the **Automate** menu or the **Power Automate** submenu and its actions.
- You can move flows included under the **Automate** item, but you can't hide them using personalization. Moving the flow makes a copy the flow in the destination, it doesn't remove it from the **Automate** item.

> [!TIP]
> As an administrator, you can hide the **Automation** item from users. Learn more at [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

## <a name="Parts"></a>Personalize parts

Hover over or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to get information about a field.

Parts are areas on a page that are typically composed of multiple fields, charts, or other content. A part shows a colored border when you focus on the part. For example, a Role Center home screen has multiple parts. Because of their well-defined boundary, you can personalize the entire part and its contents.

- To move a part, drag and drop it into the desired position. A colored line indicates valid positions on the screen. For example, FactBoxes can only be moved next to other FactBoxes in the FactBox pane.
- You can hide a part by choosing the **Hide** option under the arrowhead.
- When you start personalizing or navigate to a new page, any parts that are currently hidden appear on the page with distinctive visuals to indicate they're hidden. You can unhide that part by choosing the **Show** option under the arrowhead.

You can clear all personalization changes that you made within a single part by choosing the **Clear personalization** option under the part's arrowhead. Clearing personalization of a part only affects changes to the contents of the part. It doesn't affect the placement or visibility of the part on the page.  

## <a name="fields"></a> Work with fields and columns

When personalizing a page, you use the **Add field to page** pane to include fields or columns on the page that are currently hidden from view. To open this pane, select the **+ Field** action near the top of the page. Unlike other hidden elements, hidden fields aren't indicated on the page itself in personalization mode. However, you can identify hidden fields by using the **Add field to page** pane.

Here are some general guidelines to follow when using the **Add field to page** pane:

- By default, the pane lists all hidden fields. To find hidden fields, look for the ![Shows the hidden field icon](media/hidden-icon.png "Shows the hidden field icon") icon.
- You can filter the list to show other fields, for example, those fields currently shown on the page, by selecting the **Recommended fields** button above the list and choosing a filter option. The name of the button changes based on the filter option you choose.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/personlaization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the personalization mode.":::
- Selecting a field in the list highlights its location on the page. If the field is hidden, its location shows in a shaded state.
- To get more details about a field in the list, hover over it or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to display a tooltip.
- The fields available in the **Add field to page** pane are determined by the developer of the page and its source table or by a profile admin who [customized the page](ui-personalization-manage.md). You can't create new ones.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.

### Add a field so it's visible on the page

From the **Add field to page** pane, there are two ways to include a hidden field on the page:

- Drag the field to the desired position. A thick horizontal or vertical line indicates the target location.
- Select the field in the list, then go to the shaded field on the page and select the **Show** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Some fields that you add won't be editable on the page when you're done with personalization. These fields are either originally designed this way or an administrator [customized](ui-personalization-manage.md) the page to prevent you from editing them.

## Clear personalization

At some point, you might want to undo some or all of the personalization changes that you made to a page over time.

1. On the **Personalizing** banner, choose the **Clear personalization** action.
2. Choose one of the following options.  

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Clearing personalization can't be undone.

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Only Navigation Menu**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the navigation menu that is shared across the Role Center and other pages. Such changes include any new actions that were added as bookmarks, and any changes to links and groups in the menu.|  
   |**Only Actions**|Clears any personalization changes that you made on the navigation or action bars on the page.|
   |**Only Fields and Columns**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the page except changes on the navigation or action bars. Such changes include changes to fields, columns, parts, and tiles. |
   |**All**|Clears all personalization changes that you made to the page so it looks like it did originally. Such changes include changes to navigation and action bars, fields, columns, parts, and tiles.|

## Tips and other points of interest

To help you better understand personalization, here are some pointers:

- When you make changes to a card page that you open from a list, the changes take effect on all records that you open from that list. For example, let's say you open a specific customer from the Customers list page, and then personalize the page by adding a field. When you open other customers from the list, the field that you added is also shown.
- Changes that you make affect all your Role Centers. For example, if you make a change to the Customer list when the Role Center is set to Business Manager, you also see the change on the **Customers** page when the Role Center is set to Sales Order Processor.
- Changes to a page in a pane take effect on the page wherever it appears.  
- You can't personalize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you happen to switch to personalization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analysis mode is automatically switched off.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.
- If a part or group is hidden, ghosted fields still show inside it, but you can't drag-and-drop or add/show that field until you make the group/part visible.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to restrictions on design capabilities in the web client, it's currently not possible to customize or personalize the controls within the `grid` and `fixed` syntax. It applies to all design modes, not just personalization.
>
> Administrators can make the same layout changes as users by customizing a profile (role), which can be assigned to multiple users. To learn more about pages for Roles, go to [Customize Pages for Roles](ui-personalization-manage.md)<br /><br />
Administrators can also override or disable users' personalization, and they can define which features are even available for users to see in all or specific companies. For more information, see [Customize Business Central](ui-customizing-overview.md).

# Use item references

If you buy or sell items that you and your vendor or customer use different terms for, then you can set up a reference between your terms for the items and the terms that the customer or vendor of that item uses. This way, the vendor's or customer's item description, unit of measure, or variant code is automatically inserted on the relevant documents when you fill in the **Item Reference No.** field.  

## To set up an item reference

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to create a reference.
3. Choose the **Item References** action.

     If you can't find the **Item References** action, choose to view more options, and then find it under **Related** > **Item**.
  
4. On a new line on the **Item Reference Entries** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

The following procedure describes how you specify the item reference on a purchase order. Similar steps apply to sales documents and other purchase documents.  

## To enter a vendor's item description on a document

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase order for the vendor that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
3. Create a purchase line for the item that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
4. In the item reference **No.** field, select the relevant item reference, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Description** field on the line is overwritten with the vendor's item description, as set up on the item reference entry. If the item reference includes a variant code or a unit of measure, these values are also copied to the document.  

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

The following table lists the pages that support barcode scanning of item references from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

|Page  |Field value you can scan  |
|---------|---------|
|Item Reference     | Reference No.        |
|Item Journal Line     | Item Reference No.        |
|Phys. Invt. Order Line     |Item Reference No.         |
|Purchase Line     |   Item Reference No.      |
|Sales Line     | Item Reference No.        |

# Moving Items

You can move items in your warehouse in different ways, depending on how you've configured your warehouse. The complexity can vary:

* Small warehouses might use basic warehouse configurations to handle orders individually, in a single or multiple steps.
* Large warehouses might use advanced configurations where all warehouse activities are coordinated by a directed workflow. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

Items may need to be moved between bins, for example, due to internal operations:

* A production order needs components delivered, or its finished items put away.
* A warehouse manager wants to optimize space.
* Unplanned movements to and from operations.
* Replenish picking bins or shop floor bins.
* Update bin contents.

Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items can involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with item ledger entries. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Need more time to decide whether to subscribe?

It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation, you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You can't extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again, which is also a one-time thing. If you aren't already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

## To extend your trial period

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).

    Sign in with the email account that you used when you signed up for the trial.  

    If you signed up with an email account from a [30-day trial of Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/commerce/sign-up-for-office-365-trial), then you must first extend your Microsoft 365 trial, or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription. For more information, see [Extend your trial for Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/extend-your-trial).
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.

    If you dismissed the notification, you must sign out and then sign in again.

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the notification, you can force [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to run the **Extend Trial** assisted setup guide by adding the ```?page=1828``` parameter to the URL, such as in the following example: [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828)

## What happens if my trial period is expired?

If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification.  

After you create your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company.  

If your organization has a reseller relationship with a partner, they can sign in to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a delegated administrator and run the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. For more information, see [Extending trials (as an administrator)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration#extending-trials).  

However, after this second extension gives your organization up to 90 days of trial, you must either subscribe to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or stop using it. If you decide to not continue, we recommend that you export any data that you rely on in your business.

When your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. 90 days after the extended trial expires, we'll delete your company and data unless you subscribe.

# Development of Validated Localization apps

This article describes the requirements and guidelines for developing a Validated Localization app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is a Validated Localization app?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available [globally in 170+ markets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json). In some markets, Microsoft works with independent software vendor (ISV) partners to localize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through localization apps that we make available on [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For those regions, localizations can be available through preferred localization app program. Preferred localization apps program recognizes those apps, which are built according to Microsoft quality guidelines. ISV partners who comply with those program requirements and guidelines can benefit technically and commercially to serve their resellers and customers.  

In the following sections, you can find requirements and guidelines. You can reach out to the program team if you want to participate in this program and comply with the below requirements by contacting us through [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Validated Localization apps initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot program. The following requirements and benefits can change based upon the partner and customer feedback.  

Apps in the Validated Localization pilot program contain a set of functionalities addressing local regulatory requirements that fall within one of the categories in the following list.  

- **Regulatory requirements** - local functionality that helps businesses fulfill their legal requirements, such as tax reporting, local E-invoicing formats, local GAAP, and other regulatory requirements.
- **National standards requirement** – local functionality that addresses local standards, such as address formats, national banking formats, or local interpretations of global standards.
- **Local language** - local language in the localization app, but also for a base app if this language isn't currently on the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Local market needs or industry requirements should not be included in the preferred localization apps. If apps contain these functionalities, the apps can't be approved as Validated Localization apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Local functionality is beneficial to the productivity business processes in a country and thereby adds value to a business but isn't required from a regulatory perspective, such as specific banking and payment formats, expense reports, HR features, and payroll. Similar smaller or bigger, and nice-to-have features should be isolated into other apps. If apps contain these functionalities, they aren't approved as Validated Localization apps.

## Validated Localization app business requirements  

- The Validated Localization App provider complies with all requirements to be a CSP indirect provider.  
- The Validated Localization App provider brings to market a minimum of offerings across five countries/regions, which bundle Dynamics 365 Business Central with a Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider has a minimum of 10 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers with production environments, which are actively using the Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider submits a business plan on a yearly basis to the program v-team. The plan includes planned marketing and readiness activities to promote the bundled offering with the CSP Indirect Resellers in applicable countries/regions. Plan can be submitted at the start of each quarter to [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).  
- The Validated Localization Apps are available to all customers and partners who want to benefit from them.
- The Validated Localization App provider engages in recurring workstreams with Microsoft.
- The Validated Localization App provider must maintain its status as an Embedded Localization Partner.  
- The Validated Localization App provider agrees to continuously adhere to the business, functional, and technical requirements outlined on this page.

## Validated Localization app functional and technical requirements  

### Functionality requirements

In addition to the technical requirements for the preferred localization app, the minimum viable product scope for preferred localization app is:  

- Local Regulatory Features:  
  - Legal requirements.
  - Officially mandatory features.
  - Horizontal only features (not industry-specific).  
  - Applicable in most businesses.  
  - Within the following blueprint:
    - Areas of the most frequent legislative changes.
    - Already tracked as a localization in Microsoft localizations.
    - Feature references – seldom new.  
    - No vendor or bank specific formats, payroll, or similar.
    - No global features not built by Microsoft.
- Translations:
  - Translation of a localization app to local languages.
  - Translation of a base app to local languages if the language isn't already [supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  
  - Translation of the localization app's documentation to local languages.
- Even though they're both part of localization, we recommended that National Standard Features (local part) are built as separate apps from Local Regulatory Features.
- Demo data in the local language for the specific market.
- All features must be designed with a basic user interface. They're intended primarily for the SMB market.  
- Avoid building new features if the same or similar functionality is already in the base app. For example, electronic invoicing, audit exports, VAT features, data exchange, and others. Most of the functionality is common to all countries/regions, but there are local rules or business formats that are extensions of global frameworks or formats. Instead of building new features, extend existing ones.  
- Prepare setup guides (wizards) for areas that are complex to set up to help users enable, discover, and have good first experience using your localization app.  
- Partners must provide functional documentation for all aspects of their localization.  

### Technical requirements  

The following are requirements that you must meet before submitting the Validated Localization app as an extension for validation. This list doesn’t change the [technical validation list](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission) and only extends requirements from there.  

- Providers must build the Validated Localization app based on the W1 base app.  
- Providers must follow Microsoft lifecycle and support policies.   
- Mandatory test automation must cover a minimum 80% of code and all business processes that change with the Validated Localization app must be covered by test automation.  
- Providers must update and/or test its Validated Localization app before the official launch of new release (minimum with the RC before new release) to confirm there are no issues. 
- All objects in the Validated Localization app code must be in English.   
- The Validated Localization app providers must follow Microsoft policy for obsolete objects and breaking changes and best practices for deprecation of the AL Code.  
- The Validated Localization app providers should add new events if required by the market (other implementation partners or customers) if it makes reasonable business sense. The events must follow Microsoft policy and practice. Otherwise, the validated localization app providers must provide a response to justify why it doesn't make reasonable business sense to add them.
- The Validated Localization app providers must provide written test scenarios in English and enable Microsoft to do manual testing if required by Microsoft.  
- If a Validated Localization app extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data model with new tables and/or fields, the Validated Localization app provider must set the **DataClassification** property correctly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create an integration if you find it beneficial to have some functionality placed outside the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and instead connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using for example, APIs or web services.

# Process Sales Opportunities

After you create an opportunity, there are several features for managing the opportunity and moving it through to completion.

## View opportunities

Existing sale opportunities are available on the **Opportunity List** page. The following table describes ways to access the page to process sales opportunities.

| To view opportunities for | Then |
| --- | --- |
| All salespeople and contacts |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunity List**, and then choose the related link. |
| A specific sales person |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link. Select the salesperson, choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose the **List** action. |
| A specific contact |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link. Select the contact from the list, and then choose the **Opportunities** action. |

Each of these tasks opens the **Opportunity List** page.

## Close opportunities

You can close opportunities when the negotiations are over. When you close an opportunity, you can specify whether it was won or lost, and the reasons for closing it. To specify a reason, you must set up closed opportunity codes.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and the choose the **Close** action. The **Close Opportunity** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

   The **Close Opportunity Code** and **Date Closed** fields are required fields and must be filled in before you can choose the **OK** button.

   In the **Close Opportunity Code** field, you can choose from one of the existing close opportunity codes or add a new code. To add a new code, from the drop-down list, choose **Select from full list**, and then choose **new**. On the new blank line, fill in the **Code**, **Type**, and **Description** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Create quotes for opportunities

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sales quotes from opportunities where the contact type is Company.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.

## Create sales orders for opportunities

You can make sales orders from the sales quotes that you have created for your opportunities. Before you can create sales orders for your contacts, you must create the contact as a customer. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, find the opportunity that you have created a sales quote for.
2. Choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens to show the sales quote that you have assigned to the opportunity.
3. Fill in the additional fields, and then choose the **Make Order** action.

When handling sales opportunities, you may need to create a quote for the contact that the opportunity is linked to.

## Delete opportunities

You can delete opportunities, for example, after you conclude a deal. However, you can only delete closed opportunities. There are two ways to delete closed opportunities. You can delete individual closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page or you can run the **Delete Opportunities** batch job to delete multiple opportunities based on specified criteria.

To delete closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Delete** action.

To delete closed opportunities by using the **Delete Opportunities** batch job, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Administration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Delete Opportunities** action, and then set the filters that specify the closed opportunities to delete.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

After you delete an opportunity, it's removed it from the **Opportunity List** page.

## Move an opportunity through sales cycle stages

If an opportunity follows a sales cycle, you can move it to the next or previous stage, and even skip a stage.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, choose the **Update** action. The **Update Opportunity** opens,
2. Use the **Action Type** field to move the opportunity through the sales cycle stages:
   * **Next** moves the opportunity forward one stage.
   * **Skip** moves the opportunity forward one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field. You can only skip stages that have been set up to allow skipping.
   * **Previous** moves the opportunity back one stage.
   * **Jump** moves the opportunity back one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field.
   * **Update** enables you to change information (such as to modify your evaluation of their chances of success and estimated values) without moving to another stage.
3. Fill in the other fields as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Walkthrough: Picking and Shipping in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbount Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require pick processing but not ship processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post pick and ship information for your outbound source documents. The outbound source document can be a sales order, purchase return order, outbound transfer order, or a production order with component need.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up SOUTH location for inventory picks.  
- Creating a sales order for customer 10000 for 30 Amsterdam Lamps.  
- Releasing the sales order for warehouse handling.  
- Creating an inventory pick based on a released source document.  
- Registering the warehouse movement from the warehouse and at the same time posting the sales shipment for the source sales order.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Warehouse Worker  

<!-- ## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, a company based on the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option in a sandbox environment. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, CRONUS installed.
 -->

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, sets up SOUTH warehouse for basic pick handling where warehouse workers process outbound orders individually. Susan, the order processor, creates a sales order for 30 units of item 1928-S to be shipped to customer 10000 from the SOUTH Warehouse. John, the warehouse worker must make sure that the shipment is prepared and delivered to the customer. John manages all involved tasks on the **Inventory Pick** page, which automatically points to the bins where 1928-S is stored.

[!INCLUDE[set_up_location.md](includes/set_up_location.md)]

### Setting Up the Bin Codes

Once you have the location set up, you must add two bins.

#### To setup the bin codes

1. Select the **Bins** action.
2. Create two bins, with the codes *S-01-0001* and *S-01-0002*.

### Making Yourself a Warehouse Employee at Location SOUTH

In order to use this functionality, you must add yourself to the location as a warehouse worker. 

#### To make yourself a warehouse employee

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature first.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Warehouse Employees** page.
  3. In the **Location Code** field, choose SOUTH.  
  4. Select the **Default** field, and then select the **Yes** button.  

### Making Item 1928-S Available

To make item 1928-S available at the SOUTH location follow these steps:  

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature second.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Open the default journal, and then create two item journal lines with the following information about the work date (January 23).  

        |Entry Type|Item Number|Location Code|Bin Code|Quantity|  
        |----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0001|20|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0002|20|  

        By default, the **Bin Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

  3. Choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, and then choose **Post**.  
  4. Select the **Yes** button.  

## Creating the Sales Order

Sales orders are the most common type of outbound source document.  

### To create the sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature third.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a sales order for customer 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following sales order line.  

    |Item|Location Code|Quantity|

    |1928-S|SOUTH|30|  

     Proceed to notify the warehouse that the sales order is ready for warehouse handling.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    John proceeds to pick and ship the sold items.  

## Picking and Shipping Items

On the **Inventory Pick** page, you can manage all outbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a sales order. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To pick and ship items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature fourth.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Sales Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the sale to customer 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the sales order.  
5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 20 respectively on the two inventory pick lines.

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

>[!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Row group</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Columns that only have a few possible values are the best candidates for using in column **Values**.

## Want to Export data to Excel?

Right-click on the data area or a selection of cells to export data.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-export-to-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to export data from an analysis to Excel":::


## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

# Setting up and troubleshooting your browser to work with Business Central Web Client

This article explains how to set up your browser so that the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] and all its features work properly. Read this article if you're having problems opening the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)], your browser's settings can be the cause of some problems.

The article provides details for setting up Microsoft Edge, but the requirements for JavaScript, cookies, and pop-ups are the same for all supported browsers. For other browsers, refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  

## Use a supported browser

Make sure to use a one of the supported browsers. See [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#browsers).

We recommend that you use a stable channel version of a web browser as it's the most reliable and stable version that has undergone extensive testing and bug fixing. This ensures that you have the best experience and are less likely to encounter any issues while using the web client.  

## Allow JavaScript from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow JavaScript, you see **NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript** in the address bar and an **HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found** message when you try to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the 

<!-- http://localhost:8080/NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found
The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. -->

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **JavaScript**.
2. Do one of the following steps. Choose the step that your organization recommends:

    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the left (Off). Then, select **Add** and type the address (URL) for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the **Site** box. Select **Add** when done.
    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the right (On).

## Allow cookies from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow cookies, you get the following error:

**Sorry, the page could not be found. Please check the address and try again.** 

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and site data**.
2. Move the **Allow sites to save and read cookie data** toggle to the right (On).  

## <a name="popup"></a>Allow pop-ups from Business Central

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with several products. In some cases, like with Microsoft Teams, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens, or "pop-ups," within the product. This capability requires that your browser allows pop-ups from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

*Problem:*

If pop-ups for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are being blocked, you get a message similar to the following message:

**Something went wrong. Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.**

<!--
Something went wrong
Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.

Change your browser settings to allow pop-ups or allow this for trusted domains, then try again.
If these settings are managed for your organization, you should contact your administrator for assistance.

Try again
-->
*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Pop-ups and redirects**.
2. Move the **Blocked** toggle to the right (On).
3. Select **Add**. In the **Site** box, type `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then select **Add**.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About this walkthrough  

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use the **Inventory Put-away** page to record and post put-away and receipt information for your inbound source documents. The following documents are inbound source documents:

* Purchase order
* Sales return order
* Inbound transfer order
* Production order with output that's ready to be put away

> [!NOTE]
> Even though the settings are called **Require Pick** and **Require Put-away**, you can still post receipts and shipments directly from the source business documents at locations where you select these checkboxes.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

* Set up SILVER location for inventory put aways.  
* Set up SILVER location for bin handling.  
* Define a default bin for item LS-81. (LS-75 is already set up in CRONUS.)  
* Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 for 40 loudspeakers.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are preset by setup.  
* Release the purchase order for warehouse handling.  
* Create an inventory put-away based on a released source document.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are inherited from the purchase order.  
* Register the warehouse movement into the warehouse and post the purchase receipt for the source purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Roles  

The following user roles perform the tasks that this walkthrough demonstrates:  

* Warehouse Manager  
* Purchasing Agent  
* Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites  

To complete this walkthrough, you'll need:  

* CRONUS International Ltd. data  
* To be a warehouse employee at SILVER location. To set yourself up, follow these steps:  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your user account on the **Users** page.  
    3. In the **Location Code** field, choose **SILVER**.  
    4. Select the **Default** checkbox.  

## Story  

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS International Ltd., creates a purchase order for 10 units of item LS-75 and 30 units of item LS-81 from vendor 10000 to be delivered to SILVER Warehouse. When the delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, puts the items away in the default bins defined for the items. When John posts the put-away, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

## Setting up the location  

Settings on the **Location Card** page define the company's warehouse flows.  

### To set up the location  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the SILVER location card.  
3. Turn on the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

    Set up a default bin for the two item numbers to control where they're put away.  

4. Choose the **Bins** action.  
5. Select the first row, for bin **S-01-0001**, and then choose the **Contents** action.  

    Notice on the **Bin Content** page that item **LS-75** is already set up as content in bin S-01-0001.  

6. Choose the **New** action.  
7. Select the **Fixed** and the **Default** fields.  
8. In the **Item No.** field, enter **LS-81**.  

## Create the purchase order  

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Bin code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |LS_75|SILVER|S-01-0001|10|  
    |LS-81|SILVER|S-01-0001|30|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The bin code is entered automatically according to the setup you created in the [Setting up the location](#setting-up-the-location) section.  

    Next, notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    The delivery of loudspeakers from vendor 10000 has arrived at SILVER warehouse, and John proceeds to put them away.  

## Receive and put the items away  

Use the **Inventory Put-away** page to manage all inbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive and put the items away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Purchase Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the purchase from vendor 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the purchase order.  

5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 30 respectively on the two inventory put-away lines.  

6. Choose the **Post** action, select the **Receive** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 40 loudspeakers are now registered as put away in bin S-01-0001, and a positive item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted purchase receipt.

# Set up approval workflows

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Before you begin to use approval workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, then create the workflows.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values that represent scenarios supported by the application code.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

# Define document layouts for customers and vendors

Document layouts use report layouts to define the look and feel of documents that you send to customers and vendors. Business Central provides standard layouts, but you can also tailor custom layouts for each of your business partners. Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md). You select standard and custom document layouts from customer and vendor cards by choosing the **Document Layouts** action. The value in the **Usage** field defines the process for which the document layout is used. For example, for customers, you might use **Reminder**, **Shipment**, and **Confirmation** types of document layouts.

Document layouts can also save you time when you send documents to customer or vendor contacts by email. For each layout that you assign to the customer or contact, you can by specify one or more contact email addresses. For example, you can send an invoice to the customer's purchasing and warehouse contacts. Adding contact email addresses is easy. On the **Document Layouts** page, the **Select Email from Contacts** action let's you choose from a list of the contact email addresses that you registered for the customer or vendor. You can also add email addresses manually. If you enter multiple addresses, separate them with a semi-colon, and don't add spaces between the addresses.

Before you define which document layout to use for which processes, and which contact to send the document to, load all the available reports (documents) from the **Report Selections** page. You can quickly load the documents by using the **Copy from Report Selection** action on the **Document Layouts** page.

The steps in the following sections describe how to define sales document layouts from the **Customer Card** page. For vendors, the steps are the same from the **Vendor Card** page.

## Load the standard document layouts for sales documents for a customer

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then choose the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, choose the **Copy from Report Selection** action.

The **Document Layouts** page displays all layouts that are available for sales documents.

## Select a report layout to use for the sales document layout

The following steps assume that layout you want for the type of document is already created. Learn more about creating layouts in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then select the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for document layout that you want to use a report layout for, set the **Email Body Layout** and **Email Attachment Layout** fields. You can choose different layouts for each.

   >![!NOTE]
   > If you want to use a legacy custom report layout, set the layout in the **Custom Layout Description** field. By default, the **Custom Layout Description** field is hidden. If the field isn't available, you can personalize the page to add it. To personalize the page, select the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="The Settings icon."::: icon, and then select **Personalize**. Learn more about legacy custom report layouts in [(Legacy) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md)

## Specify which contact receives which document layout for a customer

To save time when you send documents to customer and vendor contacts by email, specify their email addresses on document layouts. For example, you can always send customer statements to their accountant contacts and sales orders to their purchasers, or purchase orders to vendor salespeople.

1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for a report layout that you want to send to a specific contact for the customer, select the **Select Email from Contacts** action.
1. On the **Contacts** page, select one or more contacts, and then select **OK**.

# Design Details: Rounding
Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

 When you use the average costing method, the rounding residual is calculated and recorded on a cumulative, entry-by-entry basis.  

 When you use a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual is calculated when the inventory increase has been fully applied, that is when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is equal to zero. A separate entry is then created for the rounding residual, and the posting date on this rounding entry is the posting date of the last invoiced value entry of the inventory increase.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how different rounding residuals are handled for the average costing method and non-Average costing method, respectively. In both cases, the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job has been run.  

 The following table shows the item ledger entries that the example is based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|4|  

 For an item using the Average costing method, the rounding residual (1/300) is calculated with the first decrease (entry number 2) and is carried forward to entry number 3. Therefore, entry number 3 is valued at –3.34.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.34|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  

 For an item using a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual (0.01) is calculated when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is zero. The rounding residual has a separate entry (number 5).  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.33|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  
|01-01-20|0|-0.01|1|5|

# Set Up Complex Application Areas Using Best Practices
Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software.  

 Whether you use Rapid Start to implement setup values or you manually enter them in the new company, you can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

 Help in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes best-practice information about how to set up key fields in the following application areas:

# Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides executives, purchasing managers, and procurement teams with valuable insights into purchasing activities. This app can help you streamline purchasing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize spending by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of purchasing data. Use its reports to increase transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in your daily operations.

## Purchases analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Procurement Officer

### Example scenario: preparing purchasing budgets

As the CEO of a manufacturing company, you need to stay on top of rising raw material costs to maintain profitability. For the leadership team, it's important to understand your organization's spending. The [Purchases Overview](purchases-powerbi-purchases-overview.md) and [Moving Annual Total](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md) reports can give you a better understanding of how much money you spend on purchasing activities and quickly spot increases in raw material costs.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the key metrics on the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png":::

You can also use the [Actual and Budget](purchases-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report to monitor the actual spending against the allocated budget. This comparison helps you make informed decisions to plan ahead for the coming months and years, giving you better budget control.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Actual vs. Budget matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png":::

## Purchases analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: reducing raw material costs

Purchase Managers in manufacturing ensure they have the materials they need to meet production demands. You notice an increase in the cost of a material, which could affect profitability. Using the [Purchases Decomposition](purchases-powerbi-purchases-decomposition.md) and [Purchases by Item](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-item.md) reports, you can quickly identify the vendor that provides the material and analyze the purchase amount compared to the previous year. This information can help you negotiate better prices with the vendor.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Amount by Item Category bar chart" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png":::

To monitor purchasing activities and ensure compliance with weekly or monthly budgets, the [Daily Purchases](purchases-powerbi-daily-purchases.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of purchase amounts. It aggregates amounts by day, week, month, and year. Use this report to spot unexpected spikes in spending and take corrective action before it affects your budget.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png":::

Also, you can use the [Moving Averages](purchases-powerbi-moving-averages.md) report to analyze purchasing trends and identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The **Purchases by Location** report can help you find discrepancies in purchasing patterns across different locations and make decisions.

## Purchases analytics for daily purchasing work

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Agent
- Purchasing Officer

### Example scenario: selecting vendors for purchasing raw materials

As a purchaser for a manufacturing company, you source materials for production. Part of your role is to keep purchasing costs under control to maintain profitability in the allocated budget. Use the **Purchases by Item** report to see the breakdown of purchases by item and category.

You notice that the company spent significantly on a particular category of materials. The purchase amount increased compared to the previous year. You decide to investigate by looking at the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report, which shows the breakdown of purchases by vendor.

You identify that one vendor consistently provided the materials at a higher price than other vendors. To analyze spending and manage your supplier relationship, use the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report. The report shows the purchasing activities for each vendor, including the amount spent, the number of transactions, and the vendors that supplied a specific category of material.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Vendor table" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png":::

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

# Project analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for project managers, such as:

- Cost performance for projects
- Completion rates for projects
- Financial data for projects

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's project data:

- Power BI reports for projects
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in project analytics tools
- Built-in project reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your projects.

## Analytics needs in projects

When you think about the analytics needs in projects management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in project management interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
|Project Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
|Project participant | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor project KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In project management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor project performance:

- % Complete
- % Invoiced
- Realization %
- Actual Profit
- Actual Profit Margin %
- Actual (Total Cost)
- Budget (Total Cost)

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Projects Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-overview.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for projects in the Project Power BI app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-projects-app](includes/power-bi-projects-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of project data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Project Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

# Viewing table information

The **8700 Table Information** page provides information about the number of records in all system and business tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and how much data each table contains.

This information is useful for troubleshooting performance problems because it shows the distribution of data sizes across tables.

## View table information

To open this page, select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Table Information**, and then choose the related link.

The following table describes the information provided for each table:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Company Name|The name of the company, if any, that the table belongs to.|
|Table Name|The name of the table.|
|Table No.|The ID of the table.|
|No. of Records|The total number of records stored in the table.|
|Record Size|The average record size in KB/record. The value is calculated using the following formula: 1024(Size)/(No. of Records). |
|Size (KB)|The total amount of space the table occupies in the database. This value is the sum of the values in the Data Size and Index Size fields.|
|Data Size (KB)|How much space the data in the base table occupies in the database.|
|Index Size (KB)|How much space the table indexes (keys) on the base table occupy in the database.|
|Compression|The type of compression, **Row**, **Page**, or **None** that is applied to the table in the database. To learn more, go to [Data compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression?).|

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete data in a table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starts several processes behind the scenes to make sure that everything is cleaned up in your database. The values on the Table Information page don't update until those processes are complete, which can take a while. The amount of time it takes can vary, depending on the size of your database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Table Information** page shows data and index (key) sizes for the base table. It doesn't include the sizes for *indexed views* used to maintain SIFT totals and it doesn't include the data and index sizes used by table extensions. Furthermore, the sum of table sizes doesn't match the total capacity used because it displays the data size, not the actual allocated size. Allocated space is always larger than used space to avoid having to allocate space on every insert, which would limit performance significantly.

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# Synchronizing data in Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can decide whether to synchronize data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of row, you can synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or vice versa. For more information, see [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronization uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronization rules
* Coupled records

When synchronization is set up you can couple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows to synchronize their data. You can start a synchronization manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides an overview of the ways you can synchronize.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  See  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronization|Synchronize on a row-by-row basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize individual records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] row, such as an account. This is typically how users will work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|[Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|

||Synchronize all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the records that have been modified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables since the last synchronization.|[Synchronizing All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronization of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are mapped, and create new records or rows in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronization synchronizes all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronization when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronization can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronization](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronization|Synchronize all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronization](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

> [!NOTE]
> The synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the scheduled execution of job queue entries and does not guarantee real time data consistency between two services. For real time data conistency you should explore [Business Central Virtual Tables](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-overview) or Business Central APIs.   

## Standard table mapping for synchronization

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

> [!TIP]
> You can reset configuration changes made to integration table and field mappings to their default settings by selecting the mappings, and then choosing **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Dataverse** actions will not be available on pages, for example, the Customer Card page, for records that do not respect the table filter on the integration table mapping.

### Tip for admins: viewing table mappings

You can view the mapping between the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables and the columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add additional mapping logic. For example, this can be useful if you need to troubleshoot synchronization.

## Use virtual tables to get more data

When you're setting up your integration, you can use virtual tables to make more data available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], without help from a developer.

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains objects that are also called virtual tables. Those table objects are not related to the virtual tables that you use with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about virtual tables, go to the following articles:

* [Create and edit virtual tables that contain data from an external data source](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities) (Power Apps documentation)
* [Business Central Virtual Table for Microsoft Dataverse Admin Reference](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-admin-reference) ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation)

To use virtual tables, you must install the **Business Central Virtual Entity** app from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/dynamics-365/microsoftdynsmb.businesscentral_virtualentity). 

After you install the app, you can enable virtual tables from one of the following pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* When you run the **Set up Dataverse connection** assisted setup guide, you can use the **Dataverse Available Virtual Tables** page to select multiple virtual tables. Afterward, the tables are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the PowerApps Maker Portal. 
* From the **Dataverse Connection Setup**, **Virtual Tables**, and **Available Virtual Tables** pages.  
* From the Power App Maker Portal.

## Synchronize data from multiple companies or environments

You can synchronize data from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies or environments with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. In multi-company synchronization scenarios, there are several things to consider.

### Set company IDs

When you synchronize records, we set a company ID on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity to clarify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company the records came from. Integration table mappings have integration table filter fields that take the company ID into account. To include a table mapping in a multi-company setup, on the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox. The setting optimizes how integration table filter fields filter company IDs in a multi-company setup.

For integration table mappings that synchronize documents, such as orders, quotes, and opportunities, if you choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox the integration only considers entities that have the company ID of the current [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. To synchronize documents, for example, between Business Central and Sales, users in Sales must specify the company ID on the documents. Otherwise, the documents won't synchronize.  

For all other integration table mappings, choosing the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox removes the filter on company ID. The synchronization will consider related entities, regardless of their company ID.

### Specify the synchronization direction

If you enable multi-company support on an integration table mapping, we recommend that you set the direction of the mapping to **FromIntegration**. If you set the direction to **ToIntegration** or **Bidirectional**, it's a good idea to use **Table Filter** and **Integration Table Filter** to control which entities synchronize with which company. It's also a good idea to use match-based coupling to avoid creating duplicate records. To learn more about match-based coupling, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#customize-the-match-based-coupling).

### Use unique numbers

If your number series doesn't guarantee that primary key values are unique to each company, we recommend that you use prefixes. To start using prefixes, create a transformation rule on the integration field mapping. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Handle differences in field values](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#handle-differences-in-field-values).

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Managing Database Access Intent

As a super user or administrator, you can change the database access intent on reports, pages of the type API, and queries to improve performance of the service.

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set up to use read-only replicas of the primary (read-write) database. Using the database replica reduces the load on the primary database. In some cases, it will also improve the performance when viewing data in the client. Replicas are beneficial for objects, like reports, queries, and API pages, that are used for viewing data only, not modifying data.

When objects run, the database access intent determines whether to use a read-only replica, if one is available, or the primary database. Reports, API pages, and queries are developed with a predefined database access intent (see [DatabaseAccessIntent property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataaccessintent-property)).

The **Database Access Intent List** page lets you override the predefined database access intent for objects when they're run.

In database terms, this feature is commonly known as *read scale-out*. For more information about read-scale out and data access intent in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Utilizing Read Scale-Out for Better Performance](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and Administration help.

## To change the database access intent

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Database Access Intent List**, and then choose the related link.

    The page lists all reports, pages, and queries. The **Access Intent** column includes one of the following values:

    |**Setting**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |**Default**|Indicates that the object uses the predefined database access intent.|
    |**Allow Write**|Sets the object to use the primary database, allowing the user to modify data.|
    |**Read Only**|Sets the object to use the database replica, which means that the user can only view data, not change data.|

2. Choose the **Edit List** action.

3. On the **Edit - Database Access Intent List** page, change the **Access Intent** field for the objects.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an object that is editable, like the Customer Card, is set to **Read Only**, the primary database will still be used, regardless of the access intent, allowing users to make changes as normal.

title: Design Details - Availability in the Warehouse
description: Learn about the different factors that affect item availability in your warehouse.

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:  

quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.

# Set up posting groups

Posting groups map entities to general ledger accounts. Examples of entities are customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents. Posting groups save time and help avoid mistakes when you post transactions. The transaction values go to the accounts specified in the posting group for that particular entity. The only requirement is that you have a chart of accounts. For more information, see [Set Up the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

Posting groups are covered under three umbrellas:  

* General

  Define who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy. You can also combine groups to specify things like the income statement accounts to post to, or use groups to filter reports.  
* Specific

  Use sales documents, for example, instead of posting directly to the general ledger. When you create entries in the customer ledger, corresponding entries are made in the general ledger.  
* Tax

  Define the tax percentages and calculation types that apply to who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy.

The following sections describe the posting groups under each umbrella.  

## General posting groups

The following table describes the general posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General Business Posting Groups |Assign this group to customers and vendors to specify who you sell to, and who you buy from. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need to break down sales and purchases. For example, group customers and vendors by geographical area, or by the type of business. |
| General Product Posting Groups |Assign this group to items and resources to specify what you sell, and what you buy. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Product Posting Groups** page. When you do, consider the number of groups you need to break down sales by product (items and resources) and purchases by items. For example, divide these groups by raw materials, retail, resources, capacity, and so on. |
| General Posting Setups |Combine business and product posting groups and choose the accounts to post to. For each combination of business and product posting groups, you can assign a set of general ledger accounts. For example, you can post the sale of the same item to different general ledger accounts because customers are assigned to different business posting groups. Set these configurations up on the **General Posting Setup** page. |

## Specific posting groups

The following table describes the posting groups that are specific to types of data.

|Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Posting Groups |Define the accounts to use when you post accounts receivable transactions. If you use inventory with receivables, the accounts that the sales order lines post to are determined by the general business posting group assigned to your customer, and the general product posting group assigned to the inventory item. See *General Business Posting Groups* and *General Product Posting Groups* in the [General posting groups](#general-posting-groups) section. Set up these posting groups on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. |
| Vendor Posting Groups |Define where to post transactions for payables accounts, service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts. This is similar to customer posting groups. Set up these posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page. |
| Inventory Posting Groups |Define inventory posting groups that you then assign to the relevant item accounts on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page. This way, when you post entries concerning an item, the system posts to the G/L account that is set up for the combination of inventory posting group and location that is linked to the item. Inventory posting groups also provide a good way to organize your inventory, so you can separate items by their posting group when you generate reports. Set up these posting groups on the **Inventory Posting Groups** page. |
| Bank Account Posting Groups |Define the general ledger accounts that bank account entries are posted to. For example, this can simplify the processes of tracing transactions and reconciling bank accounts. Set up these posting groups on the **Bank Account Posting Groups** page. We recommend that these G/L accounts have the **Direct Posting** field set to *No*. |
| Fixed Assets Posting Groups |Define accounts for different types of expenses and costs, such as acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation amounts, acquisition costs on disposal, accumulated depreciation on disposal, gains on disposal, losses on disposal, maintenance expenses, and depreciation expenses. Set up these posting groups on the **FA Posting Groups** page. |

### Allow substitute customer or vendor posting groups on documents

You can let people choose other customer and vendor posting groups than the default groups when they're working with sales or purchase documents and journals.

To allow changes to customer posting groups, choose **Allow Multiple Posting Groups** on the **Sales & Receivable Setup** and **Service Mgt. Setup** pages, and the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page for vendor posting group changes.

On the **Customer Posting Groups** or **Vendor Posting Groups** pages, you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing **Substitutions**. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting groups specified for a customer or vendor.

After you set this up, you can choose from the allowed substitute posting groups and change the customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. The substitute customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals, and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.

When applying, for example, an invoice and payment that are posted with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.

## Tax posting groups

The following table describes the tax-related posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax Business Posting Groups |Determine how to calculate and post sales tax for customers and vendors. Set up these posting groups on the **Tax Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need. For example, it might depend on factors like local legislation, and whether you trade both domestically and internationally. |
| Tax Product Posting Groups |Indicate the tax calculations needed for the types of items or resources you buy or sell. |
| Tax Posting Setup |Combine tax business posting groups and tax product posting groups. When you fill in a general journal line, purchase line, or sales line, we look at the combination to identify the accounts to use. |

If your country/region uses value-added tax (VAT), see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).  

## Example of linking posting groups

Here's a scenario.  

These posting groups are chosen on the customer card:  

* General business posting group
* Customer posting group  

These posting groups are chosen on the item card:  

* General product posting group  
* Inventory posting group  

When you create a sales document, the sales header uses the customer card information, and the sales lines use the item card information.  

* The revenue posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group.  
* The accounts receivable posting (balance sheet) is determined by the customer posting group.  
* The inventory posting (balance sheet) is determined by the inventory posting group.  
* The cost of goods sold posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group.  

Your setup determines when posting happens. For example, the timing is affected by when you do periodic activities, such as posting inventory cost or adjusting cost item entries.

## Copy posting setup lines

The more product and business posting groups you have, the more lines you'll have on the **General Posting Setup** page. While there might be many different combinations of business and product posting groups, different combinations might still post to the same general ledger accounts. To limit the amount of manual entry, copy the general ledger accounts from an existing line on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up posting groups on the go

To get users started faster, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can show notifications of missing G/L accounts in various posting group setups. To get these notifications, make sure that the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification is selected in the **My Notifications** page, which you can access from the **Change when I receive notifications** field in the **My Settings** page.  

This way, when you work on a document that uses a posting group or a setup that is missing a required general ledger account, you get a notification. Choose the link in the notification to open a page where you can make the relevant changes, provided you have permission to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> In order to take you directly to the posting group or setup that is missing a general ledger account, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a placeholder posting group or setup. Posting groups and setups are a way for the accountant to control how entries are posted to the general ledger, so such the just-in-time creation of posting groups and setups might not be allowed in your organization.  
>
> In that case, disable the *G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup* notification, and then work with your accountant to make the relevant changes to the posting group, setup, or your document. This is an important step, because after documents are posted, you can't delete incorrectly used posting groups or setups because general ledger entries are created for them.

Use the **Blocked** field in the **General Posting Setup** page to prevent users from mistakenly using a setup that is no longer relevant for new postings. 

## Access all fields and accounts when you set up a posting group  

Posting groups can be complex to set up. Because some types of accounts aren't frequently used, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't show them as columns on the lines. Also, to make it a bit easier to choose the right accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the accounts that you can choose in field lookups. 

If you want to access all accounts on the lines and in the field lookups, there are a couple of settings that can help:

* To show all accounts as columns on the lines, turn on the **Show All Accounts** toggle.
* On individual lines, to access all accounts in the field lookups, choose the **View All Accounts on Lookup** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show All Accounts** toggle might not seem to work on the **General Posting Setup** page. That's because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always shows all accounts as columns on the lines on that page.

## Troubleshooting posting group errors

Posting groups are one of the more advanced concepts to set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they aren't set up correctly, errors can occur when posting documents or journal lines. For example, these errors are typically caused by a mistake in how general ledger accounts are assigned, or how posting groups are combined.

When something is wrong, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the **Error Messages** page. The **Error Messages** page can make it easier to identify and resolve the issue. The page offers a description of the error that points out the posting group setup that needs attention. For example, the message might read "Sales Prepayment account is missing a General Posting Setup." There's also a link to open the page that's the source of the issue, so you can quickly resolve it.  

> [!NOTE]
> The error handling described above is not available on item, resource, employee, and fixed asset journals, or for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.

## Audit changes to posting groups

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your posting group setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for posting group and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| Gen. Product Posting Group | 251 |
| Customer Posting Group | 92 |
| Inventory Posting Group | 94 |
| FA Posting Group | 5606 |
| Vendor Posting Group | 93 |

# EBITDA (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **EBITDA** report provides an overview of your company's performance from the perspective of both earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). You can review EBIT and EBITDA over time to identify trends in operational performance and inform decisions about cost management and pricing strategies.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/ebitda-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the EBITDA report" lightbox="media/finance/ebitda-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to evaluate cash flow potential before making strategic decisions. By analyzing EBIT, you can gauge the efficiency with which your core business generates profits from operations. EBITDA excludes both nonoperational costs and noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization. Use EBITDA when you compare your business to your peers in the industry.

EBITDA is good for comparing cash flow potential across similar businesses. EBIT offers a fuller picture of profit by including asset-related costs, which is essential for assessing long-term operational efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *EBITDA* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Operating Profit - EBIT**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#-change-in-operating-profit---ebit)
- [**EBITDA**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#ebitda)

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Responsible AI FAQ for autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central, and expert users that are tasked with entering records throughout their entire workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most-Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most-Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central similar to if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. 

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot due to the sensitive nature of that domain.

## What data does Autofill collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to offer the service. 

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your choice to keep or discard a suggestion. It doesn't collect suggested field values or other company data used by Copilot to provide suggestions.
- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers

You can assign serial numbers, lot numbers, and package numbers to any outbound or inbound document, and its posted item tracking entries display on the related item ledger entries. You track items on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, which you can open from inbound or outbound documents.

The quantity fields at the top of the **Item Tracking Lines** page display the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are defined on the lines. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by *0* in the **Undefined** fields.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the availability information on the **Item Tracking Lines** page when you open the page. It doesn't update the information while you have the page open, even if changes occur in inventory or on other documents during that time.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order for the features described in this article to work, you must set up item tracking. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Tracking with Serial, Lot, and Package Numbers](inventory-how-setup-item-tracking.md).

## Item tracking availability

When you work with serial, lot, and package numbers, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates availability information and shows it on various item tracking pages. It shows how much of a lot, package, or serial number is used on other documents. This information helps reduce errors and uncertainty caused by double allocations.

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, a warning icon might display in the **Availability, Lot No.** or **Availability, Serial No.** field for the following reasons:

* If some or all of the quantity you've selected is already used in other documents.
* If the lot or serial number isn't available.

The **Lot No./Serial No.-List**, **Lot No./Serial No.-Availability**, and the **Item Tracking - Select Entries** pages show the quantity of an item that's in use. The following table lists the relevant fields.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total number of an item currently in inventory.|
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total number of items that are requested in this and other documents.|
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The number of items that are requested on the current document but that isn't posted.|
|**Current Requested Quantity**|The number of items that are requested that will be used on the current document|
|**Total Available Quantity**|The total number of items in inventory, minus the quantity of the item that's requested on this and other documents (total requested quantity), and minus the quantity that's requested but not yet posted on this document (current pending quantity).|

If you work on the **Item Tracking Lines** page for a long time, or if there's a lot of activities with the item you're working with, you can choose the **Refresh Availability** action. Also, the availability of the item is automatically rechecked when you close the page to confirm that there aren't availability problems.

## To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction

You might want to track items from the moment they arrive. In that case, the purchase order is often the central document. However, you can do item tracking from any inbound document and its posted entries display in the related item ledger entries.

The tracking numbers automatically transfer to all outbound warehouse activities.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Either open an existing purchase order or create a new purchase order.
3. Select the document line, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to open the **Edit - Item Tracking Lines** page.  

   You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways:  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** to assign serial/lot numbers from predefined number series.  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Create Customized SN** to assign serial/lot numbers based on number series you define specifically for the arrived items.  
   * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers directly, for example, the vendor's numbers.  
   * Manually, by assigning a specific number to each item unit.  

4. To assign automatically, choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
5. In the **Customized SN** field, enter the starting number of a descriptive serial number series. For example **S/N-Vend0001**.  
6. In the **Increment** field, enter 1 to define that each sequential number increases by one.  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can modify it.  

7. Select the **Create New Lot No.** checkbox to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a lot number with individual serial numbers according to the item quantity on the document line. The number is prefixed with the value you entered in the **Customized SN** field. For example, starting from **S/N-Vend0001**.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice

When you get posted receipt or shipment lines from related invoices or credit memos, item tracking lines on the warehouse documents transfer automatically. However, they're processed in a special way.

The functionality supports the following inbound processes:  

* **Get Receipt Lines** - from a purchase invoice.  
* **Get Return Shipment Lines** - from a purchase credit memo.  

The functionality supports the following outbound processes:  

* **Get Shipment Lines** - from a sales invoice or combined shipments.  
* **Get Return Receipt Lines** - from a sales credit memo.  

In these cases, the item tracking lines transfer to the invoice or credit memo, but the **Item Tracking Lines** page doesn't let you change the serial or lot numbers. You can only change the quantities.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase invoice for items that are purchase with serial or lot numbers.  
3. From a purchase invoice line, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. On the **Get Receipt Lines** page, select a receipt line that has item tracking lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The source document is copied to the purchase invoice as a new line, and its item tracking lines are copied to the underlying **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

5. On the purchase invoice, select the transferred receipt line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to find the transferred item tracking lines.  

You can't change the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields. However, you can delete complete lines or change the quantities to match changes on the source line.  

## To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction

Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes. There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions:  

* Select from existing serial or lot numbers. This applies when item tracking numbers are already assigned in an inbound transaction.
* Assign new serial or lot numbers for outbound transactions. This applies when item tracking numbers aren't assigned to items until they're sold and ready to ship.

### To select from existing serial or lot numbers  

When you work with items that require item tracking, and you're creating outbound transactions, you'll typically need to select lot or serial numbers that already exist.

1. From any outbound document, select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for.  
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then select **Item Tracking Lines**.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, you have three options for specifying lot or serial number:  

   * Select the **Serial No.** field, and then select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Lot No.** field, and then select a number on the **Lot No. List** page. Then, select the **Serial No.** field, and select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Process** action, and then choose **Select Entries**. The **Select Entries** page shows all lot and serial numbers along with availability information.

4. In the **Selected Quantity** field, enter the quantity of each lot or serial number to use.
5. Choose the **OK** button. The item tracking information transfers to the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document line, the item tracking information transfers to the associated item ledger entries.

### To assign new serial or lot numbers  

This process applies when items don't have serial or lot numbers while they're in inventory. Instead, you assign item tracking numbers when the items are sold and ready to be shipped. In this case, you'll typically assign numbers from a predefined number series.

1. Select the relevant document, for example a sales invoice or sales order, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  

    You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways:  
    * Automatically, from a predefined number series: Choose the **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** action.  
    * Automatically, based on parameters you define specifically for the outbound item: Choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
    * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers without using a number series.  

2. For this procedure, assign a serial number automatically by choosing **Assign Serial No.**  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can change it.  
3. Select the **Create New Lot No.** field to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
4. Choose the **OK** button to create a lot number and new individual serial numbers according to the quantity to handle on the related document line.  

The quantity fields at the top dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers that you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When the document is posted, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### Assign tracking numbers on source documents

Some companies define specific serial or lot numbers on source document, such as sales orders. For example, if a customer requests a specific lot. When you create the inventory pick or warehouse pick document from an outbound source document where serial or lot numbers are already defined, you can't change any fields on the **Item Tracking Lines** page under the inventory pick. The one exception is the **Qty. to Handle** field. In that case, the inventory pick lines specify the item tracking numbers on individual take and place lines. The quantity is already split into unique serial or lot number combinations because the sales order specifies the item tracking numbers to ship.

## To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders

Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that are being transferred between different locations are similar to those applied when items are sold and purchased.  

However, transfer orders are unique in that shipment and receipt are both done from the same transfer line and use the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. Item tracking numbers that shipped from one location must be received unchanged at the other location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the transfer order you want to process. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action, and then choose the **Shipment** action.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, assign or select serial or lot numbers as for any other outbound item transaction.  

    When you handle serial and lot numbers for transfer items, numbers are typically already assigned numbers. Therefore, you'll often choose from existing serial or lot numbers.  

4. Post the transfer order, first ship and then receive, to record that the items are transferred and carry their item tracking entries.  

During the transfer, you can't change values on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

## To record additional serial or lot number information

If you need to link special information to an item tracking number, for example, for quality assurance, you can do so on a serial or lot number information card.

1. Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned.
2. Open the **Item Tracking Lines** page for the item you want to enter information for.
3. Choose the **Line** action and then, for example, the **Serial No. Information Card** action.  
4. Choose the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list to create a new entry. The **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are prefilled from the item tracking line.
5. Enter a short piece of information in the **Description** field, for example about the condition of the item.  
6. Choose the **Related** action, choose the **Serial No.** action, and then choose the **Comment** action to create a separate comment record.  
7. Select the **Blocked** field to exclude the serial or lot number from any transactions.  

<!--If you create serial numbers in bulk by using the **Create Customized SN** or **Assign Serial No.** actions, you can enable **Create SN Information** and an information card will be created for each tracking line.

Alternatively, you can create an information card when you post journals or documents. On the **Item Tracking Code** page, turn on the **Create SN Info. on posting** or **Create SN Info. on posting** toggles. -->

You can modify created serial or lot information cards later.

## To modify existing serial or lot number information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information.
3. From the **Item Card** page, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Entries** action, and then choose **Ledger Entries**.
4. Choose the **Lot No.** or **Serial No.** field. If information exists for the item tracking number, then the **Lot No. Information List** or **Serial No. Information List** page opens.  
5. Select a card, and then choose the **Lot No./Serial No. Information Card** action.  
6. Modify the short description text, the comment record, or the **Blocked** field.  

You can't change the serial or lot numbers or quantities. To do that, you must reclassify the item ledger entry. To learn more about reclassification, go to [To reclassify lot or serial numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).

## To reclassify serial or lot numbers

Reclassifying item tracking for an item means changing a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number, or changing the expiration date to a new expiration date. If you use lots, you can also merge multiple lots into one. Use an item reclassification journal to do these tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that each line has a unique combination of serial, lot, and/or package numbers. If you want to split a lot, package, or a lot and package into several lots or packages, you must use multiple journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the line with the relevant information. For more information, see [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md) or [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).
3. Choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  
4. In the **Serial Nos.** or **Lot Nos.** field, select the current serial or lot number.  
5. If you want to enter a new item tracking number, enter it in the **New Serial No.** or **New Lot No.** field. If you want, you can merge one or more lots to one new or existing lot.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you reclassify expiration dates, items with the earliest expiration dates for outbound transactions are suggested first. To learn more, go to [Picking by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).

    > * If you're reclassifying a lot to the same lot number but with a different expiration date, you must reclassify the entire lot using one item reclassification journal line.
    > * If you're reclassifying more than one lot to one new lot number, meaning that you are merging more than one lot into one new lot, you must enter the same new expiration date for all the lots. 
    > * If you're reclassifying one existing lot to a second existing lot that has a different expiration date, you must use the expiration date from the second lot. 
    > * If you leave the **New Expiration Date** field blank, the lot or serial number will be reclassified with a blank expiration date.  

7. If you have existing information on the old serial or lot number, you can copy it to the new serial or lot number.  

    1. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, choose the **New Serial No. Information** action or the **New Lot No. Information** action.  
    2. To copy information from the old lot or serial number, choose the **Copy Info** action.  
    3. In the information list page, select the lot or serial number that you would like to copy from, and choose the **OK** button.  

8. If you want to modify the existing information for the lot or serial number, you can record lot or serial information.

# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

| Select these keys<br>(these keys in macOS) | To do this |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Show access keys for selecting actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu of the page. Learn more in the [Access keys for action bar and navigation menu](#access-keys-for-action-bar-and-navigation-menu) section. |

# Set Up Document Sending Profiles
You can set each customer up with a preferred method of sending sales documents, so that you do not have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action.

On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you set up different sending profiles that you can select from in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** check box to specify that the document sending profile is the default profile for all customers, except for customers where the **Document Sending Profile** field is filled with another sending profile.

When you choose the **Post and Send** action on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box shows the sending profile used, either the one set up for the customer or the default for all customers. In the dialog box, you can change the sending profile for the sales document. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

# Set Up Cash Customers

You cannot create an invoice without a customer number. This is true, even if you make a cash sale and do not have anything to record in a customer account.  

## To set up a cash customer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new **Customer** card. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
3. In the **No.** field, enter **Cash**, for example.  
4. In the **Name** field, enter **Cash Sale**, for example.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **Customer Posting Group** and the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields.  

 Now you have set up a customer that contains sufficient information for invoicing.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You may have chosen a posting group that is also used for domestic credit sales. If you want to maintain separate data on cash sales, for example, with a special sales or receivables account, you can set up an extra posting group for this purpose.  
>
> You must enter a number for a receivables account for the posting group, even though the balance in this account will always be 0 after you post an invoice.

# Responsible AI FAQ for Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Chat with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you're interested in general questions about using the feature, see [FAQ for chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot-faq.md).

## What is Chat with Copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you be more creative, productive, and efficient. You can chat with Copilot in Business Central to get answers and insights about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and your business data by typing what you want to know in natural language.

Chat with Copilot, also called chat, is an interactive feature that answers your questions without requiring you to navigate the user interface or the product documentation. The Copilot pane is available from anywhere in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.

You can ask questions in natural language, like "How do I deliver goods to my customers directly from my vendors?" or "Do we have any office chairs in stock for under $600?" In response, Copilot provides answers in natural language. Depending on the questions, answers can include plain text, links to records or pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and links to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] help articles on Microsoft Learn.

## What are the capabilities of Chat with Copilot?

You can chat with Copilot to get answers to the following classes of questions:

### Explain and guide

You can ask Copilot to explain a specific concept related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like what are dimensions, or provide guidance on how to complete a task, like how to post a sales order. Copilot searches the official [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation published by Microsoft, and provides an answer based on the documentation.

- Copilot uses the knowledge on Microsoft Learn (not a broad web search) to semantically search only Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation on Microsoft Learn. This includes product documentation, release plans, local functionality content, and troubleshooting content.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It simply summarizes any paragraphs it finds on Microsoft Learn that match the question or prompt in chat.

### Find business data and related pages

You can ask Copilot to locate pages by name or request records based on specific fields and constraints. If Copilot finds a match, it responds with a link to the relevant record or page, which you can then select to open. Chat with Copilot works closely with analysis assist to generate data analysis tabs directly from the Chat pane, helping you gain insights into your data. This approach is used whenever you ask questions best illustrated by grouped records or simple calculations, such as totals or averages.

- Copilot converts the natural language input into a query consisting of a table search, sort, and filter criteria.

  The capability uses [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s native data search capabilities to find matching data from tables within the companies database. The search runs under your own identity for security and compliance. It doesn't search outside of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It only summarizes the records received from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] native data search.

## What is the intended use of Chat with Copilot?

Chat is designed for enterprise use and answering questions that relate to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the business data it contains. The feature helps you solve common tasks such as finding records or getting guidance. You can express yourself in your own words, making your work easier and more accessible when working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was Chat with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing during which numerous English language texts covering a broad range of topics and styles of expressing intent were given to Copilot. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.
  
- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

You can provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. 

- You can provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
- We analyze and utilize your feedback on the feature to help us improve responses.
  
- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810).
  
- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of Chat with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the Chat with Copilot limitations when using the system?

- General limitations of AI

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. So, it's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses Copilot before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. For most responses, Copilot also includes citations or reference links that you can use to quickly verify whether Copilot gives a correct answer. For example, when asked how to perform some task, Copilot includes links to the source article. When asked to find a record based on specific criteria, Copilot includes links that describe the list page it identified as the topic of conversation. It also provides information about any filters or sorting that was applied to reach an answer.

- Language limitations

  - [!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

    If you chat with Copilot in a language other than English, Copilot might either respond in the same language, in English, or not at all. While in preview, chat is intended for use with the English language only.

  - The quality of answers can be lower under the following conditions:
    - The language of chat messages to Copilot is something other than en-US.
    - The language setting for the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] differs from the primary language of the data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Specific industry, product, and topic limitations

   Chat includes built-in safety mechanisms that prevent the undesirable generation of harmful content, such as sexually explicit content or incitement of violence. Sometimes, customers operate in industries, sell products and services, or work with processes that naturally overlap with what might be considered inappropriate in other contexts, or work with data that might trigger these safeguards. Chat might not perform as well in these cases.

## What data does Chat with Copilot collect and how is it used

Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational AI models for the benefit of others. Company administrators have full control to govern this data that is part of their Azure subscription. Because administrators or others in your company might have access to this data as determined by your employer, we recommend you don't enter sensitive data such as passwords or other secrets.

## What does Chat with Copilot offer for security

Chat is designed to be secure and executes under the user's identity, inheriting all security permissions and other restrictions and never operating outside of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s platform security. This design means that Copilot can only access data that you have access to.

For users with SUPER permission, chat can more easily locate unsecured data that's typically harder to get to for other users. Organizations that don't apply [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model to restrict which tables and objects each user or user role has access to, might be at elevated risk when using chat. Therefore, we recommend that your organization either implements [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model or deactivates chat.

# Subcontract manufacturing

Subcontracting selected operations to vendor is common in many manufacturing companies. Subcontracting can be a rare occurrence or can be an integral part of all production processes.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides several tools for managing subcontract work:  

- Work Centers with assigned vendor: This feature enables you to set up a work center that is associated with a vendor (subcontractor). This work center is called a subcontract work center. You can specify a subcontract work center on a routing operation, which allows you to easily process the subcontracted activity. In addition, the cost of the operation can be designated at the routing or the work center level.  
- Work Center cost based on units or time: This feature enables you to specify whether costs associated with the work center are based on the production time or a flat charge per unit. Although subcontractors commonly use a flat charge per unit to charge for their services, the application can handle both options (production time and flat charge per unit).  
- Subcontracting Worksheet: This feature allows you to find the production orders with material ready to send to a subcontractor and to automatically create purchase orders for subcontract operations from production order routings. The application automatically posts the purchase order charges to the production order during the posting of the purchase order. Only production orders with a status of released can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

## Subcontract work centers  

Subcontract Work Centers are set up the same as regular work centers with additional information. They're assigned to routings in the same manner as other work centers.  

### Subcontract work center fields  

This **Subcontractor No.** field designates the work center as a subcontract work center. You can enter the number of a subcontractor who supplies the work center. This field can be used to administer work centers, which aren't in-house but perform processing under contract.  

If you subcontract with the vendor for a different rate for each process, then select the **Specific Unit Cost** field. This setting lets you set up a cost on each routing line and saves the time of reentering each purchase order. The cost on the routing line is used in processing instead of the cost on the work center cost fields. Selecting the **Specific Unit Cost** field calculates costs for the vendor by the routing operation.  

If you subcontract at a single rate per vendor, leave the **Specific Unit Cost** field blank. The costs are set up by filling in **Direct Unit Cost**, **Indirect Cost %**, and **Overhead Rate** fields.  

### Routings that use subcontract work centers

Subcontract work centers can be used for operations on routings in the same way as regular work centers.  

You can set up a routing that uses an outside work center as a standard operational step. Alternatively, you can modify the routing for a particular production order to include an outside operation. This might be needed in an emergency such as a server not working correctly, or during a temporary period of higher demand where work you normally do in-house must be sent to a subcontractor.  

For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## Calculate subcontracting worksheets and create subcontract purchase orders  

After you calculate the subcontracting worksheet, the relevant document is created. In this case, a purchase order.  

The **Subcontracting Worksheet** page functions like the **Planning Worksheet** by calculating the needed supply, in this case purchase orders, which you review in the worksheet and then create with the **Carry Out Action Message** function.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only production orders with status **Released** can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

### To calculate the subcontracting worksheet  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To calculate the worksheet, choose the **Calculate Subcontracts** action.  
3. On the **Calculate Subcontracts** page, set filters for the subcontracted operations, or the work centers where they're performed, to calculate only the relevant production orders.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

    Review the lines on the **Subcontracting Worksheet** page. The information in this worksheet comes from the production order and production order routing lines and flows to the purchase order when that document is created. You can delete a row from the worksheet without affecting the original information, just as you can with the other worksheets. The information will reappear the next time you run the **Calculate Subcontracts** function.  

### To create the subcontract purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3. Select the **Print Orders** field to print the purchase order as it is created.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

If all subcontracted operations are sent to the same vendor location, then only one purchase order is created.  

The worksheet line that was turned into a purchase order is deleted from the worksheet. After a purchase order is created, it won't appear in the worksheet again.  

## Posting subcontract purchase orders  

After the Subcontractor Purchase Orders are created, they can be posted. Receiving the order posts a Capacity Ledger Entry to the production order and invoicing the order posts the direct cost of the purchase order to the production order.  

## To post a subcontract purchase order
 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase order that is created from the subcontracting worksheet.  

    On the purchase order lines, you see the same information that was in the worksheet. The **Prod. Order No.**, **Prod. Order Line No.**, **Operation No.**, and **Work Center No.** fields are filled in with the information from the source production order.  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

When the purchase is posted as received, an output journal entry is automatically posted for the production order if the subcontract operation is the last operation on the production order routing.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Posting output automatically for an ongoing production order when subcontracted items are received may not be desired. Reasons for this could be that the expected output quantity that is posted may be different from the actual quantity and that the posting date of the automatic output is misleading.  
>
> To avoid that the expected output of a production order is posted when subcontract purchases are received, make sure the subcontracted operation is not the last one. Alternatively, insert a new last operation for the final output quantity.  

When the purchase order is posted as invoiced, then the direct cost of the purchase order is posted to the production.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity posted via subcontract purchase orders. Don't be confused by the fact that posting a receipt might trigger posting of output. These transactions are separate and the expected cost of output is calculated independently.

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# View the availability of items

From the context of a business task, you can get advanced information about when and where an item is available, such as when talking to a customer about a delivery date.

You can view the availability of all items per location, and you can view the availability of each item by event or by period as well. An event is any scheduled item transaction, such as a sales shipment or an inbound transfer receipt.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Availability views by location require that you maintain inventory at more than one location. For more information, see [Set Up Locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md).

If you use warehousing functionality, availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with. A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows. For more information, see [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], availability figures are typically shown in two different fields, each with a different definition:

* The **Quantity on Hand** field, in some places named **Inventory**, shows the actual quantity today according to posted item ledger entries.
* The **Projected Available Balance** field is calculated and shows the quantity on hand plus scheduled receipts minus gross requirements. (In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], scheduled receipts include quantities on purchase orders and inbound transfer orders. Gross requirements include quantities on sales orders and outbound transfer orders.)

> [!TIP]  
>   The projected available balance is especially relevant to view in the **Item Availability by Periods** and **Item Availability by Event** pages because they contain the date dimension.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedures describe how to view advanced availability information from the items list and item card. You can also access the information from sales document lines for the item on the line. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To view the availability of an item according to when it will be received or shipped

You view the availability of an item according to scheduled item transactions on the **Availability by Event** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Event** action.

    The **Item Availability by Event** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time according to scheduled shipment and receipt events. The page gives a condensed view that shows one line of accumulated information per time interval in which inventory quantities change. Time intervals where no events occurred aren't shown. You can expand each line to show details about the event or events that caused the accumulated quantity on the line.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item in different periods

You view the availability of an item over time for specified time periods on the **Item Availability by Periods** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Period** action.

    The **Item Availability by Periods** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time, shown for a period that you select, such as Day, Week, or Quarter.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item at the locations where it's stored

You view the availability of an item at the different places where it's stored on the **Item Availability by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Location** action.

    The **Item Availability by Location** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop in the future, shown for each location where it's stored.
4. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.
5. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of all items by the location where they're stored

You view the availability of all your items across all your locations on the **Items by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Items by Location** action.

    The **Items by Location** page shows for all your items how many are available at each location.
3. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item by its use in assembly or production BOMs

If an item is part of assembly or production BOMs as either a parent item or a component, you can view how many units of it are required on the **Item Availability by BOM Level** page. The page shows how many units of a parent item you can make based on the availability of child items on underlying lines. Any item that has an assembly or production BOM is shown on the page as a collapsible line. You can expand this line to see the underlying components and lower-level subassemblies with their own BOMs.

For example, you can use the page to determine whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability and the quantities that can be supplied by its components. You can also use the page to identify bottlenecks in related BOMs.

On each line on the page for both parent items and child items, the following key fields specify the availability figures. You can use these figures to promise how many units of a parent you can supply if you start the related assembly process.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Able to Make Parent**|Shows how many units of any subassembly in the top item you can make. The field specifies how many immediate parent units you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|
|**Able to Make Top Item**|Shows how many units of the top item you can make. The field specifies how many units of the top-line BOM item you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|

### To view the availability of an item according to demand for its parent

The **Item Availability by BOM Level** page shows information for the item on the card or document line that the page is opened for. The item is always shown on the top line. You can view information for other items or for all items by changing the value in the **Item Filter** field.

> [!NOTE]  
>   By default, availability figures on the lines show the total availability of all items under the top item. These figures are displayed in the **Available Quantity** field, and the focus is on the top item. However, information about how many subassemblies you can make may be skewed. To get a true indication of how many of the shown subassemblies you can make, you must clear the **Show Total Availability** check box and then see the figure in the **Able to Make Parent** field.

The **Bottleneck** field specifies which item in the BOM structure restricts you from making a larger quantity than the quantity that is shown in the **Able to Make Top Item** field. For example, the bottleneck item can be a purchased component with an expected receipt date that is too late to make additional units of the top item by the date in the **Needed by Date** field.

## To view the availability of an item by its units of measure

The **Item Availability by Unit of Measure** page shows the availability of an item in the units of measure that it's stored in.

> [!NOTE]  
> To keep this information accurate, you must convert item units of measure. For example, if you purchase an item in one unit of measure, such as boxes, and you sell items in another unit of measure, such as pieces, you must use an item journal to convert the units of measure, or "unbox" items. You can use a negative adjustment item journal line to reduce inventory in the purchase unit of measure, for example boxes, and a positive adjustment to increase inventory in the sales unit of measure, for example pieces. 

## To view the availability of an item by its variants

The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows the actual and projected availability of an item grouped according to variant code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Variant** action.

    The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows availability for every variant that exists for the item. The page is empty if no variants exist for the item.

4. In the **View by** field, select the length of the time period that you want to view.
5. View the availability figures in the different quantity fields for each line.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Assembly availability page

The **Assembly Availability** page shows detailed availability information for the assembly item. It opens:

- Automatically from a sales order line in assemble-to-order scenarios when you enter a quantity that causes a component availability issue.
- Automatically from an assembly order header when you enter a value in the Quantity field that causes a component availability issue.
- Manually when you open it from an assembly order. On the Actions tab, in the Functions group, select Show Availability.

The **Details** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly item, including how many of the assembly order quantity can be assembled by the due date based on availability of the required components. This is shown in the Able to Assemble field on the Details FastTab.

The value in the **Able to Assemble** field is shown in red font if the quantity is lower than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field, indicating that there aren't enough components available to assemble the full quantity.

The **Lines** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly components.

If one or more assembly components aren't available, then this is reflected in the **Able to Assemble** field on the line in question as a quantity less than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the **Details** FastTab.

# Managing inventory costs
Cost management, also referred to as 'costing,' is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.   


The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|
|Specify a default costing method for the company to govern how incoming cost is used to assess inventory value and the cost of goods sold.|[Set Up General Inventory Information](inventory-how-setup-general.md)|  
|Specify a costing method on individual items if they require a different costing method.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|  
|Define inventory periods to control inventory value over time by disallowing transaction posting in closed inventory periods.|[Work with Inventory Periods](finance-how-to-work-with-inventory-periods.md)|  
|Ensure that sales returns are applied to the original outbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page|  
|Ensure that purchase returns are applied to the original inbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Purchases & Payables** page|
|Set up the rounding rules to apply when adjusting or suggesting item prices and when adjusting or suggesting standard costs.|**Rounding Method** page|  

Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Ensure that you know the cost of shipped items by assigning added item costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur after selling.|[Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md)|
|Appreciate or depreciate the value of one or more items in inventory by posting their current, calculated value.|[Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md)|
|View and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.|[Remove and Reapply Item Ledger Entries](finance-how-to-remove-and-reapply-item-entries.md)|
|Adjust item costs, either automatically or manually, to forward cost changes from inbound entries to their related outbound entries.|[Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md)|
|Perform period-end control and reporting tasks, such as calculate the value of inventory and post costs to the general ledger.|[Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md)|
|Learn how you can use the job queue to move the tasks for adjusting inventory cost or reconciling it with the general ledger to the background.|[Adjust and Reconcile Inventory Cost with General Ledger with Job Queue](finance-adjust-reconcile-inventory-cost-job-queue.md)|
|Use the **Applies-from Entry** field in the item journal to manually create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction.|[Close Open Item Ledger Entries Resulting from Fixed Application in the Item Journal](finance-how-to-close-open-item-ledger-entries-resulting-from-fixed-application-in-the-item-journal.md)|  

Use special costing functions for every-day item transactions in the item operations.

# Pick Items with Inventory Picks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post picking and shipping information for your source documents. Outbound source documents can be sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly order component needs also represent outbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly orders for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).
>
> Although service orders are also outbound source documents, they don't support the basic, order-by-order level of complexity.
>
> When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, there are rules you must follow when you create inventory pick lines. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

You can create an inventory pick in in three ways:

* Create the inventory pick directly from the source document.  
* Create inventory picks for multiple source documents at the same time by using a batch job.
* Request the pick in two steps by first releasing the source document, which acts as a signal to the warehouse that the source document is ready picking.

The inventory pick can then be created from the **Inventory Pick** page based on the source document.  

## To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a sales order, purchase return order, or outbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.  
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory pick will be created.

## To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create picks only for sales orders.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create the pick in two steps

### To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document

For sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders, you create the warehouse request by releasing the order. Releasing the order makes the items available for picking.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.

### To create an inventory pick based on the source document

After you release an order, the warehouse employee can create an inventory pick.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of document you're picking for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to create a list of all outbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick lines according to the selected source documents.  

## To record inventory picks

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin that the items must be picked from is suggesting per the item's default bin. You can change the bin in this page if necessary.  
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the quantity that in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the shipment of the source document lines that were picked.
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks

You can also use the **Inventory Pick** page to pick and ship for sales where items must be assembled before they can be shipped. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

Assemble-to-order items aren't physically in a bin until they're assembled and posted as output to a bin. Picking assemble-to-order items from a bin for shipments follows a special flow.

1. From a bin, warehouse workers take the assembly items to the shipping dock and then post the inventory pick.
2. The posted inventory pick posts the assembly output, the component consumption, and the sales shipment.

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically create an inventory movement when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** field on the **Assembly Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md).

Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways, depending on whether none, some, or all of the sales line quantities are assembled to order. In scenarios where some of the quantity is assembled and some is picked from inventory, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

For sales where the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order, one inventory pick line is created for the quantity. The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is the same as the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The **Assemble to Order** field is selected on the line.

If an assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line contains the value from the following fields, in the following order.

* ***Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** <!-- not applicable for inv pick-->
* **From-Assembly Bin Code**

If a bin code isn't specified on the sales order line, and no assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line is empty. The warehouse worker must open the **Bin Contents** page and select the bin where the assembly items are assembled.

In scenarios where a part of the quantity is assembled and another must be picked, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

* One pick line for the assemble-to-order quantity. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following fields, in this order, to determine the bin code: **Bin Code**, **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code**, and then **From-Assembly Bin Code**. If these fields are blank, the warehouse employee must open the **Bin Contents** page and choose the bin where the items are assembled.  
* The other pick line depends on which bins can fulfill the remaining quantity. If the item is kept in multiple bins, multiple lines will be created. The Take line is based on the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> If items are assembled to order, the inventory pick for the linked sales order till create an inventory movement for all of the assembly components.

# Inventory analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for inventory managers:

- Shipping of goods when sales orders are fulfilled.
- Receipts of items when purchase orders are fulfilled.
- Movements of items between locations.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's inventory data:

- Power BI reports for inventory
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in inventory analytics tools
- Built-in inventory reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your inventory.

## Analytics needs in inventory

When you think about the analytics needs in inventory management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports           |
|Inventory Manager  | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Warehouse worker   | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their core inventory performance:

- Number of Scheduled Receipt
- Number of Planned Order Receipt
- Gross Requirement
- Projected Available Balance
- Quantity on Sales Orders, Purchase Returns, Service Orders, Projects, Production Orders, or Assemply Component
- Inventory by Item/Location/Lot/Serial No.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png":::

For inventory valuation, you can use the following KPIs to monitor the value kept in your inventory:

- Ending balance inventory value
- Variance by item/location
- Invoiced Quantity
- Increases/Decreases in quantity (by item/location)

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Valuation by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-Location.png":::

All of these purchasing KPIs (and more) are available in the Inventory Power BI apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to:

- [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md)
- [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md)

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-valuation-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-valuation-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md).

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to inventory

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for inventory management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track inventory postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to inventory)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for inventory management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your inventory accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png" alt-text="Example of how to do a old stock data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png"::: -->

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on inventory data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-inventory.md).

## Built-in reports for inventory

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help inventory organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_reports_report_explorer](includes/inventory-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for inventory, go to [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md).

## On-screen inventory analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you inventory overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md)
- [Trace item-tracked items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md)
- [Audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md#to-audit-the-reconciliation-between-the-inventory-ledger-and-the-general-ledger)
- [View cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md#to-view-cross-docked-items-in-a-shipment-or-pick-worksheet)

The sales module also include analytics pages related to inventory:

- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)

### Show inventory-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for inventory management, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post inventory entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze inventory data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Analyzing financial statements in Microsoft Excel (obsolete)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is deprecated and will be removed in a later [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] release. Learn more in [Deprecated features in the base app](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). Learn more about alternative finance reporting in [Financial analytics overview](bi.md).

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides KPIs and get overviews of your company's finances. The following are examples of ways to analyze KPIs and overviews in Excel:

* Open lists in Excel and analyze the data.
* Export heavy financial statements such as your balance sheet or income statement to Excel, analyze the data, and print the reports.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, the reports you can view in Excel are designed to help you analyze the current year. The Income Statement report is an exception, however. That report lets you filter the data to include previous years in your analyses.

## Get the overview and the details in Excel

In the Business Manager and Accountant Role Centers, the **Reports** action lets you choose the financial statements to view in Excel. When you choose a statement, it will be opened in Excel or Excel Online. An add-in connects the data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, you have to sign in with the same account that you use with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following table lists the reports and where they're available.  

|Report  |Role Center  |
|---------|---------|
|Balance Sheet                 | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Income Statement              | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Cash Flows       | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Retained Earnings| Business Manager, Accountant |
|Sales Taxes Collected         | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Customer Statements           | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Payable         | Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Receivable      | Accountant |

Let's say you want to dig deeper into your cash flow. From the Business Manager or Accountant Role Center, you can open the **Statement of Cash Flows** report in Excel, but what actually happens is that we export the relevant data for you and create an Excel workbook based on a predefined template. Depending on your browser, you might be prompted to open or save the workbook.  

In Excel, you see a tab where the data is laid out for you on the first worksheet. All the data that was exported is also present in other worksheets in case you need it. You can print the report right away, or you can modify it until you have the overview and the details that you want. Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel Add-in to further filter and analyze data.  

### Understand the Excel templates

The predefined Excel reports are based on the data in the current company. For example, the demonstration company has set up the chart of accounts to list three cash accounts under *Current Assets*: 10100 **Checking account**, 10200 **Saving account**, and 10300 **Petty Cash**. The accounts have the **Account Subcategory** field set to *Cash*, and it's their combined amount that shows up as *Cash* in the **Balance Sheet** Excel report.  

Other sheets in the Excel workbook show the data behind the report. To find out what's behind the groupings in the Excel reports, you might have to filter the lists in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel add-in

Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel. Depending on your subscription, you're signed in automatically, or you must provide your sign-in details for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

The add-in lets you get fresh data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can push changes back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, the ability to push data back to the database is not available for the financial reports you can view in Excel.

# Walkthrough: Calculating work in process for a project

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

For projects, you can schedule the use of company resources and track their associated costs. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you should track as a project progresses. If a project runs over a long period, you might want to transfer its costs to a Work in Process (WIP) account on the balance sheet. You can then recognize the costs and sales in your income statement accounts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Calculate WIP.  
- Select a WIP calculation method.  
- Exclude part of a project from the WIP.  
- Post the WIP to the general ledger.  
- Reverse a WIP posting.  

Each step of the process calculates the value and moves the project transactions to the general ledger. The calculation and posting steps are separated to help you review your data and to make modifications before posting to the general ledger. Therefore, you should make sure that all information is correct after you run the calculation batch jobs and before you run the posting batch jobs.  

## Roles

This walkthrough uses the project team member (Tricia) as the persona.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS International Ltd., a design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures, such as conference halls and offices, with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of the work at CRONUS is project-oriented and Tricia, a project team member, uses project to have an overview of ongoing and completed projects. Some projects can be lengthy and take months to complete. Tricia can use a WIP account to record the work in process and track the costs throughout the project.  

## Calculating WIP

CRONUS has taken on a lengthy project that has now extended across reporting periods. Tricia calculates the work in process (WIP) to make sure that the financial statement is accurate.  

During this procedure, Tricia selects a specific group of tasks to include in the WIP calculation. On the **Project Task Lines** page, Tricia specifies the lines in the **WIP-Total** column.  

The following table describes the options.  

|Field|Description|  
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**\<blank\>**|Leave blank if the project task is a part of a group of tasks.|  
|**Total**|Defines the range or group of tasks that are included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, the WIP total includes any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting**, unless its **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**.|  
|**Excluded**|Applies only to a task with a **Project Task Type** of **Posting**. The task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated.|  

In the following walkthrough, Tricia applies the Cost Value method, which is their company standard, to calculate WIP. Tricia specifies the part of the project to include in the WIP calculation by assigning WIP-Total values to various project task lines.  

### To calculate WIP  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Edit** action. This opens the Project Card in edit mode.  

     WIP can be calculated based on Cost Value, Sales Value, Cost of Sales, Percentage of Completion, or Completed Contract. In this example, CRONUS uses the Cost Value method.  

3. On the **Posting** FastTab, choose the **WIP Method** field, and then select **Cost Value**.  
4. Choose the **Project Task Lines** action and set the following values in the **WIP-Total** field.  

   |Project Task No.|WIP-Total Field|  
   |------------------|----------------------|  
   |1130|Excluded|  
   |1190|Total|  
   |1210|Excluded|  
   |1310|Excluded|  

5. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Calculate WIP** action.  
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, select a project to calculate WIP for. On the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
7. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a date that's later than the work date.
8. In the **Document No.** field, enter **1**. You can use this number later for traceability.  
9. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job. A message is displayed. Choose the **OK** button to continue. Close the **Project Task Lines** page.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The message states that there are warnings associated with the WIP calculation. You'll review the warnings in the next procedure.  

10. On the **Project Card** page, expand the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab to see the calculated values. You can also see the **WIP Posting Date** and the values posted to the general ledger, if any.  

   Notice that the value for **Recog. Costs Amount** is 215.60 in the **To Post** column. This reflects the total costs of two of the items in the group of project tasks 1110 – 1130. The third item was set to **Excluded**, and therefore isn't included in the WIP calculation.  

### To review WIP warnings  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Show Warnings** action.  
3. On the **Project WIP Warnings** page, review the warning associated with the project.  

   After the accounting period ends, Tricia must recalculate WIP to include the work completed to this point.  

### To recalculate WIP  

1. On the **Project Card** page, choose the **WIP Entries** action to view the WIP calculation.  

     The **Project WIP Entries** page shows the WIP entries that were last calculated on a project, even if WIP hasn't yet been posted to the general ledger.  

2. You can follow the steps in the procedure that explains how to calculate WIP to recalculate WIP. Every time WIP is calculated, an entry is created on the **Project WIP Entries** page.  
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> WIP and recognition are calculated but aren't posted to the general ledger. To post, use the **Post WIP to G/L** action after you calculate the WIP and recognition.

## Posting WIP to general ledger

Now that Tricia has calculated WIP for this project, they can post it to the general ledger.  

### To post WIP to general ledger  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, on the **Projects** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to post WIP to the general ledger.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

   After you complete the posting, you can view the posting information on the **WIP G/L Entries** page.  

7. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action.  

   On the **Project WIP G/L Entries** page, verify that the WIP posted to the general ledger.  

8. Close the page.  
9. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
10. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, notice that in the **Posted** column, the **Recog. Costs G/L Amount** field is filled in, which indicates that WIP was posted to the general ledger successfully.  
11. Choose the **OK** button to close the card.  

## Reversing a WIP posting

Tricia determines that the project tasks that were excluded from the calculation of WIP should have been included. Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings without having to post new WIP postings.  

### To reverse a WIP posting  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post to WIP to G/L** page, on the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Reversal Posting Date** field, enter the original posting date. It should be the same date that you used to calculate WIP the first time.  
6. Select the **Reverse Only** checkbox. This reverses the previously posted WIP, and posts new WIP to the general ledger.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job, and choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
8. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
9. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, verify that there aren't any posted WIP entries.  
10. Close this page.  
11. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action. The WIP entries have the **Reversed** checkbox selected.  
12. Close this page.  
13. Open **Project Task Lines** for the project, include the parts of the project that should be in the WIP calculation, and then recalculate and post the new value to the general ledger.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Suppose Tricia calculated and posted WIP for a project with incorrect dates. Following the method that was discussed earlier, Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings, correct the dates, and post to the general ledger.

# Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers an add-in that lets you manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in for Outlook, you can see financial data related to customers and vendors, and create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in consists of two separate add-ins that provide the following capabilities:

- Contact insights

   This add-in lets you look up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also lets you create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such a sales quote or invoice to a contact.

- Document view

   When a business document is sent in an email, the add-in provides a direct link from email to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Get started

1. The first thing to do is get the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in installed in Outlook. Your administrator may have already installed the add-in for you. So if you're not sure, check with your administrator or see the next step to verify whether it's installed.

    If the add-in hasn't been installed for you, see [Install the add-in for your own use](admin-outlook.md#install). 

2. With the add-in installed, you can access the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in from any new or existing email message or calendar appointment in Outlook.

    Start by signing in to Outlook and opening an email message. Then, if you're using the Outlook app, go to the ribbon, and look for **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.  Or if you're using Outlook on the web, at the top the email message, select **Apps** ![Shows the apps button in Outlook.](media/apps-icon.png) > **Business Central** ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) or go to the more actions ![Show more actions for an email in Outlook.](media/outlook-more-actions-button.png) button.

    ![Access Business Central add-ins in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-addin.png)

   If you've installed the add-in on your own and chose to get a sample email, check your inbox for the welcome email. This email provides information to help you get started.

The first time you use the add-in, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in pane, you might be asked to sign in. In this case, choose **Sign in now** and follow the instructions onscreen to sign in to Business Central using your account.

> [!TIP]
> If you use the new Outlook on the web, you can pin **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** so that it is always immediately visible, instead of having to go to the more actions button, making it convenient to view contact insights while you browse through different emails.

For more information, see [Use add-ins in Outlook on the web](https://support.office.com/article/using-add-ins-in-outlook-on-the-web-8f2ce816-5df4-44a5-958c-f7f9d6dabdce?ns=OLWAO365B&version=16).  

## Work with contacts and documents using the Contact Insights add-in

Let's say that you get an email from a customer that wants to get a quote on some items. Directly in Outlook, you open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in, which recognizes the sender as a customer, and opens the customer card for that company. From this dashboard, you see overview information for the customer, and drill down for more detail on specific documents. You can also dig into the sales history for the customer. If it's a new contact, you can create them as a new customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] without leaving Outlook.  

In the add-in, you can create a sales quote and send it back to this customer without leaving Outlook. All of the information that you need to send the sales quote is available in your business inbox in Outlook. Once you have the data entered, you post the quote and send it by email. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates a .PDF file with the sales quote and attaches it to the email message that you draft in the add-in.  

Similarly, if you get an email from a vendor, you can use the add-in to work with vendors and purchase invoices.  

Sometimes you want to see more fields than you can see in the add-in, such as when you want to fill in lines in an invoice. To give you a bit more space to work with, you can pop out the add-in to a separate page. It's still part of Outlook, but you have more space. As you enter data for the document in the pop-out view, the changes are automatically saved. 
The following sections lead you through some basic tasks to give you a general understanding how to use it.

> [!TIP]
> The tasks explain how to use the add-in from an email message. But you can do the same from a calendar appointment in Outlook.

### Look up a business contact when composing an email

1. Create a new email message.
2. In the ribbon, go to **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** and choose **Contact Insights**. Or if you're using Outlook on the web, at the top of the message, select **Apps** ![Shows the apps button in Outlook.](media/apps-icon.png) > **Business Central** ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) > **Contact Insights**.
3. In the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in pane that opens, scan for and choose the contact you want.

    An overview of the contact displays in the pane and the contact is added in the **To** line of the email.

### View and change the contact details or switch company

The action bar at the top of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in pane includes several actions that let your dig deeper into details about the contact and change things.

![Business Central add-in action bar in Outlook.](media/outlook-addin-action-bar.png)

For example, you can open the full contact details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you work with more that one [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, you can easily switch between companies.

### Track incoming documents

Perhaps you use the **Incoming Documents** list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to track documents for processing that vendors send to you, such as a purchase invoice that needs to be paid. If you do, you can easily create Incoming Documents records from the Outlook add-in and include the email attachments.

1. When you receive an email from a vendor that has an attachment, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**  > **Contact Insights**.  

2. In the action bar of the add-in, choose **Show more actions**, then choose the **Send to Incoming Documents…** action.  

### Create and send new document to a contact

1. In the ribbon or at the bottom of the email message, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** > **New**, then choose the type of document you want to create, such as **Sales Quote**.
2. Make changes to the document in the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in pane.
3. When the document is ready to send to the contact, in the action bar, choose **Show more actions**, then choose the **Send by Email** action.

### Attach files to records

Your email inbox often serves as a source of incoming files that initiate or unblock workflows. Files can include things like PDF invoice payments, photos of goods, or requirements in a Word document. When working in Outlook with Business Central records like vendors, customers, purchase invoices, or sales orders, you can attach these files to the records.

There's a couple ways you can attach files. One way is to upload files from your device. The other way is upload files that are attached to an email. For example, suppose you get an email with files from a contact. The add-in will automatically display the contact record that matches the email sender. From there, you can navigate to a document for the contact, like the latest sales order. Once you've identified the order that the email relates to, you quickly upload the files from the email to that order.

![Shows how to add attachments from an email to records in Business Central.](media/outlook-attach-files.png)

After attaching a file, coworkers can instantly download and view the file from the **Attachments** FactBox in any of their Business Central clients. Or, they can open the file in OneDrive to share and collaborate with their department.

#### How to attach a file

1. Open the email, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**  > **Contact Insights**.
2. In the action bar of the add-in, choose **Show more actions** > **Attachments**.

    The **Attached Documents** page opens to list any documents that are already attached to the record.
3. Choose **Attached File(s)...**, then choose one of the following options:

   - Choose **Attach from email** to upload all or selected files that are attached to the email.
   - Choose **Upload from file** to upload one or files from your device.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't attach files to all records. This feature is available for records that use the **Attachments** FactBox, such as a vendor, customer, purchase invoice, or sales order.

## View a document from an email using the Document View add-in

Whether it's an email you sent or received, you can surface any [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] document, like the sales quote, directly in Outlook. From there, you can make changes and navigate to related information&mdash;just as you would from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

If you're using the Outlook app, just choose **Document Link** at the top of the email message. For Outlook on the web, look for the document reference link in the email message. The reference link text will include the document number, which is based on the number series used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, the link for a sales quote would be something like **Sales Quote S-QUO1000**.  

> [!TIP]
> Starting in 2022 release wave 1, documents open in a new browser window with all the capabilities that you know from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can navigate from a document to a list and back again, open lists in Excel, send documents to be printed, and run or preview related reports. You also have all of the familiar keyboard shortcuts right there when you open documents from Outlook.

# Posting sales

Under the **Posting** menu in a sales document, you can choose between the following posting functions:

* **Post**
* **Post and New**
* **Post and Send**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post Batch**
* **Test Report**

> [!NOTE]
> For sales orders, you can also see options related to the prepayments functionality. For more information, see [Invoicing Prepayments](finance-invoice-prepayments.md).

When you have completed all the lines and entered all the information on the sales order, you can post it. This creates a shipment and an invoice.

When a sales order is posted, the customer's account, the general ledger, and the item ledger entries are updated.

For each sales order, a sales entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

For each sales order line, an item ledger entry will be created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry will be created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition to this, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

You can either post, or post and send. If you choose to post and send, a PDF file is generated that you can then send. You can also choose the **Post Batch** function, which lets you post several orders at the same time. For more information, see [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted sales lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. After this, you'll be able to see the posted entries in the various pages that contain posted entries, such as the **Cust. Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Posted Sales Shipments**, and **Posted Sales Invoices** pages.  

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Package Tracking No.** field. For more information, see [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article describes how to install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps are specific to each functional area of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps include:

- APIs for reading data.
- [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models and reports.
- Pages that embed the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- Navigation links on Role Centers and in the Role Explorer.

## Prerequisites

To install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must have:

- An environment in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (it comes ready to integrate with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].)

- Entitlements/permissions in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] to:

    - Install template apps from AppSource.
    - Use shared workspaces.

The prerequisites for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] can be met with a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license for the following users:

   - The user who installs the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app.
   - The user who refreshes the data.
   - Each user who accesses the reports, either in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service or embedded in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

An alternative to using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses is to use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] or [!INCLUDE [fabric-name](includes/fabric-name.md)] Premium capacity.

To learn more, go to [Get started with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-working-with-powerbi.md#get-started).

## Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

Each app consists of two parts:

- A connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports.

You must install and configure both apps for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports to work.

### Installing the connector (AL) app

The connector apps are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app

Template apps are available to install from Microsoft AppSource. To install or update one or more of the template apps, go to one of the install links in the following table and select **Get it now**.

| To get the template app for... | Use this install link             |

Sign in to Microsoft AppSource using your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account credentials. Follow the instructions to install the app in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].

After you install it, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app appears under **Apps** in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], and there's a workspace with the same name that you can use to configure the app.

When you install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] subscription, you must choose a workspace for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and reports. We recommend that you use one workspace for each app because it's easier to set up functional boundaries with access controls for users and user groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app, you need a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license.

### Need Power BI apps for multiple companies?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]


## Run the Connect to Power BI assisted setup guide

After you install your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, you can configure them to suit your business:

- Get help with the set-up process by using the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.
- Set up things yourself on the **[Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951)** page.

The assisted setup guide helps you configure the following components:

1. [Calendar Type](#configure-the-calendar-type)
1. [UTC Offset](#specify-the-utc-offset)
1. [Date Table Range](#set-up-a-date-table-range)
1. [Work Days](#specify-work-days)
1. [Report Mapping](#map-embedded-reports)

### Configure the calendar type

Choose the type of calendar the year boundaries apply to.

- **Fiscal**: A 12-month calendar that begins in any month and ends 12 months after.
- **Standard**: A 12-month calendar that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.
- **Weekly**: A calendar that supports 445, 454, or 544 week groupings. The first and last day of the year might not correspond to a first and last day of a month, respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, all [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports are configured to use Fiscal Calendar date fields and Fiscal Time Intelligence measures.

<!-- If you choose a calendar type other than Fiscal, you will need to edit the Power BI reports and change the date field references and measure references accordingly.  -->

### Specify the UTC offset

The UTC offset defines the UTC time zone in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] date table.

The UTC offset allows your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model to accurately calculate what the current day is in respect to your geographical location. This setting is necessary because your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps might be hosted in a data center located in a different region.

UTC offsets are based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] time zones.

### Set up a date table range

The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields are set automatically based on your accounting periods in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Based on these dates, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] generates a series of continuous dates for your date table.

> [!NOTE]
> If your budgets extend past the last date in your Account Period table, you must manually set the ending date to accommodate the extended range.

### Specify work days

You can define the days of the week you consider as work days. The default setting is Monday to Friday.

### Map embedded reports

To enable the embedded report pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up links to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service.

1. For each functional area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select the ellipsis to open the **Select Power BI Workspace** page.
1. Select the workspace where you store the corresponding [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app.
1. Select the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report (app) you want to map.

## Restrict the amount of data that loads to Power BI

If you want to restrict the amount of data that loads to the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], you can define filters on each app.

On the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page, choose an app for which you want to set up data filtering. The semantic models use these settings when they refresh the data.

All apps support start and end date filtering, where you specify the start and end date of an interval.

Some apps also support other filter options, such as *Start/End Date* or *Relative Date*. With the *Relative Date* type, you can apply a custom date formula.

## Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central

Do this part of the configuration in the semantic models in your [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com).

Each semantic model requires two parameters:

- Environment (holds the environment name)
- Company (holds the company name. The company parameter is case sensitive. )

You can find these values in the connection details of the assisted setup guide or on the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page.

To set or change values for the parameters, open the app workspace in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Locate the semantic model, and choose **More options**. Now choose **Settings**, and then **Parameters**.

## Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)

Each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app is based on a semantic model (also known as a dataset) that gets data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] APIs. Make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing* the model. Depending on your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] setup, refreshing might not happen automatically. You can refresh data manually, or by scheduling a refresh. You can do a manual refresh at any time. A scheduled refresh lets you refresh data automatically at defined time intervals.

To learn more, go to [Refresh [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models](/dynamics365/business-central/across-working-with-powerbi#work-with-power-bi-reports).

## Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries

For dimension set entries to show up in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, the job queue entry that runs the *Update Dim. Set Entries* codeunit must run at least one time. If you change dimension sets or values, the codeunit must run again. Therefore, we recommend that you run the corresponding job queue entry one time each week, or maybe once a night outside normal working hours.

## Permissions

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the user account you use to refresh the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] must have Read permissions to the tables in the model. These tables are currently documented in the KPI article for the app. For example, for the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app-name](includes/power-bi-sales-app-name.md)], these are the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables that the user needs Read permissions for: [KPIs and measures in the Power BI Sales app](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md)

In the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], we recommend that you add multiple admins for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app workspace. Grant Read permissions to users who should be able to view report pages in an app.

For the embedded pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are permission sets for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app. If you need to exclude read access to all or some of these pages, you can exclude the permission set (or permission on individual pages) for the users.

## Governance of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspaces

Consider having the template app workspaces highly governed and not used directly for the embedded experience. To learn more, go to [Workspace governance level](/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning#workspace-governance-level).

Instead, consider having a single workspace per company that you use for the embed experience. In this workspace, keep copies or custom versions of the template reports. This helps mitigate the problem of losing report customizations when you upgrade the template app workspace. To learn more about how to copy a report to another workspace, go to [Copy reports from other workspaces](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-copy-reports).

## Updating a Power BI app

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are available as template app on AppSource. When a new version of a template app becomes available, we notify you in two ways:

- An update banner displays in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] informing you that a new version is available.
- A notification displays in Power BI's notification pane.

When you update a template app, it's important that you're aware of your options and how they might overwrite earlier changes to the reports. You can choose to:

- Update the workspace and the app.
- Update workspace content only, without updating the app.
- Install another copy of the app in a new workspace.

To learn more, go to [Install, share, and update template apps in your organization](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-install-distribute#update-a-template-app).

# (Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

By default, reports have a built-in layout. The report layout can be either an RDLC (report definition language client side) report layout, a Microsoft Word report layout, or both. And while you can't modify built-in layouts, you can create custom layouts. A report can have multiple custom report layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations you send to customers as PDF files.

To create a custom layout, either copy an existing custom layout or add a new custom layout. Custom layouts are often based on a built-in layout. When you add a new custom layout, you can choose to add either an RDLC or a Word report layout type, or both. The new custom layout is based on the built-in layout for the report, if one is available. If there's no built-in layout for the report type, a new blank layout is created. You modify and design this blank layout from scratch. Learn more about RDLC, Word, built-in, and custom layouts in [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Learn more at [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

After you define your custom report layouts, you can select them on the customer card and vendor card pages. The layouts are then used when you create documents for the customer or vendor. Learn more at [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

You can also use custom report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Create a custom layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports available in the company specified in the **Company Name** field at the top of the page.
1. In the **Company Name** field, choose the company you want to create the report layout for.
1. Select the row for the report you want to create the layout for, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

   The **Custom Report Layouts** page appears and lists all the custom layouts available for the selected report.
1. If you want to create a copy of an existing custom layout, select the existing custom layout in the list, then choose the **Copy** action.  

   The copy of the custom layout appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page and has the words *Copy of* in the **Description** field.
1. If you want to add a new custom layout based on a built-in layout, follow these steps:  
   1. Choose the **New** action. The **Insert Built-in Layout for a Report** page appears with the **ID** and **Name** fields automatically filled in.
   1. Turn on the **Insert Word Layout** toggle to add a custom Word report layout type OR turn on the **Insert RDLC Layout** toggle to add a custom RDLC report layout type.
   1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The new custom layout now appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If a new layout is based on a built-in layout, then the words **Copy of a Built-in Layout** appear in the **Description** field. If there was no built-in layout for the report, then the new layout has the words **New Layout** in the **Description** field, which means that custom layout is blank.
1. By default, the **Company Name** field is blank and the custom layout is available for reports by all companies. To make the custom layout available to a specific company only, choose **Edit**, then set the **Company Name** field to the company you want.

The custom layout is created and you can modify it as you like.

> [!TIP]
> You can export the report results to a Microsoft Excel file to view the full dataset, including all columns, but without the layout. The Excel file can help you validate the report returns the expected data or diagnose problems. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel](report-analyze-excel.md).

## <a name="ModifyCustomLayout"></a>Modifying a custom layout

To modify a custom report layout, you must first export the report layout as a file to a location on your computer or network. Then, open the exported document and make the changes. When you're finished making the changes, you import the report layout.

### Modify a custom layout

1. Export a custom layout from the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If that page isn't already open, search for and open the **Report Layout Selection** page, select the report that has the layout you want to modify, then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  
1. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the layout you want to modify, choose the **Export Layout** action, then choose **Save** or **Save As** to save the report layout document to a location on your computer or network.  
1. Open the report layout document you saved and make changes.

   If you're changing a Word layout, open the layout document in Word. Learn more about editing Word reports at [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)<!--the next section [Making Changes to the Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#MakeChangesToLayout)-->.

   RDLC report layouts are more advanced than Word report layouts. Learn more about modifying an RDLC report layout at [Designing RDLC Report Layouts](/dynamics-nav/Designing-RDLC-Report-Layouts).

   Remember to save your changes when you're done.

1. Return to the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the report layout you exported and modified, then choose the **Import Layout** action.  
1. In the **Import** dialog box, select **Choose** to find and select the modified report layout document, then choose **Open**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to import the report layout document that you modified. Otherwise, the new report layout isn't available.

<!--
##  <a name="MakeChangesToLayout"></a> Create and modify custom report layouts

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

### Embedding fonts in Word layouts for consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

###  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields in Word layouts

 Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

 ![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

 The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field you want to delete, then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.  

### Adding data fields

Adding data fields from a report dataset is more advanced and requires some knowledge of the report dataset. Learn more about adding fields for data, labels, and images at [Add Fields to a Word Report Layout](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).  -->

# Set Up Service Contracts
Before you can work with contracts, you must set up the following: 

* **Service contract groups**, which gather service contracts that are related in some way.
* **Service contract account groups**, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for service invoices created for service contracts. You assign these groups to service contracts.  
* **Contract templates** that define contract layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. When you create a contract quote, the fields automatically contain the contents of the template fields.
* **Customer templates** that let you create quotes for contacts or potential customers who are not registered as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## To set up a service contract group  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Disc. on Contr. Orders Only** check box if you want contract or service discounts to be valid only for contract service orders, such as maintenance.  

## To set up a service contract account group  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Serv. Contract Account Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract account group.   
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields. These fields describe the service account group.  
4. Fill in the **Non-Prepaid Contract Acc.** field, choose general ledger account number for the non-prepaid account.  
5. In the **Prepaid Contract Acc.** field, choose the general ledger account number for the prepaid account.

# Set up basic warehouses with operations areas

If you have internal operation areas, such as production or assembly areas, you can use the following basic warehouse documents to record your warehouse activities:  

- **Inventory Movement** page.  
- **Inventory Pick** page.  
- **Inventory Put-away** page.

To use these documents, you must set up one or more of the following fields on the the **Location Card** page for the location:

- The **Bin Mandatory** field.
- The **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Movement** option in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still post output and consumption directly from the source documents and journals.  

To use these pages with internal operations such as to pick and move components to production, depending on how much control you need you must do some or all the following steps:  

- Enable the inventory pick, move, and put-away documents.  
- Define default bin structures for components and end items flowing to and from operation resources.  
- Make to- and from- bins that are dedicated to specific operation resources. Dedicated bins prevent the items from being picked for outbound documents.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for certain activities, such as components in an assembly department. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a certain bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities. To learn more, go to [To create dedicated component bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md#to-create-dedicated-component-bins).

The following procedures are based on setting up basic warehouse activities around a production area. The steps are similar for other operation areas, such as assembly, service management, and jobs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures assume that the **Bin Mandatory** toggle is turned on for the location.  

## To enable inventory documents for internal operation activities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location card you want to set up.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field to indicate that when someone releases an internal source document with a bin code, an inventory put-away or movement document can be created.  
4. To require that an inventory pick or an inventory movement document when you create an outbound or internal source document with a bin code, fill in the following fields:

   - In the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling field**, choose **Inventory Pick/Movement**.
   - In the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, choose **Inventory Movement**.  

## To define a default bin structure in the production area

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.  
3. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area with plenty of components that the machine operator can consume from without requesting a warehouse activity to bring them to the bin. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for automatic posting, or flushing. This setup means that the **Flushing Method** field contains **Forward**, **Backward**, or **Manual**.  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also record flushing without requiring a pick. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To flush without picking, the item must use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

4. In the **To-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where components that are picked for production at this location are placed by default before they can be consumed. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for manual picking. The **Flushing Method** field contains **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward**, or **Pick + Manual** for warehouse picks and inventory movements.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line defines the *take* bin from where components are decreased when posting consumption. When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area where the warehouse worker must place the components.  

5. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **From-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where finished end items are taken from by default when the process involves a warehouse activity. In basic warehouse configurations, the activity is recorded as an inventory put-away or an inventory movement.  

Now, production order component lines with the default bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

This flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled according to your setup.  

![Bin flow chart.](media/binflow.png "BinFlow")

## To define a default bin structure in the assembly area

Components for assembly orders can't be picked or posted with inventory picks. Instead, use the **Inventory Movement** page. To learn more, go to [Pick or move for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Basic Warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, you must follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

To learn more, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

### To set up that an inventory movement is automatically created when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** checkbox.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where components are placed by default before they can be consumed in assembly

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order lines when this location is entered in the **Location Code** field on the assembly order line.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **To-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to stock

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order headers when this location code is filled into the **Location Code** field on the assembly order header.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for specific warehouse activities, such as consumption of components in an assembly area. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a default bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is only possible for locations where the **Bin Mandatory** field is selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to a linked sales order

From this bin, the assembly items are shipped immediately, via an inventory pick, to fulfill the sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use this field if the location is set up to use directed pick and put-away.

The bin code is copied from the sales order line to the assembly order header to communicate to assembly workers where to place the output to ready it for shipping. It's also copied to the inventory pick line to communicate to warehouse workers where to take it from to ship it.

> [!NOTE]
> The Assemble-to-Order Shipment bin is always empty. When you post an assemble-to-order sales line, then the bin content is first positively adjusted with the assembly output. Immediately after, it's negatively adjusted with the shipped quantity.

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the Bin Code field on sales order lines that contain a quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field or if the item to be sold has **Assemble-to-Order** in the **Replenishment System** field.

If the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** is blank, then the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field is used instead. If both setup fields are blank, then the last used bin with content is used in the **Bin Code** field on sales order lines.

The same bin code is in turn copied to the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line that manages the shipment of the assemble-to-order quantity. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** field.

## To create dedicated component bins

You can specify that quantities in a bin are protected from being picked for other demands than demand from their current purpose.

Quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

For example, is a work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

Making a bin dedicated provides similar functionality to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. To learn more, go to [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production components with the Inventory Pick page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. Select the location that you want to update.  
2. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the **Dedicated** field for each bin that you want to use exclusively for certain internal operations and where you want quantities to be reserved for that internal operation once placed there.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The bin must be empty before you can select or clear the **Dedicated** field.

# Create recurring sales

If you often need to create sales lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring sales documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.  

## Set up recurring sales lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Sales Lines**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter information in the fields to prepare sales lines that reflect the standard lines that you expect to use as recurring lines on sales documents.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring sales lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual sales documents after you insert the recurring sales lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring sales lines to a customer

Assign one or more recurring sales lines to a customer so that they are available to insert on sales documents for that customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant customer.
3. Select **Related** and **Sales**
4. Choose the **Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, select codes for the recurring sales lines that you want to be able to insert on sales documents for the customer.
6. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring sales lines are to be used.  

    If you plan to use the recurring sales lines set together with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job, use the **Valid From Date** and **Valid To Date** fields to restrict when the recurring sales lines are used for creation of invoices. For more information, see [Create multiple sales invoices based on standard sales lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md#create-multiple-sales-invoices-based-on-recurring-sales-lines).

    You can also specify a direct-debit payment method and a direct-debit mandate. The sales invoices that are created with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job will then include the information required to collect payment with SEPA direct debit. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

7. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on four document types, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring sales line that exists for the customer.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring sales line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Sales Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a customer card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring sales lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring sales lines on a sales invoice

If recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you can insert them, or have them inserted, on all types of sales documents, such as a sales invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring sales lines to customers, you'll be informed if recurring sales lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to insert one or more standard sales lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard sales lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard sales lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

## Create multiple sales invoices based on recurring sales lines

You can use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to standard sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the standard sales lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Recurring Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **Code** filter field, enter the code for standard sales lines that are assigned to a customer that you want to create sales invoices for.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

Sales invoices are created for the customers with the specified standard customer sales code, and any specified direct-debit information, for posting on the specified date.

# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png":::

## How to use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Moving Annual Total (MAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal)
- [**Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal)
- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning" toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# Power BI Sales app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The reports in the Power BI Sales app provide comprehensive sales analytics to stakeholders at all levels of your organization.

Executives and the leadership team can use the [Sales Overview](sales-powerbi-sales-overview.md), [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md), and [Month-To-Date](sales-powerbi-month-to-date.md) reports to identify trends in sales performance.

Managers and team leaders can track individual sales team performance using the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report. They can also monitor overall team progress toward meeting sales goals by comparing actual results against targets in the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md)  report.

Sales teams can use aggregated reports, such as the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports, to identify top-selling items and the customers that generate the most revenue. You can drill down from these aggregated views into transaction-level data for more detailed analyses.

You can use the reports in the Power BI Sales app for different things, depending on your role. This article provides some examples of use cases for different roles in your organization.

## Sales analytics for the leadership team

The leadership team can use the app to gain a high-level overview of the organization's sales trends and financial health. The app helps leaders identify spending patterns, monitor budget adherence, and make strategic decisions to improve financial performance. It provides a clear picture of sales efficiency and highlights areas for potential cost reduction.

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Example scenario: preparing for an upcoming board meeting

Imagine you're the CEO of a company, and you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting. You need to present an analysis of your company's sales performance for the current fiscal year. To better understand the company's current position, you can use the Power BI Sales app.

Start by reviewing the [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md) report, which provides a quick, comparative view of the current year versus the previous year. Sales are up by 35%, outlined by the [Sales Amount MATG % (Fiscal)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) metric shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Period-Over-Period Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png":::

Next, you review the [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) report to identify which group of customers contributed most to sales. The **Sales by Customer** matrix shows that domestic customers outperformed foreign customers by contributing 56.59% to the total annual sales, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png":::

Finally, you review the [Moving Averages](sales-powerbi-moving-average.md) report, which visualizes [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount) and [Sales Amount Average 30D](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-avg-30d-fiscal). The 30 day average smooths out the sales trend for the year and provides more good news for the company. On average, sales were stable through the first half of the year and then increased through the second half of the year.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Moving Average Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png":::

The insights you gained from this report let you confidently present your organization's sales performance to the board, armed with data-driven analysis and a deeper understanding of your company's current position.

## Sales analytics for the management team

The goal of the sales management team is to effectively oversee and manage sales processes. <!--This app allows you to track -->

To fit this category, your job title might be:

- Sales Manager
- Sales Team Leader

### Example scenario: driving sales over the next two quarters

As a Sales Manager, you're tasked with driving sales over the next two quarters. You turn to the Power BI Sales app to understand the sales team's current standing.

Start by reviewing the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report to evaluate individual team performance. You quickly identify Jim Olive as the top performer, generating 83% of the total sales for the year. You also see that Helena Ray was the most profitable salesperson on the team, but only by a small margin.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png":::

You know that clear targets help Lina and Helena reach their maximum potential. By establishing a new sales budget with revised targets for each salesperson, you can provide your team with the tools they need to progress. Using the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report, you monitor progress to ensure the team is on track to meet their new goals.

The [Daily Sales](sales-powerbi-daily-sales.md) report lets you monitor the team's progress over the next two quarters. You can use the heat map to gauge which day of the week the team performs best, and when the company should roll out marketing incentives to help drive customer engagement.

## Sales analytics for daily sales work

People who work with sales on a daily basis often focus on handling day-to-day sales tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

To fit this category, you might have a job title such as:

- Account Manager
- Sales Person

### Example scenario: using data to drive day-to-day sales

After the sales team receives the new sales targets from the sales manager, they're eager to improve their performance and meet the revised goals. To shape an effective strategy as a salesperson, you turn to the Power BI Sales app for insights into the company's sales patterns.

Start by analyzing the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports to identify high-potential products and key customers. These aggregated reports provide a clear view of where opportunities lie. That information helps you focus on the customers and items most likely to generate growth and help your team achieve their targets.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix version 2" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png":::

The [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) report highlights product performance by clearly identifying which items generate the most revenue and, conversely, which items experienced a decline in sales. Targeting key products lets you and your team prioritize your efforts on highly profitable items and items with growing demand.

# Marketing text suggestions with Copilot overview

<!--[!INCLUDE[ai-preview](includes/ai-preview.md)]-->

This article gives an overview the AI-powered capability provided by Copilot in Business Central.

## What is AI-powered item marketing text with Copilot

Copilot provides AI-powered writing assistance for Business Central users responsible for authoring marketing text (product descriptions) on items sold in online shops, like Shopify. With the click of a button, Copilot generates text that's engaging and creative, and that highlights key attributes of the specific item. With a bit of reviewing and editing, it's ready to publish.

Copilot uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to access language models that recognize, predict, and generate text that's based on trained datasets. Learn more at [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=aeb1c87f-2489-41f8-a3cf-28ed5e4196e4]

*The video doesn't exactly reflect how the feature currently works or looks in the product. The feature has changed since the video was produced. But it gives you a general idea of the feature and what you can use it for.*
  
## Where it's used

Copilot is available on item cards in Business Central. In Business Central, items are like products in other applications and shops. Each item can be managed from a card where you enter details about the item, like its dimensions, cost, or picture. This card also includes a box for entering marketing text. This marketing text can be published to your online shop to promote the item. Here's where Copilot comes in. By just selecting the **Draft with Copilot** action on the item card, Copilot will generate an intelligent draft text for you. Once you get the first draft, you can run Copilot again and again until you get a draft you like. When you have suggestion you like, you review and edit it for accuracy, then save it.

If Business Central is set up to connect to your online store on Shopify, you can take this text even further by publishing it with the item directly to your store by selecting **Add to Shopify**.

## Why and how to use it

AI-generated text can help you accelerate the time-to-market of products in online shops by limiting time used on copy writing. Some key benefits include:

- Helps users overcome writer's block by getting them started with an intelligent draft.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing content for product lines.

You should consider the AI-generated text as a *suggestion only*. Suggestions can, in some cases, contain mistakes and even inappropriate text, so human oversight and review are required. Before you make the text publicly available, you must review it for accuracy and make appropriate changes.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support.md](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Current limitations

Poor suggestions can result when vague or generic product names are used and specifics about an item are missing, like key attributes or a category.

<!-- Partner extensibility of the AI capability by using AL code isn't supported.-->

## Next steps

To get started, you'll need a Business Central (v23.1 and later) environment that's enabled with Copilot.

- If you're an existing Business Central customer, your Business Central admin will have to set up an environment that's enabled for marketing text suggestions. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

- If you're not a Business Central customer but want to try it out, you can sign up for a free trial. Learn more in [Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial](trial-signup.md).

Once you have an environment or trail that ready, go to [Add marketing text to items with Copilot](item-marketing-text.md).

# Set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service

You can import electronic bank statements from your bank to quickly fill on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page so you can apply payments and reconcile the bank account. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. This functionality is not supported for on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments hosted on Embed ISV application services. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a co-brand account from Envestnet, and you must add code to integrate with the Yodlee API.
>
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For technical assistance with the Envestnet Yodlee functionality, contact Microsoft Support. Do not contact Envestnet Yodlee. For more information, see [Configuring Technical Support for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support).

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is installed as an extension to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and is ready to be enabled in the supported countries/regions. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

After you enable the bank feed service, you must link a bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

* A bank account doesn't exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
* A bank account exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which you want to link to an online bank account.
* A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
* Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When the bank feed service is enabled, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statements into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page every two hours. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page won't be imported. For more information, see the “To enable automatic import of bank statements” section.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the Set Up Company assisted setup guide, some of the steps in the following procedures happen automatically when you get to the company bank account setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## To enable the bank feed service

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the bank account that you'll use for the bank feed service.
3. On the **Bank Account Card** page, in the **Bank Statement Import Format** field, select YODLEEBANKFEED.  

The bank feed service is enabled when you link a bank account to its related online bank account. See the next procedure.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide, then you enable the service by selecting the **Use a bank feed service** check box. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in Business Central](about-new-company.md).

## To create a new linked bank account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Create New Linked Bank Account**. The **Bank Account Linking** page opens after a few moments.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This page shows the actual web page of the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. Terminology and functionality on the page may not match instructions provided in this topic.  
3. On the **Online Bank Account Linking** page, in the **Link Account** pane, use the Search function to find the bank where you have one or more online bank accounts.
4. Choose the bank name. The **Log In** pane opens.
5. Enter the username and password that you use to sign in to the online bank, and then choose the **Next** button.  
6. The bank feed service prepares to link the first online bank account at the specified bank to a new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have more than one online bank account at the bank, you must create additional bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for them. See steps 8 through 10.  

    After the process completes, the bank name will appear in the **My Accounts** pane on the **Linked** tab. The number in brackets indicates how many online bank accounts were linked.  
7. Choose the **OK** button.

    If you're only linking one online bank account, the **Bank Account Card** page opens and displays the name of the online bank account. In this case, the bank account linking task is completed. All that's left to do is to set up the bank account. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

    If you're linking more than one online bank accounts, the **Bank Account Linking** page opens and lists the online bank accounts that aren't yet linked to bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In that case, follow the next step.  
8. On the **Bank Account Linking** page, select the line for an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to New Bank Account** action.  

    The **Bank Account Card** page for a new bank account opens and displays the name of the online bank account.

    If a bank account already exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want to link the additional online bank account to, follow the next step.  
9. On the **Bank Account Linking** page, select the line for an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to Existing Bank Account** action.
10. On the **Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to link to, and then choose the **OK** button.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a bank account that isn't linked to an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to Online Bank Account** action. The **Online Bank Account Linking** page opens with the name of the bank prefilled in the **Link Account** pane.
3. Choose the bank name. The **Log In** pane opens.
4. Enter the username and password that you use to sign in to the online bank, and then choose the **Next** button.  

    The bank feed service prepares to link your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank account.  

    When the process has completed successfully, the bank name will appear in the **My Accounts** pane on the **Linked** tab. If the bank has more than one bank account, only the bank account that you selected in step 2 is linked.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Bank Account List** page, the **Linked** check box is selected.

## To edit the credentials for an online bank account

# Released Production Orders (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Released Production Orders** report provides detailed information about all released production orders, including expected versus finished quantities and the variance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Released Production Orders Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track released production orders. By analyzing the expected versus finished quantities, you can find issues that might affect the production process. For example, if the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, it might indicate a problem with the manufacturing process or materials. By identifying and addressing these issues, you can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor expected and finished quantities. This information helps you prioritize and schedule the next items for production. For example, if the finished quantity is close to the expected quantity, you can prioritize the next item for production. If the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, you might need to adjust the production schedule to ensure you compete the order on time.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Released Production Orders* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-quantity-base)
- [Finished Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#finished-quantity-base)
- [Qty. Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-variance)

- Item
- Production Order

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Create service items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "service item" refers to equipment or items that require service. When you create a service order, you specify the items that need service. In the order, you can link a service item to an item in inventory or a service item group.

When you receive an item that needs service, you can register it as a service item. There are several ways to do so. For example, you can create a service item on the **Service Items** page, or as part of another process, such as when working with a service order.

## To create a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To create service items within a service order

When you receive items for service that you want to register as service items, you can create them as service items in the **Service Order** or **Service Quote** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Create Service Item** action.  

    A number is assigned to the service item and a service item card is created. The **Service Item No.** field is filled in with the number of the new service item.

## To create a service item when shipping items

When you ship items by posting either sales orders or sales invoices, the shipped items are automatically registered as service items if the following condition is met. The items must belong to a service item group with the **Create Service Item** check box selected. If the items have serial numbers registered in the Item Tracking Lines page, this information is copied automatically to the **Serial No.** field on the service item card when creating service items.  

The following procedure shows how to create service items when you ship items on sales orders.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.  
3. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Print** action.  
4. Choose the **Ship** or **Ship and Invoice** action.  
5. The service items are automatically created for the items on the order, provided these belong to a service item group that you have set up to create service items. If you registered specific serial numbers on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, they will be assigned to these service items.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an item is a BOM and you have exploded the BOM, the exploded BOM items are processed in the same way as regular items. Service items are created based on the service items group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition. Additionally, if a service item is created for an exploded BOM item that is made up of other BOM components, these items are created as service item components for the exploded BOM service item.  
>
> If an item is a BOM and you have not exploded the BOM, a service item is created for it based on the service item group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition.  

## To insert a starting fee for a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action.
3. Choose the service line, and then choose **Actions**, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Starting Fee** action.  

    A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the selected service item.

## Block items, item variants, or specific service items

You can prevent items, item variants, or service items from being used in service management transactions, such as service contracts, service orders, and service invoices. This can be useful if you want to restrict the availability of some items or service items for service purposes, for example, due to discontinued support, limited stock, or contractual agreements.

To block an item or an item variant from being used in service management transactions, turn on the **Service Blocked** toggle on the **Item Card**, **Item Variants**, and **Item Variant Card** page. You can also set this field on the **Item Template** page, and it will be copied to the items created from that template.

When an item or an item variant is service blocked, it isn't available for selection on the following pages:

- Service Line (except for service credit memos, where you'll see a notification that the item or variant is blocked, but allowed on this type of document)
- Service Item
- Service Contract Line
- Standard Service Line

If you manually enter an item number or variant that's blocked, you'll get an error message that states, "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items or item variants, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** or **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page.
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, **Create Contract Service Orders** or **Create Contract Invoices**  on the **Service Contract** page.
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** page.
- **Release to Ship** or **Post** on the **Service Order** page.
- **Post** in the **Service Invoice** page.

### Block a service item

To block a service item from being used in service management transactions, on the **Service Item Card** page, in the **Blocked** field, choose one of the following options:

- **Service Contract**: Block the service item from being used in service contracts and service contract quotes, but not in service orders or other service documents.
- **All**: Block the service item from being used in any service management transaction, including service contracts, service orders, and other service documents.

When a service item is blocked, you can't select it on the following pages:

- Service Contract Line (if blocked for service contract, or all)
- Service Item Line (except for service credit memos, if blocked for all)

If you manually enter a service item number for a blocked service item, an error message displays "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** and **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, or **Change Customer** on the **Service Contract** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** (if blocked for all).
- **Release to Ship**, **Post** on the **Service Order** (if blocked for all. If service order documents contain multiple service items, and some are blocked and others are not, you can release and post non-blocked lines. Consider whether to turn on the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle on the **Service Management Setup** page).
- **Post** on the **Service Invoice** page (if blocked for all).

You can also view the blocked service items by applying a filter to the following reports:

- Service Items (report 5935)
- Service Items Out of Warranty (report 5937)
- Service Profit (Service Items) (report 5938)

### Data upgrade

This feature doesn't require additional setup. However, if you upgrade your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], be aware of the following:

- If you have items, item variants, or item templates where the **Sales Blocked** toggle is turned on, the **Service Blocked** field is also turned on for those records during upgrade. This ensures that the existing sales blocked logic also applies to service management transactions.
- Data upgrades only if you have at least one service item in your company, which means you're using the service management functionality and need the data upgrade. If you don't have service items, the data upgrade is skipped and the **Service Blocked** toggle is turned off by default for all items, item variants, and item templates.

# Sales tax in the default version of Business Central

A **sales tax** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. Sales tax, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but, generally speaking, business-to-business transactions are exempted from sales tax.  

Typically, sales taxes apply to the retail sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting sales tax at the time of purchase.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries/regions that use value-added tax (VAT) or that use sales tax. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for sales tax and richer support in the versions of the application used in the United States and Canada.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although sales tax is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of sales tax in the United States and Canada only.

# Status Field on Documents

When you create a quote, order, or credit memo, the **Status** field on the document header contains the status **Open** by default.

After you've filled in the document, you can release it, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the value in the **Status** field to **Released**. This status indicates that the order is ready for the next stage of processing before it's posted.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Open   | You can make changes to the document. |
| Released | The document has been released to the next stage of processing, and you can't make changes to lines of type *Item* and *Fixed Asset*.<br /><br />You can reopen a released document if you want to make changes to its contents. To move the adjusted document to the next stage of processing, you must once again release the document. |
| Pending Approval   | The document is waiting to be approved. |
| Pending Prepayment | A prepayment invoice has been posted for the document. |

## Release process

You can use the release process in different ways to ease your normal workflow, for example, to follow company procedures about approvals or to start warehouse activities.

### Approval procedures

Your company can use the release procedure to indicate that another user has approved the document or that an external contact can meet the specifications of the document, as shown in these examples:

* You can only release a purchase order when your vendor has indicated that they're prepared to fulfill the order.
* You create an order and a second user must approve it, perhaps for security reasons, before you're allowed to release it.
* The manager responsible for approving all refunds must release a credit memo that you've created.

Learn more about approval workflows at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

### Warehouse activities

If the order status is **Open**, the warehouse won't begin to prepare the shipment, and doesn't expect to receive the items on a purchase order. When you release the order, you indicate that the order is complete, and that the warehouse can include it in its activities.

## Reopen a released order

You can make changes to a released order by reopening it. However, you can only increase the quantity of the lines already processed by the warehouse.

When you make the changes and release the order again, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value-added tax (VAT) and the invoice discount.

If you make changes to a released order, you must notify the warehouse about the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to post a single open order or credit memo without releasing it first, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically release the document when you post it. If you post your orders or credit memos by using the **Post Batch** function, you can choose to post only the orders or credit memos that you've released.

# Configure API Templates

The API library for [!INCLUDE[prod_short_md](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a simplified representation of the underlying entities. All the properties in the application are not exposed through the associated API. The **API Setup** page allows you to define templates that are used to populate empty properties on an entity when you create a POST action through the API. 

For example, if a configuration template is defined for the item entity, when a new item record is created through the items API, any properties for the new item that are not defined in the API call will be populated from the selected template. If, for example, no value is defined for the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field through the API, but a value is defined in the selected template, then the posting group value defined in the template will be applied to the new item. 

## Setting up the Entity Template

To use templates with the API library, you must first set up and define properties for the templates. You can set up these templates on the **Configuration Templates** page. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) (in English only) in the administration content.  

## Assign the template to an API

To assign a template to an API, you must go through the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> API templates can only be set up with the following API pages: contacts, countriesRegions, currencies, customers, employees, itemCategories, paymentMethods, paymentTerms, shipmentMethods, unitsOfMeasure, and vendors.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **API Setup**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, and then choose the **Order** value for the record.  

    If there is more than one template selected for an API (Page ID), the templates are applied in the order defined in the **Order** column.  

    When each template is applied, field values defined in the template are only applied to fields that have not already had a value defined, either explicitly in the API, or in a previously applied template in the order.  
3. Select a **Page ID** value.  

    This is the page for the API to which the template will be applied. The **Page ID** lookup provides a list of all APIs available in the library.
4. Select a value in the **Template Code** field.  

    The template code is the code for the template that was defined on the **Configuration Templates** page. The template values defined are applied to the API.  
5. In the **Conditions** field, specify which template should be applied.  

    The defined template is applied to a new record created through the API if, and only if, the conditions defined in the **Conditions** field are met by the values already defined for the new instance of the entity.

# Trace item-tracked items

You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the [Find Entries](ui-find-entries.md) features.  

These features can be useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.  

 On the **Item Tracing** page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.  

 On the **Find Entries** page, you can't see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.  

 The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the **Find Entries** page to finish a complete trace scenario. <!-- For more information, see [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).   -->

## To trace item-tracked items  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the filter fields at the top of the page, enter the specific item numbers or a filter on the item numbers that you would like to trace.  
3.  In the **Show Components** field, select whether to also see where the components for the items came from. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No**|Don't show components.|  
    |**Item-tracked Only**|Show only components that have lot or serial numbers.|  
    |**All**|Show all components.|  

4.  In the **Trace Method** field, select the method to use for tracing the item. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Usage->Origin**|Trace the item from where it was used to where it came from. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the sales shipment line first, which you can then expand to see from which production order it came.|  
    |**Origin->Usage**|Trace the item from where it came into inventory to where it was used. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the finished production order first, which you can then expand to see the sale shipment lines where the item was used.|  

5.  Choose the **Trace** action to run the trace.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Only applied transactions are shown. If you have received the same lot on multiple transactions, the **Item Tracing** page may not show all transactions.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the **Already Traced** check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.  
>   
>  To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the **Go to Already Traced** button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.  

## To find item-tracked items with Find Entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Find Entries**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose **Search for item references**.
3. In the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields, enter the item tracking numbers that you want to trace.  
4. Choose the **Find** action to find all instances of the serial or lot number in the database.

# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and accounts from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information and then open an assisted setup guide to upload the data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
For more information, see [Importing Business Data from Other Finance Systems](across-import-data-configuration-packages.md).

## Data from QuickBooks desktop

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to Business Central:

- Customers  
- Vendors  
- Items  
- Chart of Accounts  
- Beginning Balance transactions in General Ledger  
- On-hand Quantities for Inventory Items  
- Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos and payments  

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:

- The sale of items or services to customers  
- The purchase of items or services from vendors  
- Adjustments in the general ledger  

Business Central requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks.
If transactions in QuickBooks have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in Business Central before you can post transactions.

In order to get your data out of the QuickBooks desktop application you will need to download the Microsoft Data Exporter Tool.  The instructions for the tool are in the Data Migration Wizard in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tool will connect to your QuickBooks application and export the applicable data to a .zip file.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the data exporter tool only works with QuickBooks 2017 and 2018.

## Finding the QuickBooks data migration extension

The QuickBooks Data Migration extension is installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the Data Migration assisted setup guide. If you are ready to get started now, and have exported your data from QuickBooks, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.  

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status Unposted, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the Sales Invoices page. To review payment journals, go to the Payment Journals page.
There are a few things in particular that you should do:
If the transactions in QuickBooks had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in Business Central before you post them.
If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Set up locations

Locations are places such as warehouses where you buy, store, or sell items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses locations to help keep track of inventory in both simple and complex warehouse processes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. To learn more, go to [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fe5ed50e-2e5d-47d4-8616-92ae4639f400]

## Location cards

You specify information about a location, such as a warehouse or distribution center, on the **Location Card** page. You give each location a name and a code that represents the location. You can then enter the location code in other parts of the program when you want to record transactions for a given location.  

You can enter information about bins and warehouse policies for each location. Based on your warehouse policies, you can use the options on the **Bins** FastTab to specify the bins to use by default for transactions. If you're using directed put-away and pick, the options on the **Bin Policies** FastTab let you define how to use advanced warehousing features.  

Some option fields depend on settings in the **Location Card** page to restrict unsupported setup combinations.  

Choose the **Zones** or **Bins** actions to view information about zones and bins that are defined for the location.

### To set up a location

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many fields on the Location Card page are related to the handling of items in inbound and outbound warehouse processes. These fields are not relevant for companies that do not require complex warehouse functionality. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

You can change the configuration of a location as long as it doesn't have item ledger entries.  

If you have multiple locations, you can define transfer routes between locations. To learn more about transfer routes, go to [To create a transfer route](inventory-how-setup-locations.md#to-create-a-transfer-route).

### To create a transfer route

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
4. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. To learn more about transfers, go to [Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

## Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure and can suggest where to put items. Your bins can have contents, or be floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, on the **Location Card** page, on the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle. You can design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in the fields for the warehouse processes on the **Bins** and **Bin Policies** FastTabs.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can specify bin codes on a location, you must create bin codes. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## Zones

If you want to structure your bins under zones, you can do that in the **Zones** page. When you assign a zone to bins, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies information from the zone to the bins. You can also choose to set up one zone and use bins alone to organize your warehouse. To learn more about zones, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Default Dimensions for Locations

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them using various reporting tools. For example, dimensions can indicate the department or project an entry came from. Having default dimensions helps people avoid making mistakes and having to enter dimensions manually on the transaction level if all goods come from a single location and department.

You set default dimensions for a location on the **Location Card** page by choosing **Dimensions**. Afterward, the location's default dimensions are assigned to the following documents when you choose the location on a line.

* Transfer orders
* Physical inventory orders
* Inventory shipments
* Inventory receipts
* Item journals

If needed, you can delete or change the dimension on the line. In the **Value Posting** field, you can require people to specify dimensions for locations before they can post an entry. If you want to allow people to choose only certain dimension values, you can specify the values in the **Allowed Values Filter** field. You can also include location dimension values on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, and for combinations of priority and dimension rules on the **Dimension Combinations** page.

Because transfer order documents and reclassification journals deal with more than one location, the order in which you enter data is important. Default dimensions are copied from the last location field (the in-transit location is ignored).

### Example of default dimensions on locations

The following examples illustrate how the default dimension is used.

You have the following dimension settings:

* Location EAST. Department dimension is ADM
* Location WEST. Department dimension is PROD

You specify the location on a transfer order as follows:

1. From Location = EAST
2. To Location = WEST

The PROD dimension will be copied from location WEST.

You fill in the fields in the opposite order, as follows:

1. To Location = WEST
2. From Location = EAST

The ADM dimension will be copied from location EAST.

# Daily Purchases (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Daily Purchases** report provides a comprehensive overview of your purchase activities on specific days. By highlighting days with a higher volume of purchases, you can identify trends and patterns in your purchasing behavior. You can also use this report to analyze purchase data across different years, quarters, or months, and get valuable insights into purchasing trends over time.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps purchasing managers and purchasing teams to optimize purchasing schedules and track daily purchase activities.

Purchasing managers can analyze data to allocate budgets and staff, ensuring that your team can handle the purchasing volume. Use this report to identify the busiest days of the week and make sure that your team is adequately staffed on those days. For example, the report might show that Wednesdays are your busiest days. You can allocate more staff and budget to ensure that your team can handle the workload.

Purchasers track daily purchases and ensure they stay within budget. Use this report to monitor daily purchase activities and identify purchases or days that might exceed the budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Daily Purchases* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)  
- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)

# Quote an Assemble-to-Order Sale

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

As when you sell any other type of item, you can also create a sales quote for a customized assembly item before converting it to a sales order. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular sales quote, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is an assembly quote.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all types of quotes, the quantities on assembly quotes are not used in availability, planning, or reservations.  

## To create a sales quote for an assemble-to-order item

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quote**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Create a sales quote line with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).  
3.  In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not quote a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the sales quote line.  

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, choose **Assemble to Order**, and then choose **Assemble-to-Order Lines**. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the line.  
5.  On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the quote that the customer is requesting. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket quote order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6.  When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the quote, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Sales Quote** page.  
7.  If the customer accepts the quote, then create a sales order for the quoted assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md). The linked assembly quote and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Set Up Standard Service Codes

When you perform typical service, you often have to create service documents that use service lines that contain similar information. To make it easy to create these lines, you can set up standard service codes that have a predefined set of service lines. When you choose the code on a service document, the lines are entered automatically. You can set up any number of standard service codes, and each code can have an unlimited number of service lines of different types, including item, resource, cost, or standard text linked to it. You create service lines of each standard service code on the **Standard Service Code** card. You then assign standard service codes to service item groups on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page. Later, when you create a service document, you can use the **Get Standard Service Codes** action to add service lines.  
  
> [!Tip]
> You can use the same concept to create lines on sales and purchase documents. For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).  
  
## To set up a standard service code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Service Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.  

## To assign a standard service code to a service item group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If your company uses the Bookings app in Microsoft 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Bookings Not Invoiced** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## Connect to Bookings

To connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information on the **Booking Sync. Setup** page, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings app is designed to book appointments for individual customers rather than companies. The synchronization with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will, therefore, only synchronize customer contacts with a Type of *Person*. An email address is also required for the contact to synchronize.  

Similarly, if you want to synchronize service items between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new service items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the services in our Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only items of type *Service* will synchronize between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The template that you set up in the **Configuration Templates** page so it can be used for the item synchronization must define the type as *Service*.

## Invoice Appointments

When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Bookings Not Invoiced** page. Depending on how often the information is synchronized, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2022, we discovered an issue in the integration with Bookings. Currently, the sync from Bookings to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires you to manually associate the invoices with customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. You can also organize users in user groups. User groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

For more information about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [download the Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

> [!NOTE]
> The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>
> For more information, see the [Authentication and Credential Types](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/users-credential-types) in the administration Help for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.

# Setting up fixed assets

Before you can work with fixed assets (FA), you need to define a few things:  

* How you depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record acquisition costs, depreciations, and other values in the general ledger.  
* Optionally, how to record insurance and maintenance on fixed assets.

The sections in this article link to more information about how to set up fixed assets. After you finish the setup, you can start working with fixed assets. For more information, see [Using Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** pages, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. The help articles for fixed assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page to post transactions for the activity.

## Required setup tasks

The following table contains a sequence of tasks to set up fixed assets, and links to related articles.

# About cost accounting

Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business. Cost accounting information is designed to analyze:  

- What types of costs your business incurs.  
- Where the costs occur.
- Who bears the costs.

In cost accounting, you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations, departments, products, and projects to analyze the profitability of your company.  

## Workflow in cost accounting

Cost accounting has the following main components:  

- Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects  
- Cost entries and cost journals  
- Cost allocations  
- Cost budgets
- Cost reporting  

The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting.  

![Cost Accounting overview.](media/costaccountingoverview.png "CostAccountingOverview")  

## Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects

You define cost types, cost centers, and cost objects to analyze what the costs are, where the costs come from, and who should bear the costs.  

First, you define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts. You can create your own chart of cost types or do so by transferring the general ledger income statement accounts.  

Cost centers are departments and profit centers responsible for costs and income. Often, there are more cost centers set up in cost accounting than in any dimension that is set up in the general ledger. In the general ledger, typically only the first level cost centers for direct costs and the initial costs are used. In cost accounting, more cost centers are created for extra allocation levels.  

Cost objects are products, product groups, or services a company offers. These objects are the "finished goods" that carry the costs.  

You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company. Through the general ledger, you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions and supplement that information with subtotals and titles.  

## Cost entries and cost journals

Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger. You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting. You can also use a batch job to transfer general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting.  

In cost journals, you can post cost and activities that don't come from the general ledger or aren't generated by allocations. For example, you can post pure operational costs, internal charges, allocations, and corrective entries between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects individually, or on a recurring basis.  

## Cost allocations

Allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. Overhead costs are first posted to cost centers and later charged to cost objects. An example would be a sales department that sells several products at the same time. The department's overhead costs, such as salaries, supplies, and travel expenses, are initially assigned to the sales cost center. The costs are then allocated between the different products (cost objects) sold, together with the materials purchased (direct cost).

The allocation base and the accuracy of the allocation definition influence the results of cost allocations. The allocation definition allocates costs first from so-called precost centers to main cost centers, and then from cost centers to cost objects.  

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. You can allocate actual values or budgeted values using the static allocation method based on a definite value. For example, square footage, or an established allocation ratio of 5:2:4. You can also allocate actual values or budgeted values by using the dynamic allocation method with nine predefined allocation bases and 12 dynamic date ranges.  

## Cost budgets

Similar to budgeting in the general ledger, you can create budgets to plan for costs during a certain period (a fiscal year, for example), which can be applied to a cost center (company department), or a cost object (product or service). You can create as many cost budgets as you need. You can then copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa. And you can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs.

## Cost reporting

Most reports and statistics are based on the posted cost entries. You can set the sorting of the results and use filters to define which data must be displayed. You can create reports for cost distribution analysis. In addition, you can use the standard financial reports to define how your reports for the chart of cost types are displayed.

# Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment

To let people work in their preferred language, the user interface (UI) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is translated by apps that Microsoft provides, or by language apps that our partners provide on AppSource. Administrators install the language apps in their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Afterward, on the **My Settings** page, people can choose the language in which they want to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Languages** page lists all languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. However, to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a selected language, the language app must be installed in the environment. If someone chooses a language that a language app isn't installed for, they might be confused when the UI doesn't change.

To avoid confusion and make it easier for people to select a language they can use, administrators can use the **Allowed Languages** page to list the languages that they installed language apps for. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the list of languages on the **My Settings** page to show only the allowed languages.

## Create a list of allowed languages

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allowed Languages**, and choose the related link.
1. In the **Language ID** field, choose the language to allow.
1. Repeat step 2 for each language that you installed a language app for.

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

* Assemble to order  
* Assemble to stock  

## Assemble to order

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. For example, for the following reasons:

* You'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* You want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

The following list describes some of the benefits of the assemble-to-order process:  

* Customize assembly items when taking a sales order.  
* Overview availability of the assembly item and its components.  
* Reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment.  
* Determine the profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost.  
* Integrated with the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier.  
* Assemble to order when you create a sales quote or a blanket sales order.  
* Combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities.  

In the assemble-to-order process, you assemble items for a sales order. There's a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order.  

When you enter an assemble-to-order item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created. The assembly order is based on the sales line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly BOM. The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. The delivery date is based on the availability of components. To learn more about assembling items for sales orders, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can sell inventory quantities and assemble-to-order quantities on the same sales order. To learn more about combining stock and assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-order, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Order**.  

## Assemble to stock

Use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. Assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. You can also consume these items as subassembly components. The items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. To learn more about assembly items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

When you specify an assemble-to-stock item on a sales line, the item is treated like any other item sold from inventory. For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks availability only for the assembled item only, and not its components.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can assemble an item to order even if the item is set up to be assembled to stock. Learn more at [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-stock, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Stock**.  

## Combination scenarios

When assemble-to-order and inventory quantities are combined on a sales order, assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped first.  

If an assembly order is linked to a sales order line, the value in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field via the **Quantity** field on the assembly order. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is related to the **Qty. to Ship** field on the sales order line. This relation manages how you ship partial and complete assemble-to-order quantities:

* When the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order
* In combination scenarios where part of the quantity is assembled to order and part is shipped from inventory.

The combination scenario allows flexibility for partial shipments. You can use the **Quantity to Assemble** field to specify the quantity to ship partially from inventory and by assembling to order.  

If the full sales line quantity must be assembled to order and shipped, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the linked assembly order when you change the quantity to ship. This update ensures that the quantity being shipped is fully supplied by the assemble-to-order quantity.  

However, in combination scenarios, the full value in the **Qty. to Ship** is not copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the assembly order. Instead, a default value is inserted in the **Quantity to Assemble** field. The value is calculated from the **Qty. to Ship** field to ensure the assemble-to-order quantities ship first.

To deviate from the default, for example because you only want to assemble more or less of the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field within predefined rules, as illustrated below.  

An example of why you would modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post the shipment of inventory quantities before you ship the assembly output.  

The following tables explain the rules that define the minimum and maximum values that you can enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field to deviate from the default value in a combination scenario. The table shows a combination scenario where the **Qty. to Ship** field on the linked sales order line is changed from 7 to 4, and the **Quantity to Assemble** is therefore defaulted to 4.  

**Sales Order Line**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 10          | 7                | 7                             | 0                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4                |                               |                      |

**Assembly Order Header**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 7           | 7                | 0                             | 7                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4 (inserted by default)|                         |                      |

Based on this example, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field as follows:  

* The minimum quantity you can enter is 1. You must assemble at least one unit to be able to sell the four units, assuming that the remaining three are available in inventory.  
* The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4. This limit ensures that you don't assemble more of the item than you need for the sale.

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

# Manage and reconcile your bank accounts

A bank reconciliation should be completed at regular intervals for all your bank accounts to ensure that the company's cash records are correct. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

You can perform the task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page where you match (reconcile) bank statement lines in the left-hand pane with your internal bank account ledger entries in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page as part of processing the payments that are represented on a bank statement. On both pages, you can fill in the bank statement information by importing a file or feed and you can use automatic matching suggestions.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the North American versions, you can also perform bank reconciliation on the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, deselect the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

Before you can manage your bank accounts within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up each bank account as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Setting Up Banking](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

| Reconcile bank accounts in connection with payment processing on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. |[Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Use bank reconciliation to help verify that your books are up-to-date, and do not post the reconciliation until you are satisfied with the reconciliation.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls which objects a user can access within each database or environment, in combination with the user's license. For each user you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. For more information, see [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and user groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Starting in 2022 release wave 1, admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]  
For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> An broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You do this through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> In 2022 release wave 2 we made it easier to add permissions to permission sets. Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

Maintenance is also easier. When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set will be automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

  To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|Ranking|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
  |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
  |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
  To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
  |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
  |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If a permission is in a permission set that is included, and is also in a permission set that is excluded, the permission will be excluded.

6. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

  > [!TIP]
  > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

7. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. For more information, see [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
8. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you've added, choose the set on the Result pane and the **Included permissions** FactBox will show the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you've excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's been excluded, the status will be **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you've excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you've added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, Insert Permission, Modify Permission, and so on, will all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
2. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
3. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set will include all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions are not organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
2. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
3. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
4. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

    Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
3. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.  
    Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
6. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
7. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
8. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
9. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multi-tenant environments, a permission set will be imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

    An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

2. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
3. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

    If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file will be merged with the imported permission sets.

    If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file will be skipped during import. In that case, you'll be notified about permission sets that are skipped.

4. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. For more information, see [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you may need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. To support this scenario, when you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you have the option to select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

Learn how at [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Manage permissions through user groups

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

### To add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To create user groups automatically, see [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#to-copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

### To copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members are not copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll get a validation error if you're trying to assign a user group to the user that refers to a permission set which was defined in an uninstalled extension. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever it's referenced. To assign that user group to a user, you can either re-install the extension, remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set, or remove that permission set from the user group.

### To assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

### To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that are added by Microsoft or by your solution provider. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. For more information, see the [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called SUPER to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, set the **Company** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the relevant user.
3. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

    The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

    The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

    For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
    >
    > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a non-entitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement will be surrounded by brackets to indicate that it is not effective as it is overruled by the entitlement.
    >
    > For an explanation of ranking, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

4. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.

5. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes will also apply to other users that have the permission set assigned.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. For more information, see [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.


## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Export data for auditing

Export of bookkeeping information from the system is a common request by some local authorities or auditors. Exports of formats and required information can differ. Entries for export are usually General ledger (G/L) entries or value-added tax (VAT) entries. However, other information is sometimes required.

**Audit Files Export** is a preinstalled extension that lets you export different entries, based on auditor or authority requirements. Regardless of the format type or entries, you can use the extension's functionality to control the data export process. The functionality doesn't have a preinstalled file format for export. Therefore, you must either install an app that has a specific format (for example, SIE, SAF-T, or FAC) or develop your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can select SIE (Sweden), FEC (France), and SAF-T format as an additional app. Partners can also develop a custom format. The number of available formats will increase over time.

## Set up audit file export

1. Select the search button ![Magnifying glass button that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **Audit File Export Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Audit File Export Setup** page, follow these steps:

    1. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Audit File Export Format Code** field, specify the code for the default audit file export format. Only those formats that were enabled when a specific file format was installed from Feature management and those that were added as a custom format are available.
    2. On the **Data Quality** FastTab, select the **Check Company Information** checkbox to be notified about company information fields that haven't been set up correctly.
    3. Select the **Check Customer** checkbox to be notified about fields that haven't been set up correctly for specific customers.
    4. Select the **Check Vendor** checkbox to be notified about fields that haven't been set up correctly for specific vendors.
    5. Select the **Check Bank Account** checkbox to be notified about fields that haven't been set up correctly for specific bank accounts.
    6. Select the **Check ZIP Code** checkbox to be notified about a postal code that hasn't been set up correctly.
    7. Select the **Check Address** checkbox to be notified when an address hasn't been set up correctly.
    8. In the **Default ZIP Code** field, enter the postal code to use if no postal code is specified on the customer or vendor card.

3. Select the search button ![Magnifying glass button that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **Audit File Export Format Setup**, and then select the related link.
4. On the **Audit File Export Format Setup** page, follow these steps:

    1. Select the audit file export format that you want to configure. Only those formats that were enabled when a specific file format was installed from Feature management and those that were added as a custom format are available.
    2. In the **Audit File Name** field, specify the default file name or the file name template for the audit file that you want to export.
    3. Select the **Archive to Zip** checkbox to automatically zip exported files.

## Provide the G/L account mapping for audit file export

Most formats that are required by authorities for G/L accounts require a specific standard chart of accounts. Therefore, after you configure your G/L accounts, your exported file will be based on the mappings. You can use more mappings in your system.

Follow these steps to provide the G/L account mapping for audit file export.

1. Select the search button ![Magnifying glass button that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **G/L Account mapping**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **G/L Account Mapping** page, select **New** to create a mapping.
3. In the **Code** field, specify the mapping code that represents the reporting period.
4. In the **Standard Account Type** field, select the type of standard G/L accounts.
5. In the **Audit File Export Format** field, specify the audit file export format that the standard G/L accounts are linked to.
6. In the **Period Type** field, the system specifies an accounting period or a custom period type that has a flexible start date and time, based on your selection. If you select a specific accounting period, the field will be set to **Accounting Period**. Otherwise, it will be set to **Data Range**.
7. In the **Accounting Period** field, specify the start date of the accounting period that will be used as the reporting period, if you want them to be the same.
8. If you set the **Accounting Period** field, the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields are automatically set, based on the period that you specified. Otherwise, you can manually set the start and end dates for your reporting.
9. If you've already added a standard chart of accounts, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Standard Account Category No.** field, specify the category of the standard account or grouping code that's used for mapping.
    2. In the **Standard Account No.** field, specify the standard account code or grouping code that's used for mapping.

10. Select the **Include Incoming Balance** checkbox to consider the incoming balance of the G/L account of the **Balance Account** type for mapping instead of the reporting period's net change.
11. To start the mapping, follow these steps:

    1. To generate lines on the **G/L Account Mapping** page, based on an existing chart of accounts, select **Initialize Source for Mapping**. To copy the G/L account mapping from some another mapping code, select **Copy from Another Mapping**. When you've finished creating lines, all G/L accounts that have posted entries will be marked in green.
    2. To mark only G/L accounts that have entries, select **Update G/L Entry Availability**. If the **Include Incoming Balance** option is enabled, all posted G/L entries are considered for calculation. Otherwise, only G/L entries of the reporting period are considered.

## Export the audit file

1. Select the search button ![Magnifying glass button that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **Audit File Export Documents**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Audit File Export Documents** page, select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Audit File Export Format** field, select the format that's used to export the audit file.
    2. In the **G/L Account Mapping Code** field, select the G/L account mapping code for the reporting period.
    3. Select the **Split By Month** checkbox if multiple audit files should be generated per month.
    4. Select the **Split By Date** checkbox if multiple audit files should be generated per day.
    5. In the **Header Comment** field, enter the comment to include on the audit file header.
    6. In the **Contact** field, specify the contact that's exported to the header of the audit file.
    7. Select the **Create Multiple Zip Files** checkbox to generate multiple zip files.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Select this checkbox only if you previously installed some of the format apps or created a custom one. Installation of one or more of the specific formats will likely add fields and functions to the **Audit Files Export** functionality, based on the format requirements.

4. On the **Processing** FastTab, follow these steps:

    1. Select the **Parallel Processing** checkbox if you want audit file generation to be processed by parallel background jobs. Clear the checkbox to export data in your current session.
    2. If you selected the **Parallel Processing** checkbox, in the **Max No. Of Jobs** field, specify the maximum number of background jobs that can be run at the same time.
    3. In the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field, specify the earliest date and time when the background job must be run. If you run the process by selecting **Start**, you can track the status on the **Processing** and **Lines** FastTabs.

5. When you've finished, select **Download as File** to download the audit file for the selected line.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have multiple entries to export, we don't recommend that you export them in the current session, because of possible performance issues. Instead, we recommend that you use parallel processing during non-working days or hours.

# Set up information for contacts

When you create contacts you can enter information about them, such as:

- The industry the contact belongs to.
- Your business relationship with them.

Before you create contacts and record details about your business relationships, you must set up some of the information that you assign to them. For example:

- Mailing groups
- Industry groups
- Business relations
- Web sources
- Organizational levels
- Job responsibilities

You can set up this information on their pages, or from the Contact Card page by choosing the **New** action in the drop-down menu for the fields.  

This information helps you organize your contacts so they're easier to find when you want to communicate with them. For example, you can find all contacts based on a certain group.

## To assign industry groups to a contact

Industry groups indicate the type of industry that your contacts are in. For example, the retail industry or the automobile industry.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign industry groups to contacts of type **Company**.

The industry group code defines the type or category of the group, such as ADVERT for advertising, or PRESS, for TV and radio. You can have several industry group codes. Define industry groups on the **Industry Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Company** action, and then the **Industry Groups** action. The **Contact Industry Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Industry Groups Code** field, select the industry groups you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many industry groups as you want. You can also assign industry groups from the contact list by following the same procedure.

<!--The number of industry groups that you assigned to the contact displays in the **No. of Industry Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page. -->

After you assign industry groups to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign mailing groups to a contact

You can use mailing groups to identify groups of contacts that you want to send the same information to. For example, you can set up a mailing group for the contacts that you want to notify about an office move, or a group for sending holiday gifts.

The mailing group code defines the type or category of the group, such as MOVE for office move, or GIFT for holiday gift. You can have several mailing group codes. Define mailing groups on the **Mailing Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Mailing Groups** action. The **Contact Mailing Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Mailing Groups Code** field, select the mailing group that you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many mailing groups as you want. You can also assign mailing groups from the contact list.

<!--The number of mailing groups you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Mailing Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page.-->

After you assign mailing groups to your contacts, you can use the information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Define an alternate address for a contact

You can assign an alternate address where your contact sometimes wants to receive mail and information. For example, their vacation home. You can also assign date ranges that specify when to use each alternate address.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Card** action.

    To define that the alternate address applies in a specific period, choose the **Date Range** action instead.
3. On the **Contact Alt. Address List** page, enter a new alternate address and fill in the fields on the **Contact Alternative Address** page.

Repeat these steps to assign as many alternate addresses as you want. You can specify one or more date ranges for each alternate address.

## Assign job responsibilities to a contact

You can add information about the job responsibilities of contact persons to indicate what the contact person is responsible for. For example, IT, management, or production.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only specify job responsibilities for contacts of the type **Person**.

The job responsibility code defines the type or category of the job, such a MARKETING or PURCHASE. You can have several job responsibility codes. Define job responsibilities on the **Job Responsibilities** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Job Responsibilities** action. The **Contact Job Responsibilities** page opens.
3. In the **Job Responsibility Code** field, select the job responsibility.

Repeat these steps to assign as many job responsibilities as you want. You can also assign job responsibilities from the contact list.

<!--The number of job responsibilities you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Job Responsibilities** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign organizational levels to a contact

You can use organizational levels on your contacts to specify where they are in their company. For example, top management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign organizational levels to contacts of the type **Person**.

The organizational level code defines the type or category of the organizational level, such a CEO or CFO. You can have several organizational level codes. Define organizational levels on the **Organizational Levels** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. In the **Organizational Levels** field, select the code you want to assign.

After you assign organizational levels to your contacts, you can use this information to create segments.

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign web sources to a contact

You can use web sources with your contact companies to identify, for example, web sites that you want to use to search for information about the contacts. When assigning web sources, you specify which search engine and search word to use to find the requested information.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign web sources to contacts of the type **Company**.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Web Sources** action. The **Contact Web Sources** page opens.
3. In the **Web Source Code** field, choose the web source you want to assign.
4. In the **Search Word** field, enter the search word that you want to use to find the information.

Repeat these steps to assign as many web sources as you want.

## Assign business relations to a contact

Business relations indicate the business relationship you have with your contacts. For example, a prospect, bank, consultant, service supplier, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign business relations to contacts of the type **Company**.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.
3. On the **Contact Business Relations** page, in the **Business Relation Code** field, select the business relation you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many business relations as you want.

<!--The number of business relations you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Business Relations** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign business relations to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Copy information from contact companies to contact persons

Some information about contact companies is the same for their contact persons. For example, the address details. On the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can specify which fields on the contact card for a company is copied to the contact card for a person each time you create a contact person for the contact company.

When you change the value in one of these fields on the contact company card, the same fields on the contact person card update. The exception is if you manually changed the field on the contact person card.

To learn more, go to [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use predefined default settings on new contacts

You can use the **Defaults** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify default values that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns to new contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The settings for inheritance overwrite the default values you set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns German as the language code for the contact persons for that company.

## Synchronize contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts

To synchronize the contact card with a linked customer, vendor, or bank account, fill in the relevant field in the **Bus. Relation Code for** section on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.  

To learn more, go to [Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

## Search for duplicate contacts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact. Or, you can search manually after you create a contact. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the search strings automatically each time you change a contact's information or create a contact. You can specify the **Search Hit %**, that is, the percentage of identical strings that two contacts must have to consider them as duplicates. You enter the percentage on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.

When you find a duplicate contact, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page to merge it with a contact record that you want to keep. To learn more, go to [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md).

# Get the Business Central add-in for Outlook

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in [!INCLUDE [outlook-name](includes/outlook-name.md)]. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] add-in, you can view financial data related to customers and vendors. You can also create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

There are two ways to get the Business Central add-in for Outlook installed, depending on your role in the organization:

- As a Microsoft 365 administrator, use *Centralized Deployment* to install the add-in automatically for the entire organization, groups, or specific users.

- As any user, install the add-in for your own use if not already done by your admin.

## About the Business Central add-in for Outlook

The Business Central add-in for Outlook consists of two smaller add-ins:

- Contact insights

    This add-in provides users with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also enables you to create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such sales quotes and invoices to a contact. <!--To support these task, the add-in adds actions to the Outlook ribbon, in the **Business Central** group. --> 

- Document view

    When an email refers to a business document number in the email body, this add-in provides a direct, in-line link from email body to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For more information about what you do with the add-ins, see [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

Each add-in is provided as an XML file, called a *manifest*, which must be installed in Outlook of anyone who wants this functionality. These files describe how to activate the add-ins and connect to Business Central when they're used in Outlook. Working with these files is typically done by an admin. As a user, in most cases, you won't have to handle with these files directly. Either your admin will set up the add-in to install automatically for you or you'll use the built-in assisted setup to handle the installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Working with multiple environments? The Business Central add-in for Outlook is designed to work with a single Business Central environment. When the add-in is installed, the name of the environment is included in the add-in's manifest. This configuration means that the add-in will only connect to the environment that it was installed from. To use the add-in with a different environment, you'll open the environment and install the add-in again.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment as an admin

Centralized Deployment is a feature in Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Outlook. It's the recommended way for admins to deploy for Office add-ins to users and groups within your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For Business Central on-premises, see [Setting Up the Add-In for Outlook Integration with Business Central On-Premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/setting-up-office-add-ins-outlook-inbox) in the administration content (English only).

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 subscription  
- Users are assigned a Microsoft 365 license  
- Your Microsoft 365 account has at least the [Exchange Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#exchange-administrator) role

### Deploy the add-in

1. In Business Central, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **Outlook Add-in Centralized Deployment** to start the assisted setup guide.
1. Review the first page and select **Next** to open the page for downloading the add-ins.
1. In the **Deploy** column, select the check box for the add-ins that you want to deploy, then select **Download and Continue**.

    A file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device.

1. At this point, you're finished with the work you need to do in Business Central, so you can select **Done**.

   >[!TIP]
   > Before you select **Next**, select the **Go to Microsoft 365 (opens in a new window)** link to open and sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a new browser window. You'll have to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a later step anyways.

1. Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** files from the .zip to a folder of your choice.

    For more information, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, then go to [Integrated Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967).

1. Select **Upload custom apps**.
1. On the **Upload Apps to deploy** page, set **App type** to **Office Add-in**.
1. Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device** > **Choose file**.
1. Choose one of the add-in files **Context Insights.xml** or **Documents.xml** that you extracted earlier.
1. Follow the instructions to assign users and deploy the add-in.
1. Repeat step 9 through 11 for the other add-in file if you want.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A green check mark appears when the add-in is deployed to the admin center. However, it can take up to 24 hours before users see the add-in in the [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] app. Users might have to restart Outlook as well.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-do-you-target-add-in-user-assignments-with-centralized-deployment-&preserve-view=true).

## <a name="install"></a>Install the add-in for your own use

If your organization allows it, you can install the Business Central add-in for just yourself. Contact your administrator if you're not sure.

1. In Business Central, go to the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Get the Outlook Add-in**, and then select the related link.

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::

|Select...|To...|See more info...|
|---------|-----|----------------|
|Open in OneDrive|Copy the file to a Business Central folder in your OneDrive and open the file.|[Open in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#open-in-onedrive) |
|Share|Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.|[Share in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#share) |

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts

You can rate a prospect so you can identify the ideal prospects to focus your sales campaign on. You can set up profile questionnaires that you want to use when entering information about your contacts' profiles. Within each questionnaire, you can set up the different questions you intend to ask your contacts. This way, you can group contacts so that your campaigns are more likely to target the right people based on the criteria that you define with the questionnaires.  

With the right questionnaires, you can rate your prospects and group them into categories. You can use existing questions and answers and combine them with new questions and answers to form the basis of your rating. Each answer in the rating is given a point value and, depending on the range you set up for the categories (*From Value* and *To Value*), the rating system will group your contacts in the categories you have defined. For example, *ABC* customers, *High/Low loyalty* vendors, or *Platinum/Gold/Silver* prospects.  

You can also run the questionnaire to answer some of the questions based on contact, customer, or vendor data automatically.  

## To add a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Questionnaire Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** Action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To add questions to a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the relevant profile questionnaire, and then choose the **Edit Questionnaire Setup** action.  
2. On the first empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Question** and type your question in the **Description** field. Fill in the other fields on this line.  

    Optionally, add details to the question.

    1. Choose the line with the question, and then, choose the **Line** menu, and then choose **Question Details**.  

    2. On the **Classification** FastTab in the **Profile Question Details** page, select the **Auto Contact Classification** field.  

    3. In the **Contact Class. Field** field, select the **Rating** option.  

    4. Fill in the **Min. % Questions Answered** field. The default is **0**.  

        This specifies the number of questions in percentage that must be answered for this rating to be calculated.

    5. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Page** group, choose **Answer Points**. Enter the points you want to give each answer listed in the **Answer Points** page.

        If you want to get an overview of the points you have given each answer, choose the **Answer Points** action.

    6. To run an update, return to the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page. On the **Actions** menu, in the **Functions** group, choose **Update Classification**.

    In the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page, the number of contacts that meets this criteria is displayed in the **No. of Contacts** field, as well as on the **Contact Card** of each contact.

3. On the next empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Answer** and type your answer in the **Description** field.  
4. In the **Priority** field, select the priority. In the **From Value** and **To Value** fields, define a point range. Contacts that receive points within the defined range will get the answer.  

Repeat these steps to enter all the questions and answers within the profile questionnaire.

After you have created a questionnaire, you can use it to rate and classify your contacts. You can also set up questions that are rated automatically based on information in the contact card.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you enter a question that is automatically answered, choose **Line**, and then choose **Question Details**, to enter the criteria to automatically answer the question.

## Apply questionnaires to contacts

You can apply your questionnaires to contacts manually. Just open the relevant contact card, and then choose the **Profile** action. Then, once you have applied the questionnaires that you want to apply, you can start using the categories in your campaigns.  

## The Automatic Classification of Contacts

You can automatically classify your contacts according to customer, vendor, and contact information, by setting up automatically answered profile questions on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts that are recorded as customers can be assigned a classification based on customer data and only contacts that are recorded as vendors can be assigned a classification based on vendor data. The automatic classification is not updated automatically. Consequently, you may want to update the profile questionnaires, after you have updated the customer, vendor or contact data they are based on.  

After you have set up automatically answered profile questions, if you assign the profile questionnaire containing these questions to a contact, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically assign the right answers for the contact.  

## Example

You can classify your contacts according to how much they bought from you:

|Answer|Applies to|
|--- |--- |
|A|contacts who bought for 500,000 LCY or more|
|B|contacts who bought for 100,000 up to 499,999 LCY|
|C|contacts who bought for 99,999 LCY or less|

To do this, fill on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page as follows:

| Type     | Description        | Automatic Classification     | From Value | To Value |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Question | ABC Classification | Click to insert a check mark |            |          |
| Answer   | A                  |                              | 500,000    |          |
| Answer   | B                  |                              | 100,000    | 499,999  |
| Answer   | C                  |                              |            | 99,999   |

Then fill on the **Profile Question Details** page as follows:

| Field                         | Value         |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Customer Classification Field | Sales (LCY)   |
| Classification Method         | Defined Value |

When you assign the profile questionnaire containing this question to a contact, application automatically enters the relevant answer for this contact on the profile lines of the contact card.

# Design Details: Variance
Variance is defined as the difference between the actual cost and the standard cost, as described in the following formula.  

 actual cost – standard cost = variance  

 If the actual cost changes, for example, because you post an item charge on a later date, then the variance is updated accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Revaluation does not affect the variance calculation, because revaluation only changes the inventory value.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how variance is calculated for purchased items. It is based on the following scenario:  

1.  The user purchases an item at LCY 90.00, but the standard cost is LCY 100.00. Accordingly, the purchase variance is LCY –10.00.  
2.  LCY 10.00 is credited to the purchase variance account.  
3.  The user posts an item charge of LCY 20.00. Accordingly, the actual cost is increased to LCY 110.00, and the value of the purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
4.  LCY 20.00 is debited to the purchase variance account. Accordingly, the net purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
5.  The user revalues the item from LCY 100.00 to LCY 70.00. This does not affect the variance calculation, only the inventory value.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

 ![Purchase variance calculation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_11_purchase_variance.png "Purchase variance calculation")  

## Determining the Standard Cost  
 The standard cost is used when calculating variance and the amount to capitalize. Since the standard cost can be changed over time because of manual update calculation, you need a point in time when the standard cost is fixed for variance calculation. This point is when the inventory increase is invoiced. For produced or assembled items, the point when standard cost is determined is when the cost is adjusted.  

 The following table shows how different cost shares are calculated for produced and assembled items when you use the Calculate Standard Cost function.  

|Cost Share|Purchased Item|Produced/Assembled Item|  
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|

# Use time sheets

This article describes how to use time sheets to track absence, and to track time and resources that are spent on a project. Tracking time helps you identify issues early and avoid delays or cost overruns. Time sheets make it easy for a resource to report time usage for an individual or a machine so that managers can review the usage and its allocation.

You can copy and use your project planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct. To learn more, go to [To copy project planning lines to a time sheet](#copy-project-planning-lines-to-a-time-sheet).

After you approve time sheet entries for a project, you can post them to the relevant project journal or resource journal. To learn more, go to [To post time sheet lines in a project journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-project-journal) and [To post time sheet lines in a resource journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-resource-journal).

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. To learn more about setting up time sheets, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use time sheets on a mobile device. To do that, you might have to turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** toggle on the [Resources Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=462) page.

## Create time sheets

You can use the **Create Time Sheets** page to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. Then, the time sheet owner can open it and record time that has been spent on a task. You can also [schedule the batch job to run automatically](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permissions to create time sheets. To learn more about permissions, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the **Create Time Sheets** action on the **Resources** list page and the **Resource Card** page.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Before you create time sheets for a resource, make sure that the **Use Time Sheet** and **Time Sheet Owner User ID** fields are specified for them on the **Resource Card** page.

    Optionally, choose the **Schedule** action to specify how often to automatically run the task. For example, to configure the task to run weekly for four weeks, on the **Schedule a Report - Create Time Sheets** page, in the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter **4W**. To learn more about how to schedule reports, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

You can view the time sheets that you create on the **Time Sheets** page. Each time sheet consists of one or more lines that define the time that you want to submit for approval. The following table describes the types of lines that you can add to the time sheet.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| | Use to add a note or marker in the **Description** field of the time sheet line. For example, you can use this field to categorize time sheet entries. If you leave the **Type** field empty for a time sheet line, you can't enter time values in the weekday fields for that line. |
| Absence | Use to register the time you're absent during a work week. To complete the information for the line, specify the type of absence in the **Cause of Absence Code** field. |
| Assembly Order | Used to register time for assembly orders. A time sheet line of this type is created while posting assembly order lines for which the resource is set up to use time sheets. You can't manually select a line of this type. |
| Project | Use to register time usage for a project. To complete the information for the line, specify the project number and the project task number for which you want to register time. You can register time for lines that you haven't scheduled.|
| Resource | Use to register time usage for a resource. To complete the information for the line, provide a description of the work. |
| Service | Use to register time usage for a service order or service credit memo. |

For example, you want to submit a time sheet for a week where you did cleaning tasks and had a day off for a medical appointment. The following table shows how you would add lines to the time sheet.

| Type | Description | Work Type Code | Absence Type Code |
|--|--|--|--|
| Resource | Work hours | Cleaning |  |
| Absence | Time off |  | Health |
|  | I had to take off Tuesday due to a medical appointment. |  |  |

In this hypothetical example, you can then register the hours across the relevant days for each weekday.  

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, your company will have predefined work types for the various types of lines. In those cases, you just choose the relevant work type from the list, and then you add your own description.  
>
> Choose the work type by choosing the :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Description** field, by choosing the **Activity Details** action and then specifying it in the page that opens, or by choosing it in the **Work Type Code** field or the **Absence Type Code** field, respectively. In this case, you can ignore the [To define work types and add one to a time sheet](#define-work-types-and-add-one-to-a-time-sheet) section.  

## Reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets

If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, copy the lines from the previous time period to save time. Then, just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.  
3. Choose the **Copy Lines from Previous Time Sheet** action.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a project, the **Project No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can now modify the lines as needed.

## Copy project planning lines to a time sheet

The following procedure describes how to quickly add project planning lines to a time sheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Time Sheets** page, select a time sheet for the relevant time period.  
3. Choose the **Create lines from project planning** action. Any project planning lines in the time sheet time period are copied to the time sheet for the person or machine in the **Resource No.** field on the time sheet.

## Define work types and add one to a time sheet

You can define the work type for all-time sheet lines for service orders, project orders, and resources. In this way, you can add information that you need to bill the customer for different types of work.  

1. On the **Time Sheets** page, choose the relevant time sheet.
2. On the first of the lines in the **Lines** section, choose the **Type** field, and then choose the relevant type, such as *Resource*.  
3. Choose the **Description** field, and then, in the **Time Sheet Line Resource Detail** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
    1. If no work types exist, choose the **New** action.
    2. On the **Work Types** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then return to the time sheet.
4. Fill in the rest of the time sheet. For more information, see the [To fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval](#fill-in-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval) section.  

> [!TIP]
> You can follow similar steps to define absence codes.

## Fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval

Time sheet registration is tracked in hours, the standard base unit of measure for resources. By default, a time sheet shows the common work days of Monday through Friday.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a time sheet for the relevant period.
3. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary. Enter the number of hours used by the resource on each day of the week.  

    In most cases, to track work, you add a line of type *Resource*, and then register hours spent each day. If you want to register absence, add a line of type *Absence*.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can review the sum of time sheet hours entered in the **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBox.  
4. Repeat step 3 for other work types that the resource performs.  

    Next, decide whether to submit all, or selected, lines on the time sheet.  

    * To submit the time sheet for one or more lines, choose the relevant line, and then choose the **Submit** action.

        On the submission page, choose the **Selected lines only** option. The state of the line changes from **Open** to **Submitted**.
    * To submit the time sheet for all open lines, choose the **Submit** action at the top of the **Time Sheet** page.  

        Confirm that you want to submit all open lines on the current time sheet.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only submit time sheet lines for which you have entered time.  
5. To modify information on a line that has been set to **Submitted**, select the line, and then choose the **Reopen** action.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A manager might reject a time sheet line that is submitted for approval. If a line has the status **Rejected**, you can make changes to the line, and then choose **Submit** again.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

## Approve or reject a time sheet

A time sheet must be submitted for approval before it can be used. You can approve and reject individual lines on a time sheet or send them back to the submitter. You approve a time sheet in two ways:

* A time sheet administrator can approve any time sheet.
* The person who is specified in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on a resource card can approve that resource's time sheets. To learn more about setting up approval, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a time sheet from the list.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page: 
    1. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Approve** action.
    2. Choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Reject** action and follow steps 4 through 5.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Time Sheet Status** and **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBoxes to get an overview of time sheet information.

After you approve or reject a time sheet, it can't be modified unless it's first reopened. The following procedure explains how to reopen an approved or rejected time sheet.

## Reopen a time sheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets** or **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a time sheet from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only reopen lines with the status **Approved**. You can't reopen lines with the status **Rejected** or that are posted.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page, choose the **Reopen** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to reopen all lines, or the **Selected lines only** action to reopen only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The status of the time sheets line or lines is changes to **Submitted**.  

## View and approve time sheets by project

On a project, you can specify a person who is responsible for the project. That information is linked to time sheet lines. The link gives project managers a list of the time sheets to approve. For example, the team's project manager might be responsible for certain projects in your company. In that case, the manager should be designated as the **Person Responsible** on the Project Card page. This view of time sheet information shows the project tasks associated with a project and the quantity of hours used.

> [!NOTE]
> To approve time sheets on the **Manager Time Sheet by Project** page, you must first select a **Time Sheet by Project Approval** option in the **Resources Setup** page. To learn how to set up approvals for resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).

### Approve or reject a time sheet by project

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Manager Time Sheet by Project**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a list of time sheet lines associated with the projects for which you're responsible.
2. Choose the **Approve** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only approve time sheets with the status of **Submitted**.

3. To provide additional information about the approval or rejection, select the **Related** action, then **Comments**, and then **Line Comments**.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]
> After you approve or reject a time sheet line by project, you can't reopen or modify it on the **Time Sheet** page.

## Post time sheet lines in a resource journal

# Update standard costs
You must periodically update the standard costs of components and roll the new costs up to the parent item. The process typically consists of the following four steps:  

1.  Update costs at the component and capacity levels. For more information, see the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
2.  Consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total manufacturing or assembly cost of the items.  
3.  Implement the standard costs that are entered when you run the previous batch jobs. The standard costs don't take effect until they're implemented. Use the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job, which updates the changes in the standard cost on items with the ones in the Standard Cost Worksheet table.  
4.  Implement the changes to update the **Unit Cost** field on the item card and perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).  

For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).
  
## To update standard costs

1.  Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2.  Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:

    1.  Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3.  Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7.  Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4.  Review and post the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|
|Posted documents|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|Posted direct transfer|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|
|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Post transactions directly to the general ledger

You use general journals to post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts.  

A typical use of the general journal is to post employees expenses during business activities for reimbursement. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employee Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

General journals post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts. Entries are created even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group. You can personalize your version of a general journal by setting up a journal batch or template. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

Entries that you post with documents require a credit memo process. However, you can reverse entries that you post with the general journal. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

## To post a transaction directly to a general ledger account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all transactions that you want to post.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple transaction lines before a balance-account line, for example for one bank account, select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. The **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the transactions.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the transactions on the specified G/L accounts.

# Reverse Output Posting

There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## To reverse an output posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3. In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.

# Set Up Online Maps

When you plan a visit to an address saved on a card, such as a customer, you can get a map from an online service with route directions described in the language you select. To make sure this online map service finds the right map and directions, you need to set it up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the online map feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Online Map Setup**,  then choose the related link.
2. On the **Online Map Setup** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

### Customize the online map provider features

To customize the online map feature beyond the options listed on the **Online Map Setup** page, or to use a different map provider, follow these steps:

1. On the **Online Map Setup** page, choose the **Parameter Setup** action.
2. On the **Online Map Parameter Setup** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields to customize how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will generate the URLs for the available services. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
   * Refer to the **Online Map Substitution Parameter** list on the **FactBox** pane for the data available to generate URLs.

# Set up payment terms

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. You can use date formulas to define the payment terms. When you first sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.  

If you assign payment terms to customers and vendors, the same terms are always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. The document dates on sales and purchase documents, not their posting dates, are used to calculate due dates for payments. If needed, you can change the terms on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want a particular customer to pay you within seven days rather than the default 14 days. Changing the terms on the document doesn't change the default payment term assigned to the customer. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents.

When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the payment discounts based on the payment terms. The payment discount date is the last date that the customer can receive a discount. The date is also calculated when you post an invoice.  

Similarly, when you post a credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates payment discounts based on the payment terms. It calculates the discount on credit memos in the same way as discounts on invoices. When you apply a credit memo to an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the discount amount for the invoice by the credit memo's discount amount.  

If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you must set up reminder levels and terms. To learn more about reminders, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).  

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.  

> [!TIP]
> In the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], payment terms don't support partial payments. Instead, you must use the prepayments functionality. To learn more about prepayments, go to [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).
>
> In some countries/regions, you *can* set up payment terms with partial payments. To learn whether your country/region supports this capability, go to the **Local Functionality** section in the table of contents on the left side of a [Microsoft Learn](about-localization.md) article.

## Audit changes to payment terms

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment terms setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for payment terms and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Payment Terms    | 3 |
