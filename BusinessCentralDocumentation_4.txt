# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Workflows in Business Central

You can set up and use workflows to connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows. System tasks can be preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports these types of workflows:
  
* Power Automate flows

  * Automated flows that are triggered by events (such as record or document creation, modification, or deletion) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also included are approval flows created in Power Automate that trigger when an approval is requested in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  * Instant flows that are manually triggered from the **Automate** action menu on lists, cards, and document pages.

    Create and manually trigger a Power Automate flow on a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, with options to manipulate information both internally and externally (using integrated tools).

* Approval workflows based on built-in workflow templates

  On the **Workflow Templates** page, you can see all available workflows. The trial version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many preconfigured workflows represented by workflow templates you can copy to create new ones. When you open a template from the **Workflow Templates** page, and the workflow name starts with *MS-*, then the template was added by Microsoft.

## Power Automate flows

With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can sign up for Power Automate to build powerful automated workflows. You run those workflows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The flows can connect internal and external data sources and tools, without coding knowledge.

## Approval workflows

Create an approval workflow by defining what starts the workflow and what happens next, as follows:

* A workflow event, which is moderated by event conditions.
* A workflow response, which is moderated by response options.

To define workflow steps, fill in fields on workflow lines using the event and response values that represent supported scenarios.

Examples of approval workflow events include the creation of sales or purchase orders/quotes/invoices, price changes, vendor or customer edits, and more.

# Introduction to Microsoft Fabric and Business Central

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] is an end-to-end analytics solution with full-service capabilities including data movement, data lakes, data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence&mdash;all backed by a shared platform providing robust data security, governance, and compliance. Your organization no longer needs to stitch together individual analytics services from multiple vendors. Instead, use a streamlined solution that’s easy to connect, onboard, and operate.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Microsoft Fabric release plan, see [aka.ms/FabricRoadmap](https://aka.ms/FabricRoadmap)
> 
> The regular publishing of this roadmap will help you stay informed about how [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] will address your needs.

## Where does [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] fit into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] analytics

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many out-of-the-box reports and data analysis capabilities such as financial reporting, open in Excel, and analysis mode on lists and queries. On top of this, it's easy to define Power BI reports that read data from standard and custom APIs, define Power BI metrics scorecards, and embed all of these directly in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. But for customers with more advanced data science or business intelligence scenarios that require richer data engineering or data integration, [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] might be a good option. 

## OneLake

A key part of [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] offering is OneLake. OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. You can think of OneLake as the OneDrive for data. It provides you with data lake as a service without having to build it yourself. OneLake comes automatically with every [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] tenant with no infrastructure to manage. All the data, which lands in OneLake, automatically takes part in out-of-the-box data governance such as data lineage, data protection, certification, and catalog integration. It breaks down data silos by enabling different parts of the organization to work independently while still contributing to the same data lake.

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] items store your data in OneLake in an open file format. For structured tabular data, this format is *delta parquet*. Delta parquet format allows every analytics engine in [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] to access the data from other analytics engines. This way, it allows flexibility for data practitioners to use the tools of your choice.

# Get the Business Central desktop app

If you have a Windows (PC) or macOS computer, you can install a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app on your desktop. The app works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises.

## Why use the app?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app resembles the web client, but it provides a few benefits like:

- The app is readily available from the **Start** menu, you can easily pin it to the task bar, or have it launch by default when you start your computer.
- In general, the app also is a faster and smoother to render on screen, with no performance differences, compared to running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the browser.
- The app opens in its own window, independent of any browser windows. This feature makes it easier to find when running a large number many apps or browser tabs.
- If there's more than one [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment (online only), you can install the app separately for each environment.

     When you open the app for specific environment, the environment name is included in the window title. When working across multiple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, each app window is displayed separately. The name makes it easier for you to see which window is associated with each environment.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

There are two ways to install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. You can install it directly from the browser or from Microsoft Store. Whichever approach you use, it's the same app. The difference is that  installing from the browser lets you install the app for each environment when there's more than one.

### From Microsoft Store

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2182870).
2. Choose **Get** > **Install**. 
3. When the app has been installed, choose **Open**, then sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The next time you want to open the app, look for it in **Start** menu.

### From the browser

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client in either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

2. If the page for selecting the environment appears, you can do one of two things:

   - Select the environment and go to the next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment you select.
   - Don't select the environment, and just go to next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment selection page, instead of a specific environment.

3. To install the app, depending on your browser, select ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central**, then **Install**.

   | Microsoft Edge | Google Chrome |
   |--|--|
   | :::image type="content" source="media/ui-edge-install-app-v2.png" alt-text="illustration of a button for installing an app in Edge."::: | :::image type="content" source="media/ui-chrome-install-app-v2.png" alt-text="illustration of a button for installing an app in Chrome."::: |

  > [!TIP]
  > With Edge, you can also install the app by going to the **Settings and more** menu in the browser, then selecting **Apps** > **Install this site as an app** > **Install**.

Once installed, the app appears in the **Start** menu. If you've selected a specific environment for the app, the environment name is added to the app name in the **Start** menu.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Installing the desktop app when you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises is done directly from the browser as [described above](#from-the-browser). If you only have one tenant, just open [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your browser, and select either ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central** as shown above.

The difference is when you have multiple tenants. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, where you can install the app for different environments, you can only install the app for one tenant. So before you install the app when you have multiple tenants, be sure to switch to the correct tenant. Once installed, when you open the app, it will directly open the tenant.

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

# Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

On the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page, which you open from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal.

Similar functionality exists to reconcile excess amounts on payment reconciliation journal lines on an ad-hoc basis. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments that Can't be Applied Automatically](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

Payments posted based on text-to-account mapping are not applied to open entries, but are merely posted to the specified accounts in addition to creating bank account ledger entries. Accordingly, text-to-account mapping is suited for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. For more information, see the "Example - Text-to-Account Mapping for Fuel Expense" section in this article.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Payments on reconciliation journal lines are only set to posting according to text-to-account mapping if the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**. If the automatic application function provides a match confidence of High, then the payment is automatically applied to one or more open entries, and the payment is not posted to the accounts specified on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. In other words, a match confidence of **High** overrules a text-to-account mapping.

On a payment reconciliation journal line where the payment has been set to posting according to text-to-account mapping, the **Match Confidence** field contains **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**, and the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields contain the mapped accounts.

## To map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
4. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on payments that you want to post to specified accounts without applying to an open entry. You can enter up to 50 characters.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If no other payments exist with the mapping text in question, then the text-to-account mapping will occur even when only a part of the text on the payment exists as a mapping text.
5. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the payments will be posted to.
6. In the **Bal. Source Type** field, specify if the payment will be posted to a general ledger account or to a customer or vendor account.
7. In the **Bal. Source No.** field, specify the account that the payment will be posted to, depending on your selection in the **Bal. Source Type** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not use the **Debit Acc. No.** and **Credit Acc. No.** fields in connection with payment reconciliation. They are used for incoming documents only. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for all text on payments that you want to map to accounts for direct posting without application.

Next time you import a bank statement file or choose the **Apply Automatically** action on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, journal lines for the payments that contain the specified mapping text will contain the mapped accounts in the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields. The **Match Confidence** field will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**. This is on the condition that the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**.

## Example: Text-to-Account mapping for bank fees

To always post expenses that are related to fees from a specific bank, MyBank, to the general ledger account for bank charges and fees (account 60400), fill a line on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page as follows.

| Mapping Text | Debit Acc. No. | Credit Acc. No. | Bal. Source Type | Bal. Source No. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyBank |BLANK |60400|G/L Account |BLANK |

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Set up email

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

People in businesses send information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email every day. Administrators can connect one or more email accounts to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], letting you send documents without having to open an email app. You can compose each message individually with basic formatting tools, such as fonts, styles, colors, and so on, and add attachments of up to 100 MB. Additionally, report layouts enable administrators to include only the key information from documents. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

Email capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are for outbound messages only. You can't receive replies, that is, there's no "Inbox" page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the email capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only with Exchange Online. We don't support hybrid scenarios, such as connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to an on-premises version of Exchange.
>
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, before you can set up email you must create an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the Azure Portal. The app registration will enable [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to authorize and authenticate with your email provider. Learn more at [Set Up Email for Business Central On-Premises](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-email-for-business-central-on-premises). In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we handle this for you.

## Requirements

There are a couple of requirements for setting up and using the email features.

* To set up email, you must have the **EMAIL SETUP** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).
* Everyone who uses the email features must be a fully licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, delegated admins and guest users can't use the tenant's email account.
* Everyone who uses the email features must have a valid, paid license for Exchange Online. Otherwise, some features won’t work. For example, they can’t send emails because Exchange rejects their messages. You can’t use trial licenses.

## Add email accounts

You add email accounts through extensions that enable accounts from different providers to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The standard extensions let you use accounts from Microsoft Exchange Online. However, other extensions that let you connect accounts from other providers, such as Gmail, might be available.

You can specify predefined business scenarios in which to use an email account to send emails. For example, you can specify that all users send sales documents from one account, and purchase documents from another. Learn more at [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

The following table describes the email extensions that are available by default.

|Extension  |Description  |Examples of when to use  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Microsoft 365 Connector**|Everyone sends email from a shared mailbox in Exchange Online.|When all messages come from the same department, for example, your sales organization sends messages from a sales@cronus.com account. This option requires that you set up a shared mailbox in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Shared mailboxes](/Exchange/collaboration/shared-mailboxes/shared-mailboxes).|
|**Current User Connector**|Everyone sends email from the account they used to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Allow communications from individual accounts.|
|**SMTP Connector**|Use Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) protocol to send emails.|Allow communications through your SMTP mail server. |

The **Microsoft 365 Connector** and **Current User Connector** extensions use the accounts you set up for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center for your Microsoft 365 subscription. To send email using the extensions, users must have a valid license for Exchange Online. Additionally, in sandbox environments, these extensions, including the **Outlook REST API** extension, require that the **Allow HttpClient Requests** setting is enabled. To check whether it's enabled for these extensions, go to the **Extension Management** page, choose the extension, and then choose the **Configure** option.

External users, such as delegated admins and external accountants, can't use these extensions to send email messages from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> If you’re using service-to-service (S2S) authentication, the Microsoft 365 and Current user connectors can’t authenticate the user when they send a sales or purchase document by email. When someone sends a document, the following error message displays:
>
> “You are not authorized to access this resource: https:\//graph.microsoft.com/.default. Contact your system administrator."
>
> The problem is caused by the bound actions on the document APIs that send email. To learn more about the bound actions, go to [Bound Actions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/resources/dynamics_salesinvoice#bound-actions). 
>
> If you want to use S2S authentication and the email features, use the SMTP connector option.
<br><br>

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a18f480a-f0d5-4248-8acb-ec667a7f53e1]

## Use SMTP

If you want to use SMTP protocol to send emails from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the SMTP Connector extension. When you set up an account that uses SMTP, the **Sender Type** field is important. If you choose **Specific User**, emails are sent using the name and other information from the account you're setting up. However, if you choose **Current User**, emails are sent from the email account specified for each user's account. Current User is similar to the Send As feature. For more information, see [Use a Substitute Sender Address on Outbound Email Messages](admin-how-setup-email.md#use-a-substitute-sender-address-on-outbound-email-messages). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Auth 2.0 for SMTP authentication, consider the following:
>
> - All users must be on the same Microsoft Entra tenant.
> - You can't use **Specific User** for the **Sender type**, as you can with Basic authentication. The reason is that OAUTH 2.0 uses the credentials of the current (signed-in) user.
> - For Business Central on-premises, you must create an application registration in the Azure portal, and then run the **Set up Microsoft Entra ID** assisted setup guide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more at [Create an App Registration for Business Central in Azure Portal](admin-how-setup-email.md#create-an-app-registration-for-business-central-in-azure-portal).
>
> Exchange Online is deprecating use of Basic authentication for SMTP. Tenants that are currently using SMTP AUTH won't be affected by this change. However, we strongly recommend using the latest version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and setting up OAuth 2.0 authentication for SMTP. We currently don't support certificate-based authentication. If you can't set up OAuth 2.0 authentication, we encourage you to explore third-party alternatives if you want to use SMTP email in earlier versions.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

## Use the Set Up Email assisted setup guide

The **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide can help you get started quickly with emails.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a default email account, even if you add only one account. The default account will be used for all email scenarios that aren't assigned to an account. Learn more at [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set Up Email Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> If you choose **Other (SMTP)** and are using an account that requires two-factor authentication, the password that you enter in the **Password** field must be the same that you use for your Microsoft 365 subscription, and it must be of type **App Password**. For more information, see [Manage app passwords for two-step verification](/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords). 

is this still true?-->
## Assign email scenarios to email accounts

Email scenarios are processes that involve sending a document. For example, a sales or purchase order or a notification, such as an invitation to an external accountant. Specific email accounts can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can specify that all users always send sales documents from one account, purchase documents from another, and warehouse or production documents from a third account. You can assign, reassign, and remove scenarios whenever you want. A scenario can only be assigned to one email account at a time. The default email account is used for all scenarios that aren't assigned to an account.

On the **Email Scenario Assignment** page, you can choose the **Set Default Attachments** action to add attachments to email scenarios. The attachments will always be available when you compose an email for a document related to the scenario. Each email scenario can have one or more default attachments. Default attachments are automatically added to emails for the email scenario. For example, when you send a sales order by email, the default attachment specified for the Sales Order scenario will be added. Default attachments display in the **Attachments** section at the bottom of the **Compose an Email** page. You can manually add non-default attachments to the email.

<!--
## To set up email
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using an account that requires two-factor authentication, then the password that you enter in the **Password** field must be the same that you use for your Microsoft 365 subscription and it must be of type **App Password**. For more information, see [Manage app passwords for two-step verification](/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords).
3. Alternatively, choose the **Apply Microsoft 365 Server Settings** action to insert any information that is already defined for your Microsoft 365 subscription.
4. When all the fields are correctly filled in, choose the **Test Email Setup** action.
5. When the test succeeds, close the page.

-->

## Set up view policies

You can control the email messages that a user can access in the Email Outbox and Sent Emails pages.

On the **User Email View Policies**, choose a user, and then choose one of the following options in the **Email View Policy** field:

* **View own emails** - The user can view only their own email messages.
* **View all emails** - The user can view all email messages, including emails that were sent by other users.
* **View if access to all related records** - This view policy is used if no other policy is specified. A user can view email messages that other users sent if the user has access to the record that was sent and all of the related records. For example, User A sent a posted sales invoice to a customer. User B can see the email message if they have access to both the invoice and the customer.
* **View if access to any related records** - The user can view email messages that were sent by other people if the user has access to at least one record that is related to the record that was sent. For example, User A sent a posted sales invoice to a customer. User B can see the email message if they have access to either the invoice or the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave the **User ID** field empty and then choose the **Email View Policy** action, the view policy applies to all users.

## Specify how many messages an account can send per minute

Some email providers (ISPs) limit the number of email messages an email account can send in one go, or within a certain amount of time, or both. Known as *email throttling*, the practice helps ISPs control traffic on their servers and prevent spam. If an email account exceeds the limit, the ISP might block the messages. To ensure that the number of messages that you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] complies with your ISP's limit, specify the limit for each of your email accounts.

The default limit for the Microsoft 365 and Current User account types is 30, which matches the limit set by Exchange Online.

There are two ways to specify the limit:

* When you use the Set Up Email assisted setup guide to create a new account, specify the limit in the **Rate limit per minute** field.
* For existing email accounts, specify the limit in the **Email rate limit** field on the account.

## Set up reusable email texts and layouts

You can use reports to include key information from sales, purchase, and service documents in texts for emails. Report layouts define the style and the content of the text in the email. For example, the content might include texts such as a greeting or instructions that precede the document information. This procedure describes how to set up the **Sales - Invoice** report for posted sales invoices, but the process is similar for other reports.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the layout to create content for email messages, you must use the Word file type for your layout.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections - Sales**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Sales** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Invoice**.
3. On a new line, in the **Report ID** field, select, for example, standard report 1306.
4. Select the **Use for Email Body** checkbox.
5. Choose the **Email Body Layout Description** field, and then select a layout from the list.
6. To view or edit the layout that the email text is based on, select the layout on the **Custom Report Layouts** page, and then choose the **Export Layout** action. If you customize the layout, use the **Import Layout** action to upload the new layout.
    > [!NOTE]
    > To customize a standard report layout, such as 1306, you must make a copy of the report. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will help you create a copy when you import a custom layout for a standard report. The name of your new custom report layout will be prefixed with "Copy of."
7. If you want to let customers use a payment service, such as PayPal, you have to set up the service. Afterward, the PayPal information and link are inserted in the email text. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through PayPal](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).
8. Choose the **OK** button.

Now, when you choose, for example, the **Send** action on the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, the email body contains the document information of report 1306 preceded by styled standard text according to the report layout that you selected in step 5.

## Use a substitute sender address on outbound email messages

If you're using the SMTP Connector extension, you can use the **Send As** or **Send on Behalf** capabilities from Microsoft Exchange to change the sender address on outbound messages. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the SMTP account to authenticate to Exchange, but will either replace the sender address with the one you specify, or amend it with "on behalf of."

When you set up an account and you want to use the Send As or Send on Behalf capabilities from Exchange, in the **Sender Type** field, choose **Specific User**.

Alternatively, you can choose **Current User** to allow people to send messages through the SMTP Connector. The message will appear to be sent from the email account specified in the Contact Email field on the User Card for the user they're signed in as. However, it will function similar to the Send As feature and will be sent from the account specified in the setup of the SMTP Connector.

The following are examples of how Send As and Send on Behalf are used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* You might want the purchase or sales orders that you send to vendors and customers to appear to come from a _noreply@yourcompanyname.com_ address.
* When your workflow sends an approval request by email using the email address of the requester.

> [!Note]
> You can only use one account to substitute sender addresses. That is, you cannot have one substitute address for purchasing processes, and another for sales processes.

<!--
### To set up the substitute sender address for all outbound email messages
1. In the **Exchange admin center** for your Microsoft 365 account, find the mailbox to use as the substitute address, and then copy or make a note of the address. If you need a new address, go to your Microsoft 365 admin center to create a new user and set up their mailbox.
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
3. In the **Send As** field, enter the substitute address.
4. Copy or make a note of the address in the **User ID** field.
5. In the **Exchange admin center**, find the mailbox to use as the substitute address, and then enter the address from the **User ID** field in the **Send As** field. For more information, see [Use the EAC to assign permissions to individual mailboxes](/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-permissions?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true#use-the-eac-to-assign-permissions-to-individual-mailboxes).

### To use the substitute address in approval workflows
1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Copy or make a note of the address in the **User ID** field.
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. In the **Exchange admin center**, find the mailboxes for each user listed in the **Approval User Setup** page, and in the **Send As** field enter the address from the **User ID** field of the **SMTP Email Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Manage permissions for recipients](/Exchange/recipients/mailbox-permissions?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).
5. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
6. To enable substitution, turn on the **Allow Sender Substitution** toggle.

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will determine which address to display in the following order: <br><br> 1. The address specified in the **E-Mail** field on the **Approval User Setup** page for messages in a workflow. <br> 2. The address specified in the **Send As** field in the **SMTP Email Setup** page. <br> 3. The address specified in the **User ID** field in the **SMTP Email Setup** page. -->

## Set up document sending profiles

You can save time by setting up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each of your customers. You won't have to select a sending option, such as whether to send the document by email or as an electronic document, every time you send a document. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

## Optional: Set up email logging in Exchange Online

Get more out of the communications between salespeople and your existing or potential customers. You can track email exchanges, and then turn them into actionable opportunities. Learn more at [Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts](marketing-set-up-email-logging.md).  
<!--
[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online. For more information, see [Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts](marketing-set-up-email-logging.md).  -->

## Optional: Monitor email usage and troubleshoot email failures with telemetry

Administrators can switch on the telemetry feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to get data about usage and failures of different capabilities. For email, we log the following operations:

* An email was sent successfully  
* An attempt to send an email failed
* Authentication to an SMTP server succeeded/failed  
* Connection to an SMTP server succeeded/failed  

Learn more at [Analyzing Email Telemetry (administration content)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-email-trace).  

## Set up email for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can integrate with services that are based on Microsoft Azure. For example, you can use Cortana Intelligence for smarter cash flow forecasts, Power BI to visualize your business, and Exchange Online for sending email. Integration with these services is based on an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services for communications. To use the email capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you must register [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as an app in the Azure portal, and then connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the app registration. The following sections describe how.

### Create an app registration for Business Central in Azure portal

The steps to register [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Azure portal are described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the email features, your app registration must use a multi-tenant configuration.

The settings that are specific to the email capabilities are the delegated permissions that you grant to your app registration. The following table lists the minimum permissions.

|API / Permission Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Graph/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.ReadWrite |Delegated|Compose email messages.         |
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.Send|Delegated|Send email messages.         |
|Microsoft Graph/offline_access|Delegated|Maintain data access consent.|
|Microsoft Graph/Mail.Send.Shared|Delegated|Shared Mailbox|

If you're using the SMTP Connector and want to use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, the permissions are slightly different. The following table lists the permissions.

|API / Permission Name  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Graph/offline_access|Delegated|Maintain data access consent.|
|Microsoft Graph/openid|Delegated|Sign users in.|
|Microsoft Graph/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |
|Microsoft Graph/SMTP.Send|Delegated|Send emails from mailboxes using SMTP AUTH.         |
|Office 365 Exchange Online/User.Read |Delegated|Sign in and read user profile.         |

When you create your app registration, note the following information. You'll need it to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration.

* Application (client) ID
* Redirect URI (optional)
* Client secret

Learn more about general guidelines for registering an app at [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

> [!NOTE]
If you have trouble using the SMTP protocol to send email after you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration, it might be because SMTP AUTH is not enabled for your tenant. We recommend that you use the Microsoft 365 and Current User email connectors instead, because they use Microsoft Graph Mail APIs. However, if you must use SMTP protocol you can enable SMTP AUTH. For more information, see [Enable or disable authenticated client SMTP submission (SMTP AUTH) in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission#disable-smtp-auth-in-your-organization).

### Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your app registration

After you register your application in Azure portal, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Email Microsoft Entra application registration** page to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to it.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Microsoft Entra application registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, if you're connecting for the first time, you can run the **Set up email** assisted setup guide. In this case, the guide includes the Email Microsoft Entra application registration page for connecting to your app registration. <!--Need to verify this too.

# Set up item tracking with serial, lot, and package numbers

Keep track of inventory items, even in complex warehouse configurations, by assigning numbers that are specific to each item. You can use numbers for individual objects, lots, or packages. With item tracking, you can trace items across internal warehouse movements, and outbound and inbound documents.

Items with serial and lot numbers can be traced both backwards and forward in the supply chain. Tracing is useful for general quality assurance and for product recalls. For more information, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md).  

## Numbers and item tracking

As part of your warehouse processes, you can bundle your stock in packages, boxes, containers, and so on. But in order to keep track of the items, you assign unique numbers as identification. For example, you manufacture and sell a chair that has the item number *1900-S*. Each chair has a serial number, *1001*, but you also bundle four chairs into a lot, *LOT0001*. You also ship the chairs in a container with the package number *CONTAINER010* that also includes *LOT0100* with side tables, and *LOT200* with lamps.  

Depending on your configuration, you use these different numbers to keep track of inventory in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the various stages of purchasing, sales, warehouse operations, and so on.

## To set up item tracking codes

An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, and the **Package Tracking** FastTabs, define policies of item tracking by serial, lot, and package numbers respectively.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to track specific items or specific lots throughout their lifetime, you must choose the **SN Specific Tracking**, **Lot Specific Tracking**, and **Package Specific Tracking** fields, respectively. As a result, when you handle an outbound unit of an item with this item tracking code, you must always specify which serial number or lot number to handle. This means that when you sell a unit of the item, it must be applied against a specific pool of serial numbers or lot numbers. In other words, the serial, lot, or package number assigned to the item when it enters inventory must follow the item when it leaves inventory.

Because these setup fields cover all possible transactions with the item, the individual inbound/outbound fields are selected. However, the individual inbound/outbound fields have nothing to do with application across inventory. They merely define your company's work flow concerning when to assign item tracking numbers.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To assign item tracking numbers in warehouse activities, the **SN Warehouse Tracking** and **Lot Warehouse Tracking** fields must be selected on the item's item tracking code card.  

## To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, select the following fields:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Strict Expiration Posting**|Specifies that the expiration date for the item tracking number when it entered inventory is respected when it exits inventory.|  
    |**Require Expiration Date Entry**|Specifies that you must enter an expiration date on the item tracking line.|  
    |**Use Expiration Dates**|Specifies that you want to calculate expiration dates. |  

## To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory expire.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, fill in the **Warranty Date Formula** field, and then select the fields as follows:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Warranty Date Formula**|Specifies the last day of warranty for the item.|  
    |**Require Warranty Date Entry**|Specifies that you must manually enter a warranty date on the item tracking line.|  

## To set up items for tracking with the correct item tracking codes

To enable item tracking, you first have to assign the item tracking codes to an item. There are two ways to add item tracking codes, by selecting the code from a predefined list or by assigning a new unique code. Hover over the fields to read a short description.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item from the list, and open the **Item Card** page.  
3. On the **Item Tracking** FastTab, assign the appropriate item tracking codes and choose the **Item Tracking Code**, the **Serial Nos.**, and the **Lot Nos.**.
    1. Alternatively you can also create a new item tracking code by selecting the **New** action.

## To specify opening balances for the items, you track

You can create opening balances for the items you track. Because you can choose different warehouse configurations, there are two options:

* Enable specific batches on the **Item Journal** page to let people enter serial, lot, and package data directly on journal lines.
* For locations where the **Directed Put-away and Pick** toggle is turned on, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page to make all item tracking fields available. The fields that are available include the **Warranty Date** and **Expiration Date** fields.

### Item journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To open a list of item journal batches, choose the **Name** field.
3. Choose **New** to create a new batch, and then turn on the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.
4. Choose **OK** to select the batch you created.
5. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
    1. Alternatively choose the **Edit in Excel** action. Using Excel lets you quickly fill in columns, including **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, **Package No.**, **Expiration Date**, and **Warranty Date**. When you're done, choose **Publish** to send changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose the **Post** action to adjust inventory.

> [!NOTE] 
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does a few minor validations when you enter or import data. A more comprehensive check happens when you post or transfer data from journal lines to the **Item Tracking** page. The latter happens automatically when you open the **Item Tracking** page from the item journal line or if you choose the **Update Item Tracking Lines** action.

### Warehouse physical inventory journal for locations where directed pick and put-away is turned on  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
3. Choose the **Register** action to make the inventory adjustments. Remember to synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries. To learn more, go to [synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

For bulk imports, use configuration packages to import data to the journals.

# Use a Power Automate flow to timely synchronize Dataverse entity changes

Administrators can create an automated flow in Power Automate that notifies your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] about changes to records in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] organization.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you've connected your online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and scheduled synchronization between the two applications.

## Import the Flow Template

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to set up the flow, we've created a template that will define the flow trigger and flow condition for you. To use the template, follow the steps in this section. To create the flow yourself, skip this section and start with the steps in [Define the Flow Trigger](#define-the-flow-trigger).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
2. Choose **Templates**, and then search for **Notify Business Central**.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-import-template.png" alt-text="Keywords to find the flow template.":::
3. Choose the **Notify Business Central when an account changes** template.
4. Continue with the steps in the [Notify Business Central about a change](#notify-business-central-about-a-change) section.

## Define the Flow Trigger

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
2. Create an automated cloud flow that starts when a row for a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is added, modified, or deleted. For more information, see [Trigger flows when a row is added, modified, or deleted](/power-automate/dataverse/create-update-delete-trigger). This example uses the **Accounts** entity. The following image shows the settings for the first step in defining a flow trigger.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-trigger.png" alt-text="Settings for the flow's trigger":::
3. Use the **AssistEdit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
4. Choose **Show advanced options**, and in the **Filter Rows** field, enter **customertypecode eq 3** or **customertypecode eq 11** and **statecode eq 0**. These values mean that the trigger will react only when changes are made to active accounts of the type **customer** or **vendor**.

## Define the Flow Condition

Data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] through an integration user account. To ignore the changes made by the synchronization, create a condition step in your flow that excludes changes made by the integration user account.  

1. Add a **Get a row by ID from Dataverse** step after the flow trigger with the following settings. For more information, see [Get a row by ID from Dataverse](/power-automate/dataverse/get-row-id).

    1. In the **Table name** field, choose **Users**
    2. In the **Row ID** field, choose the **Modified By (Value)** from the flow trigger.  

2. Add a condition step with the following **or** settings to identify the integration user account.
    1. The user's **Primary Email Address** contains **contoso.com**
    2. The user's **Full Name** contains **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.

3. Add a Terminate control to stop the flow if the entity was changed by the integration user account.

The following image shows how to define the flow trigger and the flow condition.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse.png" alt-text="Overview of flow trigger and condition settings":::

## Notify Business Central About a Change

If the flow isn't stopped by the condition, you must notify [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that a change occurred. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector to do that.

1. In the **No** fork of the condition step, add an action and search for **Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. Choose the connector icon in the list.
2. Choose the **Create record (V3)** action.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-connector.png" alt-text="Settings for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector":::

3. Use the **assist edit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. When connected, fill in the **Environment name** and **Company name** fields.
5. In the **API category** field, enter **microsoft/dataverse/v1.0**.
6. In the **Table name** field, enter **dataverseEntityChanges**.
7. In the **entityName** field, enter **account**.
8. Save the flow.

The following image shows how your flow should look.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-summary.png" alt-text="Overview of all settings for the flow":::

When you add, delete, or modify an account in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment, this flow will do the following actions:

1. Call the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that you specified in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector.
2. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API to insert a record with the **entityName** set to **account** in the **Dataverse Entry Change** table. This parameter is the exact name of the Dataverse entity that you're creating the flow for.
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will start the job queue entry that synchronizes customers with accounts.

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_sku_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for stock-keeping units.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as an item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_reservations.png" alt-text="Planning with reservations.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The planning system may have consumed the safety stock intentionally and will then replenish it straight away. Learn more at [Consume safety stock](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#consume-safety-stock).

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_error_log.png" alt-text="Error messages in the planning worksheet.":::

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.

# Create Service Orders
You can use the **Service Order** page to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request.  

When creating a service order, you only have to fill in a few fields. Some fields are optional and many are automatically filled in when you fill in related fields.  

## To create a service order    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  

     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders on the **Service Management Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service order number.  

4. In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list. The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  

5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Management Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
7. Register the service item lines.  

## To create a service order from a contract  
You can automatically create service orders for the maintenance of service items based on service contracts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Contract Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Service Contract Header** FastTab, set the filters you want to apply.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields with the starting date and ending date for the period that you want to create contract service orders for. The batch job creates service orders that include service items in service contracts with next planned service dates within this period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There is a limit to the number of days you can use as the date range each time you use this batch job. You set this limit in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field on the **Service Management Setup** page.  

4. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Service Order**.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You will not be able to create order with multiple service item, if you set **One Service Item Line/Order** field on the **Service Management Setup** page. 

## To convert a service quote to a service order
When a customer has accepted a service quote, you convert it to a service order. The quote is deleted and a new service order is set up with the same description as the service quote. The response date and time are recalculated for the service order and the status is set to **Pending**. The repair status of the service items in the order are changed to **Initial**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for allocation entries for all the service items in the service quote that have the status **Active**. If it finds such allocation entries, their allocation status is updated to **Reallocation Needed**. When you reallocate the service items in the service order, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote are updated to **Finished**.   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service quote to convert to a service order.  
3. Choose the **Make Order** action.  

## To check item availability for one or more orders  
You can check and see if an item you need to fulfill an order is in stock, and if it is not, when the item will be in stock. In addition, if an item is available to reserve, you can reserve it to make sure it is available for your use. You can check availability for a particular order, or for all orders.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following:  

    * For a particular order, choose the order, and then choose the **Demand Overview** action.  
    * For all orders, choose **Show Document**. The **Service Order** page opens.  

3. On the **Demand Overview** page, expand the item grouping, and view information about the availability of the item. For example, you can see how many items are in inventory. You can also see if and when an item will be available if it is on back order, that is, Source Type = Purchase, or whether it has been reserved.

## To reserve an item for a service order
If you need to be sure that an item is available for a service order, you can reserve the item.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. On the **Service Lines** page, choose the item to reserve, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. On the **Reservation** page, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.

## To insert lines based on standard service codes  
If you have set up standard service codes and assigned them to service item groups, you can insert the standard lines linked to the standard service codes on service documents. For more information, see [Set Up Standard Service Codes](service-how-setup-service-coding.md).   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary..  
4. Fill in the service item lines with the required information.  
5. Choose the line with the service item that you want to create service lines for, and then choose **Get Std. Service Codes**. The **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page opens with the standard codes for the service item group specified on the line.  
6. Choose the appropriate code, and choose the **OK** button to enter standard service lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **Service Item Group Code** field on the service item line of the document is blank, this means that the service item does not belong to any service item group. In this case, the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page will contain a list of all standard service codes. You should select from the list to insert standard service lines in the document. You may also select from the list of standard service codes assigned to a specific service item group. To view the list, select the relevant code in the **Service Item Group Code** field on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page.  

## To register internal or public comments
You can add comments that will be printed on service orders and service quotes to provide additional information. You can add up to 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, choose another line. To register a comment, choose a line, and then choose the **Comments** action.  

## To delete invoiced service orders  
Orders are usually deleted automatically after having been fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. The posted document can be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoice** page.  

Service orders are not deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order has been posted not from the service order itself, but from the **Service Invoice** page. Then you may need to delete invoiced orders that were not deleted. You can do this by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Service Orders**, and then choose the related link. The **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job request page opens.  
2. To select the orders to be deleted, you can set filters in the **No.**, **Customer No.**, and **Bill-to Customer No.** fields.  
3. Choose **OK**.

# Allocate revenue and costs to multiple general ledger accounts

This article describes how to use allocation accounts to distribute amounts on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines to different G/L accounts. You can allocate amounts through a fixed or variable distribution.  

Allocation splits a general journal line into the lines defined on the **Allocation Account** page. For example, if you split a rent expense three ways using dimensions, you'll have three lines to post for the allocation. Therefore, you'll have six G/L lines (or possibly more if you're using VAT or sales tax). Although this posts more G/L entries than you might need, it allows you to reverse individual lines instead of reversing the whole allocation.

Allocation accounts also work with deferrals. To learn more about deferrals, go to [Defer Revenues and Expenses](finance-how-defer-revenue-expenses.md).

The following table introduces the allocation methods you can use.

|Allocation Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Fixed     | When you want to split up expenses in a way that's repeated over a longer period of time, you can use a fixed allocation. A fixed allocation lets you define the allocation split. This split will only change when you change the setup on the **Allocation Account** page.        |
|Variable     | To distribute revenue or expenses based on values that change over time, use the variable allocation method. Variable allocations let you specify the sources to use to calculate the allocation percentages. This method is useful, for example, for splitting employee costs that according to varying headcounts in departments or divisions. Another example is the distributing the cost of rent based on production floor footage that might vary per production line over time. Variable allocations use a combination of dimensions and statistical accounts to determine how amounts distribute over a period of time. To learn more about statistical accounts, go to [Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts](bi-use-statistical-accounts.md). To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).        |

## Use a fixed share or percentage method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Fixed**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account** or **Bank Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.
1. In the **Share** and **Percent** fields, specify how to distribute amounts to the destination account.
  
   > [!TIP]
   > If you enter the actual amount to allocate for a fixed allocation in the **Share** field, the **Percent** field shows the percentage of the total amount.
1. Repeat this process for each account to include in the allocation.

## Use a variable method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Variable**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. In the **Breakdown Account Type** field, choose **Statistical Account**.
1. In the **Calculation Period** field, choose the period for which to distribute amounts.
1. Optional: To filter on specific global dimension values, choose the **Breakdown account balance filters** action, and then specify the filter values.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.

## Allocate amounts on the fly

You create allocation accounts to split revenue and costs for G/L accounts and bank accounts. Automating allocation can save time. However, if you want to use allocation accounts, but you don't want to create them for each G/L account, you can save even more time.

The Inherit from parent option lets you use the allocation account to split amounts for any G/L account on a line on a document or journal. In the **Account Type** field on a document or journal line, you choose a G/L account, and then choose the allocation account in the **Allocation Account No.** field. The amount on the line is split for the G/L account according to the setup in your allocation account. It's a less transparent way of allocating, but you don't have to create an allocation account specifically for the G/L account.

Ad-hoc allocations are easy to set up. Instead of specifying a bank or G/L account in the **Destination Account Type** field on the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Inherit from parent** option. Leave the **Destination Account Number** field blank. When you choose the G/L account on the document or journal line, that account is used to allocate amounts.

## Verify that amounts distribute correctly before you post them

There are a couple of ways to verify that amounts distribute correctly:

* On the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Test Allocation** action. Use the **Amount to Allocate** field to test different amounts.
* On the **General Ledger Journals** page, choose the journal, and then use the **Posting Preview** action.

## Adjust the distribution

If you find something in an allocation that you'd like to change, you can adjust the allocation before you post it.  

1. Open the document or journal that has the allocation you want to change.
1. Choose the line, and then choose the **Redistribute Account Allocations** action.
1. On the **Change Allocations** page, make your adjustment.

## Post an allocation transaction

The following steps describe how to post an allocation transaction from a general journal. The steps are the same for sales and purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Create a new line. Fill in the fields in the same way you would for any other type of general journal.
1. If you're using a fixed or variable allocation, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Allocation Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the allocation account.
1. If you're using an allocation that uses the Inherit from parent option, do the following:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the G/L account.
    1. In the **Allocation Account No.** field, choose the allocation account that's set up to use the Inherit from parent option. 
1. Choose **Post**.

# Close open item ledger entries resulting from fixed application in the item journal

You can use the **Applies-from Entry** field on the **Item Journal** page to create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction. For example, to correct the outbound transaction or to process its return.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Fixed applications made in this manner only apply the cost, not the quantity. Accordingly, the posted positive item ledger entry will not close the applied outbound entry and will itself remain open. This also applies when you post a fixed application for a positive entry to a negative entry that has not been closed by a regular positive entry, then both the negative and the positive entries will remain open.  
>
> This also means that you cannot close an inventory period if such an entry exists.  

You can change and reapply application entries under certain conditions by using the **Application Worksheet** page.  

The following procedure shows how to close such entries by performing two corrective postings in the item journal.  

## To close open item ledger entries that result from a fixed application in the item journal  

1. Use the **Applies-from Entry** field to post a positive adjustment with the corresponding quantity. This closes the original negative entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-from Entry** field specifies the number of the outbound item ledger entry whose cost is forwarded to the inbound item ledger entry when you post an inbound transaction of type **Positive Adjmt.** or **Purchase** with the item journal.  
2. Use the **Applies-to Entry** field to post a negative adjustment. This closes the original corrective positive entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-to Entry** field specifies if the quantity in the item journal line should be applied to an already-posted document. If so, enter the entry number of the item ledger entry to which the item journal line should be applied.

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Default data for sustainability

To simplify how you manage your sustainability accounts and emissions, you can create default values for the following entities:  

- **G/L Account** (only available default sustainability account)
- **Item** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Resource** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Work Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Machine Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you set default values, you can change them on journals and documents as needed. These values are simply defaults and aren't mandatory.  

## G/L accounts

To set up a default sustainability account for a G/L account, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **No.** field, choose the number for the account you want to configure to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.
4. Close the page.

## Items

For items, you can use the manually entered sustainability account, or use the default value you have on the **Item Category**. The following processes explain both options.

### Specify a default sustainability account for an item category

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item categories**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, choose the code for the category you want to configure to open the **Item Category Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default for the category.
4. Close the page.

### Specify default sustainability values for an item  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to set up default values.  
3. Add the default sustainability account:

   1. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.  
   2. If you configured default sustainability accounts on item categories, select the **Item Category Code** you want to use on the **Item** FastTab. The default value for the category updates the value in **Default Sust. Account** field.

4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this item:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add default emissions only if the **Replenishment System** is set to **Purchase**. For other options, you can only set up the **Default Sust. Account**. CO2e (carbon equivalent) is calculated based on your production or assembly processes. If you already filled in the emissions fields and then change the replenishment system to something other than **Purchase**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing emissions.

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field if you're just setting up this item and you don't have earlier transactions. By default, this action updates this item only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of items.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the item and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The information you enter for emissions and the calculated **CO2e per Unit** are overridden by the system's calculations for this item based on **Sustainability Value Entry**. This data comes from the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, and uses the average method of emission calculation. Therefore, manually calculated **CO2e per Unit** is only used before posting documents with the correct values. This means you can use manual creation for data planning (**Production BOM**, **Assembly Order**, and so on) before you post the related document.

To set up default sustainability values for a resource, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **resources**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for a resource for which you want to set up default values.
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for the resource:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this resource only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the resource and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

# Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning
Supply planning is a critical business area. When set up and used correctly, supply planning helps a company avoid stock out and reduce both ordering costs and inventory costs.  

 It is not possible to prescribe one optimal setup of all planning fields as this varies from company to company because of business variables, such as market situation and business strategy. However, there are best practices for selecting options in items cards and global setup fields to help get the company started with timely and cost-effective inventory flows.  

 The following topics provide best-practice information about how to set up selected planning fields that are key to inventory and supply planning.

# Select a check layout

You can design your checks to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Check images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Checks are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian check image formats in either a check-stub-check format or a stub-stub-check format.

## To select a check layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Check**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Check |This report is the default report. |
| 10411 |Check (Stub/Stub/Check) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/stub/check format. |
| 10412 |Check (Stub/Check/Stub) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/check/stub format. |
| 10413 |Three Checks per Page |This report is designed to print three checks on each page. |

After you set up check layouts, you can print checks from the **Payment Journal** page. Learn more in [Work with Checks](payables-how-work-checks.md).

To change one of these default check layouts, use either the Word or the RDLC integration to do so. Learn more in [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

## Use MICR and security fonts

The online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains preinstalled fonts on the servers that can be used when defining check layouts. The following outlines which fonts are available and have links to detailed information by the 3rd-party suppliers of the fonts.

> [!Important]
> MICR and check security fonts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are licensed in a font package from IDAutomation.com, Inc. These products may only be used as part of and in connection with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In update 15.3 and later, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) fonts are installed and available to use. Both the E-13B and the CMC-7 standards are supported. Special security fonts are also available to generate text, names, amounts, and the currency symbols such as Dollar, Euro, Pound, and Yen, which are hard to tamper with once a check is printed.

> [!NOTE]
> - For security and legal reasons, you cannot upload custom fonts to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment.
> - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the MICR and check security fonts from IDAutomation.com aren't available by default. You must purchase them from IDAutomation.com or another supplier. Once you have the fonts, install them on the computer that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)]. As a minimum, install the fonts for the user that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance, that is, the service account. To install the fonts, follow the instructions from the font supplier or refer to [Add a Font](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1).

# Design Details: Transfers in Planning

Transfer orders are also a source of supply when working at the SKU level. When using multiple locations (warehouses), the SKU replenishment system can be set to Transfer, implying that the location is replenished by transferring goods from another location. In a situation with more warehouses, you might have a chain of transfers. Supply to GREEN location is transferred from YELLOW, supply to YELLOW is transferred from RED, and so on. In the beginning of the chain, there's a replenishment system of **Prod. Order** or **Purchase**.  

![Example of transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers1.png "Example of transfer flow")  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

If you compare the following situations, it's clear that the planning task in the latter can become complex:

* A supply order is directly facing a demand order
* A sales order is supplied through a chain of SKU transfers

If demand changes, it might cause a ripple effect through the chain. All transfer orders, plus the purchase and production order in the opposite end of the chain, will have to be updated to re-balance demand and supply.  

![Example of supply/demand balance in transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers2.png "Example of supply/demand balance in transfers")  

## Why is a transfer a special case?  

Transfer orders are similar to other orders, such as purchase and production orders. However, behind the scene they're different.  

One difference is that a transfer line represents both demand and supply. The outbound part that's shipped is demand. The inbound part that's received at the new location is supply at that location.  

![Content of the Transfer Order page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers3.png "Content of the Transfer Order page")  

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the supply side of the transfer, it must make a similar change on the demand side.  

## Transfers are dependent demand  

The demand and supply relationship is similar to components on production order lines. The difference is that components on production order lines are on the next planning level, and have a different item. The two parts of the transfer are on the same level for the same item.  

An important similarity is that components and transfers are dependent demand. Demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer. If the supply changes, the demand is directly affected.

Unless the planning flexibility is None, a transfer line shouldn't be treated as independent demand in planning.  

In the planning procedure, the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the planning system has processed the supply side. Before that processing happens, the actual demand isn't known. The sequence of changes is important for transfer orders.  

## Planning sequence  

The following image shows an example of a string of transfers.  

![Example of simple transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers4.png "Example of simple transfer flow")  

In this example, a customer orders the item at location GREEN. Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED. The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE.  

In this example, the planning system starts at the customer demand and works its way back through the chain. The demands and supplies are processed for one location at a time.  

![Supply planning with transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers5.png "Supply planning with transfers")  

## Transfer level code  

The transfer level code of the SKU determines the sequence in which the planning system processes locations.  

The transfer level code is an internal field. The field is calculated and stored on the SKU when you create or modify the SKU. The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of item and item variant. The calculation uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route to use for the SKUs. The calculation ensures that all demands are processed.  

The transfer level code will be 0 for SKUs with Purchase or Prod. Order replenishment system, and will be -1 for the first transfer level, -2 for the second, and so on. In the example described in the previous section, the levels would be -1 for RED and -2 for GREEN, as shown in the following illustration.  

![Content of SKU Card page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers6.gif "Content of SKU Card page")  

When updating a SKU, the planning system detects whether replenishment systems for SKUs have circular references.  

## Planning transfers without SKU  

For less advanced warehouse setups, you can use locations and make manual transfers between locations, even if you don't use SKUs. For example, the transfer might cover a sales order at that location. The planning system reacts to changes in the demand.  

For manual transfers, the planning system analyzes transfer orders and then plans the order in which to process the locations. Internally, the planning system uses temporary SKUs that have transfer level codes.  

![Transfer level code.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers7.png "Transfer level code")  

If there are several transfers to a location, the first transfer order defines the planning direction. Transfers in the opposite direction are canceled.  

## Changing quantity with reservations  

When changing quantities on a supply, the planning system takes reservations into account. The reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much to reduce the supply.  

When you change the quantity on a transfer order line, keep the lower limit in mind. The lower limit is the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer lines.

For example, a transfer order line of 117 pieces is reserved for the following lines:

* A sales line of 46
* A purchase line of 24

Even though the inbound side might have excess supply, you can't reduce the transfer line below 46.  

![Reservations in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers8.png "Reservations in transfer planning")  

## Changing quantity in a transfer chain  

Here's an example of what happens when you change a quantity in a transfer change.

The starting point is a balanced situation with a transfer chain supplying a sales order of 27 at location RED. There's a corresponding purchase order at location BLUE. Both transfers go through location PINK. There are two transfer orders, BLUE-PINK and PINK-RED.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers9.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1")  

Now, the planner at the PINK location chooses to reserve for the purchase.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers10.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2")  

The reservation usually means that the planning system ignores the purchase order and transfer demand. There isn't a problem long as there's balance. But what happens when the RED location changes the order from 27 to 22?  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers11.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3")  

When the planning system runs again, it should get rid of excess supply. However, the reservation locks the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers12.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4")  

The PINK-RED transfer has been reduced to 22. The inbound part of the BLUE-PINK transfer isn't reserved, but the outbound part is. The reservation means that you can't reduce the quantity below 27.  

## Lead time calculation  

When calculating the due date of a transfer order, different kinds of lead time are taken into account.  

The following lead times are active when planning a transfer order:  

* Outbound warehouse handling time  
* Shipping time  
* Inbound warehouse handling time  

On the planning line, the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation:  

* Transfer shipment date  
* Starting date  
* Ending date  
* Due date  

The shipment date of the transfer line is shown in the **Transfer Shipment Date** field. The receipt date of the transfer line is shown in the **Due Date** field.  

The starting and ending dates describe the actual transportation period.  

The following image shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines for transfer orders.  

![Central date-times in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers13.png "Central date-times in transfer planning")  

The example shows the following calculations:  

* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date  
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date  
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date  

## Safety lead time  

The **Default Safety Lead Time** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page and the related **Safety Lead Time** field on the **Item Card** page aren't included in transfer order calculations. However, the safety lead time does influence the total plan. The safety lead time affects the replenishment order (purchase or production) at the beginning of the transfer chain. That's the point where the items were put in the location from which they'll be transferred.  

![Elements of the transfer due date.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers14.png "Elements of the transfer due date")  

On the production order line, the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date.  

On the purchase order line, the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.  

## Reschedule  

When you reschedule a transfer line, the planning system finds the outbound part and changes the date-time.

> [!NOTE]
> If a lead time is defined, there'll be a gap between the shipment and the receipt. The lead time can consist of more elements, such as transportation time and warehouse handling time. On a time line, the planning system moves back in time while it balances the elements.  

![Changing the due date in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers15.png "Changing the due date in transfer planning")  

When you change the due date on a transfer line, the lead time must be calculated to update the outbound side of the transfer.  

## Serial and lot numbers in transfer chains  

If the demand uses serial or lot numbers, and you run the planning engine, it will create transfer orders. For more information about this concept, see Item Attributes. However, if serial or lot numbers are removed from the demand, the transfer orders still use the serial or lot numbers and planning will ignore them (not deleted).  

## Order-to-order links  

In this example, the BLUE SKU is set up with an **Order** reordering policy. The PINK and RED SKUs have the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy. Creating a sales order for 27 at location RED leads to a chain of transfers. The last transfer is at location BLUE, and it's reserved with binding. In this example, the reservations aren't hard reservations created by the planner at PINK location. The planning system creates the bindings. The important difference is that the planning system can change the latter.  

![Order-to-order links in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers16.png "Order-to-order links in transfer planning")  

If the demand is changed from 27 to 22, the planning system will lower the quantity through the chain. The binding reservation is also reduced.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. To learn more about permission settings, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. To learn more about custom page layouts, go to [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for specific users, you can enter **Navigation menu only** in the **Description** field. That setting excludes the profile from the list of available roles on the **My Settings** page.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one that has similar settings. When you copy a profile, you also copy page customizations, both user-created and those from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't available to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and sign in.

> [!Caution]
> Don't rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in. They might have to restart [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and sign in again.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. To learn more about user settings, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. To learn more about Role Explorer, go to [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles export to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. To learn more about exporting profiles, go to [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps in the **Import Profiles** assisted setup guide.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a security group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they're using.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization isn't relevant. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all personalized pages and the user they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. To learn more, go to [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. To learn more, go to [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).

# Import payroll transactions

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger. To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping.

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this functionality, an extension for payroll import must be installed and enabled. The Ceridian Payroll and the Quickbooks Payroll File Import extensions are pre-installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## To import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action. An assisted setup guide opens.
3. Follow the steps on the **Import Payroll Transactions** page.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   In the step about mapping the external payroll records to your G/L accounts, the mappings that you make will be remembered next time the same records are imported. This will save you time as you do not have to manually fill in the **Account No.** field in the general journal every time you have imported recurring payroll transactions.   

    When you choose the **OK** button in the assisted setup guide, the **General Journal** page is filled with lines representing the transactions that the payroll file contains and with the relevant accounts prefilled in the **G/L Account** fields according to mappings you made in the guide.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).

title: Set Up FA User-Defined Depreciation Method
description: In Business Central, you can apply a user-defined depreciation method for defining your asset's depreciation method on the Fixed Asset Card page.

# Set Up Fixed Assets with User-Defined Depreciation Methods

You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to set up the user-defined depreciation methods as described here.

For each user-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** page, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period (month, quarter, year, or accounting period). Then, when you assign a depreciation book with a user-defined method to a fixed asset, you must set the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields on the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset.  

The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  

*Depreciation Amount = (Depreciation % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*


> [!NOTE]  
> While the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is used to determine the time intervals, it is the **Depreciation Starting Date** that is used to determine the number of depreciation days. If the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is earlier than the **Depreciation Starting Date**, the percentage for the first period in the depreciation table will be only partially used when the program calculates the first depreciation. This means that the asset will not be completely depreciated by the end of the last period.

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset with a user-defined depreciation method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. Choose the **Related** action, and then choose **Fixed Asset**, and then **Depreciation Books**. This opens the **FA Depreciation Books** page.

   By default, some of the fields that need to be filled in per the instructions below are hidden, so you must display them. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).
4. In the field **Depreciation Method**, select **User-Defined**.
5. In the field **Depreciation Table Code**, select the **Depreciation Table** you want to use.
6. In the field **Depreciation Starting Date**, select the starting date for the depreciation calculation.
7. When you use a user-defined method, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field must be set to a date that is the same or earlier than the field **Depreciation Starting Date**. If you have selected a value in the **Period Length** field in the depreciation table, the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** must be the starting date of an accounting period.
8. Either fill in the field **No. of Depreciation Years** or the field **Depreciation Ending Date**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

## To set up user-defined depreciation methods

On the **Depreciation Table** page, you can set up user-defined depreciation methods. For example, you can set up depreciation based on number of units.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Tables**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Depreciation Table List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Depreciation Table Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Create Sum of Digits Table** function to define a depreciation table based on the *Sum of Digits* method.

With the *Sum of Digits* method, if a fixed asset is depreciated over 4 years, then the depreciation for each year is calculated in the following way:

Sum of Digits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Depreciation:

* Year 1 = 4/10  
* Year 2 = 3/10  
* Year 3 = 2/10  
* Year 4 = 1/10  

### Depreciation Based on Number of Units

This user-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. On the **Depreciation Tables** page, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period (month, quarter, year,or accounting period).  

### Example - User-defined Depreciation

You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes.  

You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes:  

* Year 1: 25%  
* Year 2: 38%  
* Year 3: 37%  

The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000, and the depreciable lifetime is five years. Depreciation is calculated annually.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |360 |-25,000.00 |75,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |37,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |0 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

In the previous example, both the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields would be set to 01/01/20 in the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset. If, however, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field contained 01/01/20 and the **Depreciation Starting Date** field contained 04/01/20, the result would be:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-18,750.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |42,250.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |6,250.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |90 |-6,250.00 |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

# Set up a sequence of workflow users

Before you can create approval workflows, you must set up the users who can submit requests and their approvers. For example, you can specify who receives a notification to act on a workflow step. You set up approval workflow participants on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

On the **Workflow User Groups** page, you can specify where a participant engages in an approval workflow by entering a number in the **Sequence No.** field. For example, you can specify that users engage in a sequential order, such as a chain of approvers. You can also specify a flat list of approvers by entering the same number. In the latter case, only one of the approvers must approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

## To set up a workflow user group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill in the fields on the first line, as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User Name**|Specify the user who takes part in a workflow.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).|
   |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can specify, for example, when the user approves relative to other approvers by setting up the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, sequence numbers are sequential for users in a workflow user group. However, multiple users can have the same sequence number. When that's the case, only one of the users must approve a request before the workflow goes to the next step. For example, if user A and user B are both number two in the sequence, the workflow goes to the step three when when either user A or user B approves the request.
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the workflow user group.

## Architecture

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The data source for Power BI reports is exposed as API pages and OData web services.

:::image type="content" source="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg" alt-text="Image alt text." lightbox="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg":::

Starting in February 2022, Power BI reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica. The database replica is part of the [read scale-out](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) capability in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This configuration frees up the main database for transactions, which enhances performance of the system. Connecting to the read-only database replica is an integral part of the Business Central online connector, and requires no extra setup on your part. All new reports will connect to the read-only database replica by default. Old reports will still use the main database. For more information, see [Business Central 2021 Release Wave 2 Plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-secondary-read-only-database-power-bi-reporting).

## General Flow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow for users when connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Power BI.

![Power BI workflow  for integration with Business Central.](./media/power-bi-flow-v2.svg)

1. User signs up for a Power BI account.
2. User connects to Power BI from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the license.
4. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deploys default reports to the Power BI service. This step only happens for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes reports in Power BI available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Default reports are automatically displayed in Power BI parts.
6. User creates a report in Power BI Desktop.
7. User publishes the report to the Power BI service. The reports are then available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Sharing Business Data from Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data, like a list of records, specific records, or documents. <!--, with others&mdash;even those people who don't have a Business Central license in some cases.-->

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions of Business Central.

## Copying a link

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and distribute it in other forms of media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser's address box.

When you paste the URL into a rich text editor like Word, Outlook, or Teams, instead of displaying the full URL, the link is given a more readable name that clearly indicates context of the target. The name and pattern vary depending on what page you're linking to. Consider the following examples:

|Pattern|Page example|Link name|
|-|-|-|
|List pages|**Items** list page | **Items**|
|List view|	**Open** filtered view on **Sales Orders** list|**Sales Orders - Open**|
| Single record|Item card showing single record|"Item Card - 1896 ∙ ATHENS Desk"|
|Draft records|	New customer card|**New - Customer card**|
|Company that uses badge|**Items** list page for company with badge **CRONUS**| **Items (CRONUS)**|

> [!TIP]
> A similar naming convention is used on browser tabs.

### Share data analysis
If you're viewing a page or query in the data analysis mode, you can share a specific analysis tab by selecting the down arrowhead on the tab, and then selecting **Copy link**. [Learn more about data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). 

### Modify the page link

After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what shows when the page opens. You can, for example, add filters or specify a different company.

[Learn more about the web client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

### About filtered lists

Using the filter pane on list pages, you can apply filters to narrow-down the records shown in the list. If you use the **Copy Link** action or copy the URL from the browser, the page link won't include your filter changes. Users that open the link see the full collection. The way to keep the filtering on a collection page link is to save the filtered page as a **View** first. Then, open the view and copy the link from there.

[Learn more about sorting, searching, and filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## Sharing to Teams

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Not Supported](media/x-icon.png) Business Central On-premises

Directly from most collection pages and details pages, you can send a link to the page to people, group chats or channels. For example, share a link to a filtered view of your records. If you've installed the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, the link will automatically expand into a compact card for you to include with your message. Recipients then select the link or card to open the page in Business Central.

[Learn more about sharing records and page links in Teams](across-working-with-teams.md).

## Sharing Through OneDrive

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Share** opens a page the let's you select who you want to share the file with. Recipients get a notification email to access the file from your OneDrive.

[Learn more about sharing files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).

## Opening in Excel

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

For list pages and lists embedded on a page, you can use the **Open in Excel** action. This action exports the list of records to an Excel workbook (.xlsx file), which you can share with others. In the workbook, you can also use the Share feature that's part of Excel.

[Learn more about viewing and editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).

## Sharing rows or tables

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

You can share one or more records in a list. Just select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy to your clipboard. Then paste what you copied into another application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. For example, copying three sales orders and pasting that into an email will display the orders in a nicely formatted table.

# Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry

This article compares the Posting Date on the Adjustment Value Entry with the Posting Date on the entry causing the running of the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job, in particular a Revaluation scenario and an Item Charge scenario.

The **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job will process your data depending on your scenario and configuration of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In this section, we describe two separate processes, and for each one we show the type of impact the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has on the data.

## Revaluation scenario

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

### To test the scenario

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps.

1. Create an **Item** called TEST with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Purchase  

     - Quantity = 100  

     - Unit Amount = 10  

3. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = December 20, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 2  

4. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = January 15, 2021  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 3  

5. Open an **Item Revaluation Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Applies-to Entry = select Purchase entry posted at step 2. The Posting Date of the revaluation will be the same as the entry it adjusts.  

     - Unit Cost (Revalued) = 40  

The following **Item Ledger** and **Value Entries** have been posted:  

**Item Ledger Entry - purchase**:  

|Entry Number  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

|377     |TEST|   2020-12-20    |318         |Negative Adjmt.         |Direct Cost         |T00002         |-2         |-20          |-20    |No         |0         |ITEMNL         |
|380     |TEST   |**2021-01-01**    |318         |Negative Adjmt.         |Direct Cost         |T04002         |0         |-60         |-60         |Yes         |377         |INVTADAMT         |

**Item Ledger Entry - negative adjustment, Step 4**  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |TEST      |2021-01-15   |Negative Adjmt.  |T00003         |-3         |-120         | 0        |

**Value Entries**  

|Entry Number  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Number Entry Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Posted to G/L  |Adjustment  |Applies to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|378     |TEST|   2021-01-15    |319         |Negative Adjmt.         |Direct Cost         |T00003         |-3         |-30          |-30    |No         |0         |ITEMNL         |
|381     |TEST   |**2021-01-15**    |319         |Negative Adjmt.         |Direct Cost         |T04003         |0         |-90         |-90         |Yes         |378         |INVTADAMT         |

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job has recognized a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments.  

**Review of Posting Dates on created adjustment value entries:** The earliest allowed Posting Date the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has to relate to is January 1, 2021 as stated in the General Ledger Setup.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 3:** assigned Posting Date is January 1, provided by General Ledger Setup. The Posting Date of the Value Entry in the scope for adjustment is December 20, 2020. According to the General Ledger Setup, the date is not within the allowed posting date range. Therefore the Posting Date stated in the Allow Posting From field in the General Ledger Setup is assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 4:** assigned Posting Date is January 15. The Value Entry in scope of adjustment has Posting Date January 15, which is within the allowed posting date range according to General Ledger Setup.  

The adjustment made for the Negative Adjustment in step 3 causes discussion. The favorable Posting Date for the Adjustment Value Entry would have been December 20 or at least within December as the revaluation causing the change in COGS was posted in December.  

To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3, the General Ledger Setup, Allow Posting From field, needs to state a date in December.  

### Conclusion

With the experience gained in this scenario, when considering the most suitable setup for an allowed posting date range for a company, you might want to consider the following. As long as you allow changes in the inventory value to be posted in a period, such as December in this case, the setup that the company uses for allowed posting date ranges should be aligned with this decision. The Allow Posting From in the General Ledger Setup, stating December 1, would allow the revaluation made in December to be forwarded to affected outbound entries in the same period.  

User groups not allowed to post in December but in January, which was probably intended to be limited by the General Ledger Setup in this scenario, should instead be addressed via the User setup.  

## Item charge scenario  

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting to = Empty  

### To test the scenario  

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps:

1.  Create an **Item** Charge with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 1234  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 100  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

3.  Create a new **Sales Order** with the following values:  

     - Sell-to Customer No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 16, 2020  

     On the Sales Order Line:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Unit Price = 135  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

4.  Enter values for the **General Ledger Setup** page:  

     - Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

    -  Allow Posting To = blank  

5.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = January 2, 2021  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 2345  

     On the Purchase Order Line:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 3  

     - Assign the Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2.  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

6.  On work date January 3, a purchase invoice arrives containing an additional item charge to the purchase made in step 2. This invoice has document date December 30, and is therefore posted with Posting Date December 30, 2020.  

     Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 30, 2020  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 3456  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 2  

     Assign Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

Inventory Valuation report is printed as of Date December 31, 2020

![Content of the Inventory Valuation report.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost13.png "Content of the Inventory Valuation report")

**Summary of scenario:**  

The described scenario ends up with an Inventory Valuation report demonstrating Quantity = 0 while the Value = 2. The Item charge posted in step 6 is part of the Inventory Increase value of December while the Inventory Decrease of the same period is not affected.  

Having the General Ledger Setup stating Allow Posting From January 1 was a good thing for the first Item charge. The costs of the Inventory Increase and Decrease was recorded in the same period. For the second Item charge however, the General Ledger Setup causes the change in COGS to be recognized in the period after.  

**Conclusion:**  

It is a challenge to get the Inventory Valuation report to demonstrate Quantity = 0 while the Value <> 0. In this case it is also more difficult to express the optimal settings, having purchase invoices arriving the same day but addressing different periods or even fiscal years. Crossing to a new fiscal year usually requires some planning and as part of that the insight into Adjust Cost – Item entries process, recognizing COGS, is to be considered.  

In this scenario one option could have been to have the General Ledger Setup, field Allow Posting From, stating a date in December for a couple of more days and the posting of the first item charge postponed to allow all costs for the previous period/fiscal year to be recognized for the period they belong to first, having the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job run and thereafter move the allowed posting date to the new period\/fiscal year. The first item charge with posting date January 2 could then be posted.

# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Business Central starting from **2024 release wave 1**.  

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals or purchase documents, and recalculation of emissions to CO2 equivalent. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints; calculation using formulas are available for use only when using sustainability journals.   

> [!NOTE]
> This solution is still in early stages of development and new set of features will be added with the next release.  

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Record emission data directly working with purchase documents.
- Record purchase of carbon credit using purchase documents.
- Calculate internal carbon fee.
- Recalculate emission of all gasses to CO2 equivalent using formulas.
- Post emission entries (and carbon credits) to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions.
- Set scorecards and goals and compare them with baseline and targeted values.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
- Use financial reports for cross functional reporting.

# Entering data

Many general features help you enter data easier, faster, and more precisely. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table.|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists.|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as a pop-up window.|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

Select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:

- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set the focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set the focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.  

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Several keyboard shortcuts let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, go to [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing **Enter** and the ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, go to [Quick Entry shortcuts for fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and tricks

The following list provides helpful information about using Quick Entry:

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory, so it's good to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry, so initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want to change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means the field must be filled in to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't required to fill in the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding data as you type

When you start to type characters in a field, you'll see a dropdown list that shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that's available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- **Lookup**: Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- **Dropdown**: Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and pasting FAQ fields and lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or an Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS).

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above and paste it into the current row, select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, go to [Copy and paste FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering line items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5 percent. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on line items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the line items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the focus on and off

To focus on line items, select anywhere in the line items part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking across multiple pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time.
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may prevent the new window from opening. In this case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For more information, go to [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, go to [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering quantities by calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering negative numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. As an example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering dates and times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, go to [Work with calendar dates and times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manual date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, go to [Configure Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date—for example, C123101.|  

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering combined datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different from the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings** page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language of **French (France)**. For more information, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> On occasion you may want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Set up validation of purchase amounts

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

You can validate the total amount on purchase invoices and credit memos before you post the documents. You can turn on the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates the total amount when you post the document. The total amount of the purchase lines must equal the amount including VAT and the VAT amount. To validate the amount automatically, you must enter the document amount including VAT and the document amount VAT on the **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo** page.  

If you have only one purchase line, or several purchase lines with the same VAT percentage, the correct document amount VAT is calculated automatically when you add the purchase lines and the document amount including VAT. If you have several purchase lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually change the document amount VAT value.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

You can turn on this option only if the purchase invoice or purchase credit memo has:  

- A minimum of one purchase line.  
- The quantity field specified.  

## To set up validation of total amounts for purchase documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Totals on Purch. Inv./CM.**|Recalculate the totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos. Depending on how many documents you have, the recalculation can take some time.|  
    |**Check Doc. Total Amounts**|Verify the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoices and credit memos.|  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# Change which features are displayed

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is designed to help you run your business regardless of the size and complexity. At the core of the product, you find essential features, such as financial reporting, sales, purchasing, and inventory management. As business complexity increases, you can turn on functionality for manufacturing and service management, for example.

You can define the product complexity level, and thereby which features the company's users get access to, by changing the **Experience** setting on the **Company Information** page. Note that the experience setting can also be changed by adding certain extensions from AppSource. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Essentials** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|
| **Premium** |Shows all actions and fields for all business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management.|

The experiences that can be selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reflect the solution licenses, called plans, that are defined for the product. For information about the Essentials and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264940) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 marketing site. See also the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264939).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Users of type Team Member, Internal Admin, External Accountant, and Delegated Admin can be assigned a different plan than other users in the solution. Only users of type Evaluation or Premium can change the value in the **Experience** field from Essentials to Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, a user with the Premium plan can sign in to a company that's using the Essentials plan. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. The same isn't true in the opposite direction. Users who have the Essentials plan can't sign in to a company that's using the Premium plan.

Prior to defining a company's experience setting, you define users' access to specific functions and pages by assigning permission sets. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The **Experience** setting applies to all users in a company, but each user can personalize their own experience further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Enabling premium features after upgrading a plan

Users are assigned to plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center in connection with the general work to create the Business Central users. For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To update plan changes in users groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

When you have made a change to users plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center, such as assigned more users to the Premium plan, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change.

1. Sign is as an administrator.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Users** page, choose the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action.

### To select the Premium experience

You can now proceed to select the new experience.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Information** page, on the **User Experience** FastTab, select Premium  in the **Experience** field.

## Help assumes the Premium experience

All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements.

# Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations

You might want to move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Move extra items to and from a production area. 

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Bin Mandatory** setup toggle is turned on, but not **Directed Pick and Put-away** you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* On the **Internal Movement** page.
* On the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

## Internal movements

The **Internal Movements** page lets you specify Take and Place lines when there isn't a demand from a source document. The Internal Movement page is like a worksheet for organizing things. You can't process the actual movement directly from it. When a line is filled in, use the **Create Inventory Movement** action to send the line to the **Inventory Movement** page, which is where you process and register the movement.

### To move items as an internal movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Internal Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New** action. Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the movement takes place.  

    If the location is your default location as a warehouse employee, the location code is added automatically.  
4. In the **To Bin Code** field, enter the code for the bin that you want to move the items to.

    For example, in production, the bin could be the open shop floor bin defined on the location card or work center.  
5. In the **Due Date** field, enter the date by which to complete the movement.  
6. On each line, fill in the fields as necessary. Internal movement documents have one line per movement. The line contains both the take and the place actions.
7. Choose the **Item No.** field to open the **Bin Contents List** page. Select the item to move based on its availability in bins. You can also choose the **Get Bin Contents** action to fill the internal movement lines based on your filters.  

    After you select the item, the **From Bin Code** field is automatically filled in according to the selected bin content. You can choose any bin where the item is available. The **Item No.** and **From Bin Code** fields are related. Changing the value in one field might change the value in the other.  

    The **To Bin Code** field is filled in with the value you entered on the header. You can change it on the line to any other bin code that isn’t blocked or dedicated for special purposes. Learn more at [The Dedicated field](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md#the-dedicated-field).  

8. After you define which bins you want to move the items from and to, enter the quantity to move in the **Quantity** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The quantity must be available in the bin specified in the **From Bin Code** field.  

9. When you're ready to process the movement, choose the **Create Inventory Movement** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After you create the movement, the internal movement lines are deleted.  

Perform the rest of the unplanned movement on the **Inventory Movement** page in the same way as you would for a movement based on source documents.

### To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record the movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin where the items must be picked from is where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the move and enter the information for the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following happens during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries indicate that the quantity is transferred from the take bins to the place bins.

## To move items with the item reclassification journal

Instead of using movement documents, you can record movements by reclassifying bin codes on items. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Movements posted with reclassification journals don't make the movement documents ready to move.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On each journal line, define the bins to move the items from and to by filling in the **Bin Code** and the **New Bin Code** fields.  

    1. To move a bin's entire contents to another bin, choose the **Get Bin Contents** action.  
    2. Use the filters to find the bin that contains the items you'd like to move, and then choose **OK**. The journal lines are filled with the contents of the bin.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on each journal line.
4. Post the reclassification journal.

# Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger

This article explains how to manage the chart of sustainability accounts (CoSA), categories and subcategories, and details about sustainability ledger entries.

## Chart of sustainability accounts

The CoSA forms the foundational structured list that is used to record all emissions, water, and waste data. It serves as a framework that categorizes and organizes sustainability accounts based on their attributes, such as the scope or other groupings. Each account is typically assigned a unique code or number for easy reference and tracking. It has the same structure as a traditional chart of accounts but is customized specifically to monitor sustainability-related data and metrics in an organization.  

Users can add sustainability account categories and sustainability account subcategories to define how the system behaves. In this way, they can select dedicated emissions, water, or waste for tracking, emission factors, formulas, and similar configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, there are three emission scopes:
>
> - **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
> - **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
> - **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.
> - **Out of scope** is for situations where you can't assign a specific emission to the transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select **Water/Waste** as one of options in the **Emission Scope** when they want to post transactions related to the water and waste management.  

From the CoSA, you can do things such as:

- View reports that show sustainability ledger entries and balances.
- Open the sustainability account card to add or change settings.
- View the category and subcategory for the account.
- View separate balances for each emission for a single account.
- Add single or multiple dimensions to each account and set dimension filters.

You can add, change, or delete sustainability accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

### Add or change accounts

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Sustainability Accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Chart of Sustainability Accounts** page, you can open each sustainability account, and then add or change settings. Hover over a field to read a short description.

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must set the **Totaling** field.

For accounts of the **End-Total** type, the **Indent** action automatically sets the **Totaling** field. After you set up all the accounts, select the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action to run the **Indent** action and set the **Totaling** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action overwrites the value of all fields for **End-Total** accounts. Therefore, if you entered definitions in the **Totaling** field for **End-Total** accounts before you ran the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action, you must enter them again after you run it.  

### Delete accounts

You can delete a sustainability account. However, you must first make sure that no ledger entries are associated with it. Business Central prevents you from deleting a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

## Account categories

You must add a sustainability account category to each sustainability account to define how the system behaves. You can select emission scopes (gas, water, or waste), dedicated to type of transaction to track, formulas, and similar configurations.  

To review sustainability account categories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Categories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Categories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. In the **Emission Scope** field, select one of the scope options related to gas emissions or water or waste intensity.
5. Select the gas emissions, or water or waste intensity, that you want to track. Currently, the following options are available: **CO2**, **CH4**, **N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity**. You can select any combination that you want to track, but you must select at least one of them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose one of gas emissions scopes as the **Emission Scope** you can select the **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**, but you can't select the **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**. Also, if you select **Water/Waste** as the **Emission Scope**, you can select only the  **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**, but you can't select **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**.

6. In the **Calculation Foundation** field, select the calculation foundation (formula) to use for emission calculations if you don't know the accurate emission or water or waste intensity amount.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the formulas in the **Calculation Foundation** field aren't enough, you can extend the field and add more calculations for use in sustainability journals.

7. If you selected **Custom** in the **Calculation Foundation** field, you can configure a custom description in the **Custom Value** field.

If you set the **Calculation Foundation** field, the following table explains how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates emissions based on the option that you selected. In the table, **EF** represents the **Emission Factor** value that you can configure on the **Sustainability Account Subcategory** page.

| Emission Type | Calculation Foundation | Formula | Comment |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Scope 1** | | | |
| Stationary combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for boilers, heaters, thermal oxidizers, and so on. |
| Mobile combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| | | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| Fugitive emissions | Installation | *Emission* = *Installation multiplier* &times; *Custom Amount* &divide; 100 &times; *Time Factor* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Assembly losses, annual leak rate, and so on. |
| **Scope 2** | | | |
| Utility providers | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Electricity* &times; *EF* | *Fuel/Electricity* = Electricity quantity, steam quantity, heating unit, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Thermal unit, ton-hour, and so on. |
| **Scope 3** | | | |
| Purchased goods and services, and capital goods | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Cost (GL), and so on. |
| Upstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Downstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Waste generated in operations and end-of-life treatment of sold products | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Waste |
| Business travel and employee commuting | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of the used company car, rental car, train, flight, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Hotel stays |
| | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel spent in the company car, rental car, and so on. This is the only formula used for water or waste intensity calculation. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note applies to the formulas for **Upstream Transportation and Distribution** and **Downstream Transportation and Distribution** when you use the tons-of-cargo calculation model. While you can adapt the formulas, we recommend against using the exact number of tons of cargo as a multiplier. Instead, consult your sustainability advisor to ensure accurate calculations because emissions don't increase linearly with weight. A more accurate approach is to use the **Load Factor**, which represents the percentage of the truck's total capacity utilized (by weight or volume). The load factor can be calculated as **Weight of Cargo** / **Maximum Load Capacity of Truck**. But always confirm with your sustainability expert before you finalize calculations.

## Account subcategories

You must add a sustainability account subcategory to each sustainability account. This subcategory defines the emission factors that the formulas use, based on the emission tracking choice in the sustainability account category.

To review sustainability account subcategories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Subcategories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Subcategories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. Based on the gas emissions that you track in the sustainability account category and connect this subcategory to, you can also set one or more emission factors:

    - **Emission Factor CO2** – The emission factor for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor CH4** – The emission factor for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor N2O** – The emission factor for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission.
    - **Water Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Water.
    - **Discharged Into Water Factor** - The intensity factor for Discharged Into Water.
    - **Waste Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Waste.

5. If the subcategory is related to renewable energy, select the **Renewable Energy** field. However, you can select this field only if it's related to gas emissions and to water or waste.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Import Data** and **Import From** fields are intended for integration with external systems that are used to collect emission factors. However, in **2024 release wave 1**, these fields can't be used as a feature by default.

You can have more than one account subcategory for a sustainability account, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting.  

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you want to use one account for cars, but you have different types of cars with different emission factors. You can set up one account and create account subcategories for the different emission factors. When you work in a sustainability journal, you can change your account subcategory based on the car type.  

## Sustainability ledger entries

The sustainability ledger stores the history of all posted sustainability transactions and organizes all emission data according to the CoSA. When you post a sustainability journal, the data is recorded there. All active reports are generated based on the sustainability ledger entries.

To open this ledger for a specific account, use the **Ledger Entries** action on the **Chart of Sustainability Account** page. To open all the ledger entries, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, and then select the related link. Hover over a field to read a short description.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you post your data to the sustainability ledger, you can't delete it. If you made a mistake, you can post a reverse transaction that has the same details but uses the negative sign for the amount.

> [!NOTE]
> If you posted entries before enabling **CO<sub>2</sub>e** in the **Emission Fees** page, you can run the **Update Carbon Fees** action from the **Emission Fees** page to recalculate carbon equivalent to in all transactions in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

# Viewing table information

The **8700 Table Information** page provides information about the number of records in all system and business tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and how much data each table contains.

This information is useful for troubleshooting performance problems because it shows the distribution of data sizes across tables.

## View table information

To open this page, select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Table Information**, and then choose the related link.

The following table describes the information provided for each table:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Company Name|The name of the company, if any, that the table belongs to.|
|Table Name|The name of the table.|
|Table No.|The ID of the table.|
|No. of Records|The total number of records stored in the table.|
|Record Size|The average record size in KB/record. The value is calculated using the following formula: 1024(Size)/(No. of Records). |
|Size (KB)|The total amount of space the table occupies in the database. This value is the sum of the values in the Data Size and Index Size fields.|
|Data Size (KB)|How much space the data in the base table occupies in the database.|
|Index Size (KB)|How much space the table indexes (keys) on the base table occupy in the database.|
|Compression|The type of compression, **Row**, **Page**, or **None** that is applied to the table in the database. To learn more, go to [Data compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression?).|

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete data in a table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starts several processes behind the scenes to make sure that everything is cleaned up in your database. The values on the Table Information page don't update until those processes are complete, which can take a while. The amount of time it takes can vary, depending on the size of your database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Table Information** page shows data and index (key) sizes for the base table and extension table. It doesn't include the sizes for *indexed views* used to maintain SIFT totals. Furthermore, the sum of table sizes doesn't match the total capacity used because it displays the data size, not the actual allocated size. Allocated space is always larger than used space to avoid having to allocate space on every insert, which would limit performance significantly.

# Exchanging Data Electronically
You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners.

In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Data Exchange Framework is used in processes such as exchanging electronic documents, importing and exporting bank files, and updating exchange rates for currencies. For more information, see [About the Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md).

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by specifying the data to exchange, and how to exchange it. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the regional SEPA standards (Single Euro Payments Area) for importing SEPA bank statements (CAMT format). For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).  

 The SEPA CAMT standard itself has local variations. Therefore, you may have to modify the generic data exchange definition (represented by the **SEPA CAMT** code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page) to adapt it to a local variation of the standard. The following tables show the element-to-field mapping for tables 81, 273, and 274 in the SEPA CAMT implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

 For information about creating or adjusting a data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

## CAMT data mapping to fields in the General Journal table (81)  

|Element Path|Message Element|Data Type|Description|Negative-Sign Identifier|Field No.|Field Name|

 Elements in the **Ntry** node that are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but not mapped to any fields are stored in the **Posting Exch. Column Def** table. Users can view these elements from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, **Payment Application**, and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages by choosing the **Bank Statement Line Details** action. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In an import of CAMT bank statements, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] expects each transaction to be unique, which means that the **Transaction ID** field that comes from the *Stmt/Ntry/NtryDtls/TxDtls/Refs/EndToEndId* tag in the CAMT file, must be unique within the open bank account reconciliation. If the information is not present, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the payment. If an earlier bank reconciliation on the same bank account was posted with the same transaction ID as on the current import, the current transaction will not automatically reconcile but can still be imported.

# About the Data Exchange Framework

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.

 The following diagrams show the architecture of the data exchange framework.  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Import.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_import.png)  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Export.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_export.png)  

## Electronic documents

As an alternative to emailing business documents as file attachments, you can send and receive them electronically. An "electronic document" is a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Trading partners exchange electronic documents through external document exchange services. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. Currently, Avalara and Pagero exchange services are pre-configured and ready to be set up for your company (Microsoft will support more exchange services in near future). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you must check if they're already delivered in your localization to create new data exchange definitions.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

To send, for example, a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, read this [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments.md). The data conversion and sending of the PEPPOL sales invoice are performed by dedicated codeunits and XMLports.  

To receive, for example, an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, read the following [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). You can either set up the Job Queue feature to process such files regularly or you can start the process manually. For both sales and purchase processes, first, [you must set up](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) various master data, such as services, company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when you convert data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The receiving and data conversion of PEPPOL invoices are performed by the Data Exchange Framework.  

To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you process it the same way as you would when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. The receiving and conversion of electronic documents from OCR are performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition.  

## Bank files

The formats of files for exchanging bank data with business management applications vary depending on the supplier of the file and the country or region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import and export of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank files. Additionally, the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension lets you connect to a AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension provided by an external provider, AMC Consult. For more information, see [Make Payments with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the Data Exchange Framework.  

To export SEPA credit transfers, you choose **Export Payments to File** button on the **Payment Journal** page and then upload the file to process the payments in your bank. First you must set up various master data, such as bank account, vendors, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by a dedicated codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Credit Transfer** bank export/import setup. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the export, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension - Credit Transfer** data exchange definition.  

 To export SEPA direct debit instructions, you choose the **Export Direct Debit File** button on the **Direct Debit Collections** page and then send to your bank to automatically collect the involved customer payments. First you must set up bank accounts, customers, direct-debit mandates, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by dedicated a codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Direct Debit** bank export/import setup.  

 To import SEPA bank statements, you choose the Import Bank Statement button in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages and then you proceed to apply each bank statement entry to payments or bank ledger entries, manually or automatically. First you must set up bank accounts. The import and data conversion of SEPA bank data is performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the import, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension – Bank Statement** data exchange definition.  

 In addition, the local versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support various other file formats for importing and exporting bank data, payroll transactions, and other data. For more information, see the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) landing page for your country/region in the Help.  

## Currency exchange rates

You can set up an external service to keep your for currency exchange rates up to date. The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition. Accordingly, the **Exch. Rate Update Setup Card** page is a condensed view of the **Data Exchange Definition** page for the data exchange definition in question.  

For all exchanges of data in XML files, you can prepare the data exchange setup by loading the related XML schema file on the **XML Schema Viewer** page. Here you select the data elements that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  and then you either initialize a data exchange definition or generate an XMLport.

## Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the Data Exchange Framework for Intrastat reporting where you can easily create timestamped files in different formats for export. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains prepared formats for localized countries/regions and for default version. But you can change the out-of-box report or make your own.

# Add Business Central tab in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In Teams, tabs appear at the top of channels and chats, giving participants quick access to pertinent information. This article explains different ways to add a tab that displays [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

## About Business Central tabs

A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab provides a focused view of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list and card pages. The tab doesn't display the full [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client. There's no browser border, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] banner (for example with Tell Me, search, help) or top navigation menu&mdash;just page content and its actions. The content is interactive, meaning that you can select actions and links, change data, and more. You're limited to what you see and can do by the same permissions assigned to your account in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Learn more about who can view the content of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab in [Who can see the content of a tab?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#who-can-view).

> [!TIP]
> Are you a developer? You can also add tabs programmatically using the Microsoft Graph API. Learn more in [Add Business Central Tabs to Teams](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-for-teams-tabs).  

## Prerequisites

To add a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

To view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab that was added by another participant in the channel or chat, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license or limited access to Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license only. Learn more in [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

## Add tab using recommended content

Use these steps to add a tab by choosing what to display from a readily available list of recommended content that's based your role center&mdash;without leaving Teams. Learn more about the content that you can choose from in [Where does the recommended content come from?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#where-does-the-recommended-content-come-from).

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon and wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window.png)

3. The **Choose from content recommended for** option shows the company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you working with. If you want to show content from another company, select the current company, then use the **Environment** and **Company** options to specify company you want to work with.
4. Select down arrow in the **Tab content** option and choose the content that you want to display.

   <!-- The list shows all pages that are bookmarked on your role center in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the content that you can choose from, see [Where does the recommended content come from?](teams-faq.md#recommended-content).-->
5. Some pages may include different views, which are variations of the page that's filtered to show specific data. To change the view for the content, select the down arrow for the **Preferred view** option and choose the view from the list.

   Learn more in [Save and Personalize Views](ui-views.md).
6. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
7. Select **Save**.

## Add tab using a page link

Another way to add a tab by using a link (URL) to the page that you want to show. This way is useful when you want to display a specific [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record or a list page that isn't bookmarked on your role center.

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon.
3. Wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear, then select **Paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link instead** option.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and highlights the link option](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-page-link.png)
4. Go to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and open the page that you want to display in the tab.
5. Copy the link to the page.

   There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. The other way is to copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar. Learn more in [Sharing Business Central Records and Page Links](across-working-with-teams.md).

6. Go back to Teams and paste the link in the **URL** box.
7. In the **Tab name** box, enter a name that displays on the tab.
8. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
9. Select **Save**.

## Change a tab and its content

After a tab has been added, you can make certain changes to the tab. For example, you can rename the tab, move it, and remove it. You find these actions in the tab options that are available by selecting the down arrow on the tab.

![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and the tab options menu](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-options-2.png)

As for the content of a tab, you can modify the data, if you have permission. If you change the data, others won't see the changes until they leave the tab and come back. The same is true for you if someone else makes changes to data. You can't change the page that displays on the tab, so just remove the tab and add another one the suits.

You can also change your view of the page and its data, like sorting and switching the layout between list and tile views. When you make these kinds of changes, they won't affect what others see. They see what you originally posted, until they make similar changes themselves.

# Analyzing report data with Excel and XML

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

As a developer or advanced user, it helps to inspect the data that is generated for a given report dataset while you create new reports or modify existing ones. To support this capability, you can export a report dataset as raw data to an Excel workbook or XML file&mdash;directly. In Excel, for example, you can then do ad-hoc analysis of the data and diagnose issues.

## Get started

To export a report dataset to an Excel workbook or XML file, open the report in the client, then in the request page, select **Send to** > **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** or **XML Document**. The file downloads to your device.

## More about Excel (data only)

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports the report results and the criteria used to generate them&mdash;but it doesn't include the report layout. The Excel file includes the full dataset, as raw data, arranged in rows and columns. All data columns of the report's dataset are included, regardless of whether they're used in the report layout.

Once you have the Excel file, you can start analyzing the data. For example, you could filter the data and use Power Pivot to display it.

Each time you export results, a new worksheet is created. Using the **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option, you can run the same report and reuse formatting changes. For example, for Power Pivot, you can run the report again for another time period, copy the results to the worksheet, and then refresh the worksheet. You can also find a reporting app on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't export a report that has more than 1,048,576 rows or 16,384 columns. With Business Central on-premises, the maximum number of exported rows might be even less. Business Central Server includes a configuration setting, called **Max Data Rows Allowed to Send to Excel**, for decreasing the limit from the maximum value. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General) or contact your administrator.

## For administrators

- **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** was introduced as an optional feature in the 2021 release wave 1, update 18.3. To give users access to this feature when running 2021 release wave 1, enable the **Save report dataset to Microsoft Excel Document** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management). In 2021 release wave 2, this feature became permanent.

- To use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, user accounts need the **Allow Action Export Report Dataset To Excel** permission. You can give users this permission by assigning either the **Troubleshooting Tools** or **Export Report Excel** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md)  

## For developers and advanced users

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports all columns, including columns that hold filters and formatting instructions for other values. Here are a few points of interest:

- Binary data in a field, like an image, isn't exported.

  In columns that hold binary data, fields include the text **Binary data ({0} bytes)**, where **{0}** indicates the number of bytes.
- The Excel file also includes the **Report Metadata** worksheet.

  This worksheet shows the filters applied to the report and general report properties, like the name, ID, and extension details. The filters are shown in the **Filter (DataItem::Table::FilterGroupNo::FieldName)** column. The filters in this column include filters set on the report's request page. It also includes filters defined in AL code, for example, by the [DataItemLink property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemlink-reports-property) and [DataItemTableView property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemtableview-property).

# Service Order Status and Repair Status

The **Status** field on the **Service Order** page and the service item repair status, which is represented by the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Order** page have a certain relationship in Service Management. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

This article explains how bank account reconciliation assist can help you reconcile bank transactions with ledger entries in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## About bank account reconciliation assist

Bank account reconciliation assist is a set of AI-powered features that help you reconcile bank accounts. It offers two distinct tasks through Copilot:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    As you might already know, the **Match Automatically** button on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page automatically matches most bank transactions with ledger entries. We refer to this operation as *automatch*. Although automatch works well, the algorithms that it uses can sometimes result in many unmatched transactions. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum that you have registered as individually paid invoices, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple bank ledger entries.

    [Learn more about this task](#reconcile-bank-accounts-with-copilot).

- Suggested general ledger (G/L) accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot compares the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggests the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

    [Learn more about this task](#post-unmatched-bank-transaction-amounts-to-suggested-gl-accounts).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The **Bank account reconciliation** capability is activated. An administrator must complete this task. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with bank account reconciliation in Business Central. Learn more in [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

## Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

<!-- Similar to the **Match Automatically** capability on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, Bank account reconciliation assist can also automatically matches transactions in banks statements with bank entries. The difference is that **Match Automatically** uses a native rules-based algorithm, while Bank account reconciliation assist is based AI technology though Copilot. Bank account reconciliation assist is intended to supplement the **Match Automatically** capability. While **Match Automatically** is fairly successful at matching transactions, there are some instances where it can't&mdash;which is where Bank account reconciliation assist comes. By using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action on **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, you can find even more matches.-->

Copilot in bank account reconciliation is intended to supplement the automatch operation. Therefore, when you use Copilot, the automatch operation runs first to make the initial matches. Then Copilot runs to try to match transactions that the automatch operation didn't handle.

You can use two approaches to reconcile bank accounts with Copilot:

- Use Copilot to start a new reconciliation on a bank account, directly from the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list.
- Use Copilot on a new or existing reconciliation on a **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card.

# [From the Bank Account Reconciliation list](#tab/fromlist)

For this approach, you create and reconcile a new bank account reconciliation from scratch. This approach requires that you select the bank account. If the bank account isn't linked to an online account, you must also import the bank statement file.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Start a Copilot prompt action** > **Reconcile** to open the **Reconcile with Copilot** window.
1. Set the **Perform reconciliation for this bank account** field to the bank account that you want to reconcile.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot window for reconciling from scratch.](media/reconcile-bank-accounts-new-copilot.svg)

1. If the selected bank account isn't linked to an online bank account, you must import the bank statement file. To import the file, either select the value in the **Use transaction data from** field or select the paper clip button next to the **Generate** button. Then use **Select the file to import** to import the bank statement file by either dragging it from your device or browsing your device.
1. To reconcile with Copilot, select **Generate**.

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.

# [From a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card](#tab/fromcard)

For this approach, you use Copilot either on a new bank account reconciliation that you manually create or by editing an existing reconciliation.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Follow one of these steps:

    - Select **New** to start a new reconciliation. Add the statement lines, either manually or by using **Suggest Lines** action to get a copy of the bank ledger entries as a starting point.
    - Select and open an existing reconciliation in the list.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card, select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Reconcile with Copilot** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot button on a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.
---

### Review, save, or discard proposed matches

After you run Copilot, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the detailed results, including any proposed matches. At this point, no match that Copilot proposed has been saved. Therefore, you have an opportunity to inspect the proposals and save or discard them as you want.

![Screenshot that shows proposed matches in the Reconcile with Copilot window.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-window.png)

The **Reconcile with Copilot** window is divided into two sections. The upper section provides some general details about the result. The lower section, **Match proposals**, lists the matches that Copilot proposed.

The following table describes the fields in the upper section.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Auto-matched | The number of bank statement lines that the automatch operation matched. Select the value to view the reconciliation card. |
| Copilot matched | The number of bank statement lines that Copilot proposed matches for. You can view details of the matches in the **Match proposals** section. |
| Statement Ending Balance | The ending balance that is shown on the bank statement that you're reconciling with. |
| Post if fully applied | Turn on this option to automatically post the bank account reconciliation when all lines (100 percent) are matched and you select **Keep it**. |

In the **Match proposals** section, review the proposed matches line by line. Then take the appropriate action:

- To discard a single proposed match, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**.
- To discard all proposed matches and close the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
- To automatically post the fully matched reconciliation when you save it, turn on the **Post if fully applied** option.
- To save the matches that are currently shown in the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select **Keep it**.

## Post unmatched bank transaction amounts to suggested G/L accounts

This section explains how to use Copilot to post unreconciled bank account statement line amounts (as specified in the **Difference** field) to a G/L account. This task can be done only from an existing reconciliation.

1. Go to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list, and open the existing reconciliation that includes the unreconciled lines.

    This step gives you a clear view of any unreconciled bank statement lines that must be transferred to the G/L account.

1. In the **Bank statement lines** pane, identify the unmatched bank statement lines, and select one or more lines that you want to reconcile.

    Copilot focuses on the selected lines to post new payments to the G/L account.

1. Select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Post Difference to G/L Account** to start the process.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Post Difference to G/L Account button on the Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-transfer-gl-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposals for posting new payments.

1. After Copilot finishes generating proposals, the **Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts** window appears.

    The **Match proposals** section of this window shows the proposals. The experience resembles the experience for reconciling with Copilot.

    ![Screenshot that shows Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts window.](media/bank-reconciliation-gl-transfer-proposed-matches-v2.png)

    To post the differences as regular journal entries, you must specify the general journal template and batch to use. This allows you to reverse the transaction if you need to later.

1. Review the proposals line by line to ensure the accuracy of the suggested payments for posting.

    - If you drill down on the proposal by selecting it in the list, you're taken to a list of accounts. From there, you can select another account. You can do this type of manual correction only when you use the **Post Difference to G/L Account** flow, not the matching flow.
    - If you select **Save** next to a proposal, you can add the mapping to the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. Then, the next time that this text appears during matching, it's mapped to the proposed account.

1. Discard or save proposals.

    - To discard a specific proposal, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**. To discard all proposals and close Copilot, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
    - If the proposals meet your requirements, and you want to save them, select **Keep it**.

         This step confirms the transfer of the currently selected proposals from the bank account ledger to the G/L account. It posts new payments to the proposed G/L accounts and applies corresponding lines to the resulting bank account ledger entries.

# Production Scrap (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Production Scrap** report presents important key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Scrap %** and **Scrap Quantity by Work Center**, **Machine Center**, **Source No.**, and **Production Order**.

The **Production Order Scrap %** KPI card highlights the relationship between **Finished Quantity** and **Scrap Quantity** to help clarify the drivers behind the production order scrap percent.

The **Scrap Quantity Over Time** chart shows how scrap quantity changes over time. This chart allows you to identify trends in production scrap as processes change.

Work center and machine center statistics display in the KPI Bar. **Work Center Scrap %** and **Machine Center Scrap %** are derived from the **Work Center Scrap** and **Work Center Output** respectively. These figures help you understand the efficiency of your production facilities at a glance.

The **Scrap % by Production Order** chart gives you an easy way to compare scrap rates across different productions orders. Cross filter this report by the **Scrap Quantity vs. Expected Scrap Quantity by Source No.** chart to identify which production orders contribute to the scrap rate.

The **Scrap Quantity by Scrap Code** visual allows you to quickly compare and analyze why scrap occurred.

Used together, these visuals help uncover where and why waste is happening, so you can take steps to reduce it.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/production-scrap-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Production Scrap Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/production-scrap-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing managers.

COOs use the report to measure the effectiveness of manufacturing processes and resources. By analyzing the capacity scrap quantity, you can identify areas that need improvement and optimize resource use. For example, a high scrap rate at a particular location might indicate a problem with the machinery or the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can reduce waste and improve efficiency, leading to cost savings.

For manufacturing managers, this report reveals important measures about capacity scrap quantity. By analyzing the scrap rate, you can identify areas that need improvement, such as processes or materials. For example, a high scrap rate for a particular item category might indicate a problem with the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can optimize resource use to reduce waste and save costs.

# Automate reminders in collections

Make your collections more effective by automating the process of creating, issuing, and sending reminders to your customers. Automation can significantly reduce the time you spend on collections, provide a better overview of the process, and give you full control over each step.

On the **Reminder Automation** page, you define the individual actions (steps). You can combine the steps to create, issue, and send reminders, or you can create a separate automation for each step if that's better for your collection processes. Automations are based on reminder terms and reminder levels. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md). You can set filters for reminder terms for an automation as a whole, and set filters for each action in the automation. You can also attach outstanding invoices to emails as PDF files.

Automation happens through a job queue entry. When you set up an automation, use the **Cadence** field to specify how and when it runs. If you choose **Manual**, the automation runs one time when you use the **Start** action. You can also choose **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or choose **Custom** to set up a more detailed cadence. If you choose **Custom**, you must enter a date formula. To learn more about entering a date formula, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas). When you choose an option other than **Manual**, the automation runs until you pause it to put it on hold. If you want to be even more specific about when it runs, use the **Job queue entries** action to open the **Job Queue Entries** page and adjust the recurrence, for example to daily or a specific weekday.

## Automate the reminders flow

The following sections describe how to set up reminders to create, issue, and send automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminders Automation**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. In the **Reminder Terms Filter** field, choose the reminder term or terms to use this automation for.
1. In the **Cadence** field, choose how often the automation runs.
1. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **New**, and then choose whether the automation creates, issues, or sends reminders. Choose **OK**.
1. Depending on the type of action the automation performs, fill in the fields as necessary on the setup page. To learn more about the settings, go to [Settings for reminder actions](#settings-for-reminder-actions).
1. After you set up the actions for the automation, you can use the **Move up** and **Move down** actions to adjust the order in which they run.

## Settings for reminder actions

The setup settings differ for the Create, Issue, and Send reminder actions. The following sections describe how to use them.

### Create

* Set the highest level on all reminder lines.  
* Create reminders for entries that are on hold. For example, this setting is useful if you're in an ongoing dispute with a customer and want them to see the big picture.
* Create reminders for all unpaid invoices, and not just invoices that are overdue. The report displays overdue invoices and invoices that are unpaid but not overdue in separate sections.
* Set filters to make the reminder more specific.

### Issue

When you issue a reminder, you create entries in the customer ledger that contain the posting date and tax date. Use the settings on the **Issue Reminders Setup** page to specify whether to replace that information on the issued reminder with the information from the created reminder. For example, if you created the reminder yesterday, and issue it today, the due date moves one day.

### Send

> [!NOTE]
> The Send automation requires that you've set up email in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about setting up email, go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

The content of the emails, such as attachment texts, email body texts, and language come from the setup for the reminder term. To learn more about email settings, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

Use the settings on the **Send Reminders Setup** page control the following:

* General settings, such as the description, and how many times you send the same reminder.
* Settings for what to include in the reminder.
* Settings for tracking the reminders you send by creating interactions, whether you print or send the reminder by email, and whether you want to attach overdue invoices only, all invoices, or no invoices. 

## Access the history of a reminder

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] keeps track of each time an automation runs. You can access the history by choosing the **Log entries** action. You can also use the **Issued Reminders** action to access a list of the reminders you've issued.

## Handle errors

On the **Actions** FastTab, for each action you can specify whether you want the automation to stop if the action has an error. If you do, the automation won't process the actions that come afterward. To turn this feature on or off, use the **Set stop on error** or **Clear stop on error** actions.

## Change action settings for an automation

You can change settings for an automation at any time. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **Setup**, and then make your changes.

# Manage intercompany transactions

Businesses with more than one legal entity with separate accounting functions can benefit from intercompany transactions. For example, it's useful for businesses that have subsidiaries in multiple international markets or regions. Or, an organization might have several companies but lack the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. Intercompany transactions simplify and streamline business processes and transactions between companies in the intercompany partnership.

After you specify the customer and vendor relationships for intercompany transactions, partners enter information one time in sales and purchase documents. A corresponding document is created at the other partner involved in the transaction. Mapping the chart of accounts and dimensions helps ensure that information appears in the right places.  

There are four main benefits to the intercompany functionality:  

* Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
* Minimized mistakes with one-time entry of information and system-wide, automated updates  
* Transparent audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
* Efficient transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

## Streamline the flow of business activities  

Intercompany transactions let you distribute sales and purchasing documents and general journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies. Distributing transactions saves time and increases efficiency throughout the organization by reducing data entry. It cuts down on the need to send, receive, print, and archive sales and purchasing documents.  

You're in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and use the **Reverse Journal Postings** and **Undo Receipts/Shipments** actions to make corrections. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company hasn't shipped the goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you don't need to specify the accounts to use. You just choose the intercompany partner. The intercompany functionality creates general journal lines that balance the books of both companies involved in the transaction. In receivables and payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices for transactions between these companies produce corresponding documents in the partner company. The result is correctly balanced accounts.  

Intercompany focuses on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines, and allows transactions between multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases. For example:

* Different countries/regions
* Multiple currencies
* Different charts of accounts
* Different dimensions
* Different item numbers  

Intercompany transactions use several types of entries and documents:  

* General journal entries
* Purchase and sales orders
* Purchase and sales invoices
* Credit memos
* Return orders

When you set up intercompany transactions, you create a list of intercompany partners, an intercompany chart of accounts, and intercompany dimensions. Afterward, you can create transactions in intercompany general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> The general journal by itself doesn't include currencies. It converts all amounts to the local currency at the current exchange rate.

After you set up business partners as customers and vendors, and assign them intercompany partner codes, they can exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges.

> [!NOTE]
> Companies can't use intercompany to exchange all types of data. Purchase invoices are not submitted to business partners through intercompany processes. However, sales invoices that are submitted through intercompany processes will be created as purchase invoices in the receiving company.

# Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

## Use G/L account categories

You create the first layer of a financial report by selecting an account category for each general ledger account. There are six categories:

* Assets
* Liabilities
* Equity
* Income
* Cost of Goods
* Expense

You specify categories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the major sections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports.  

:::image type="content" source="media/account categories financial reporting.png" alt-text="Shows the G/L account categories page.":::

## Use account subcategories

You can also create subcategories for each account. Subcategories help add more details to the mapping for accounts in each category. You also specify subcategories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the subsections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports. Subcategories are more flexible than categories because you can define them. 

:::image type="content" source="media/account subcategories.png" alt-text="Shows account subcategories."::: 

## Map general ledger accounts

The most important feature of the financial reports that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides is the mapping between G/L accounts and account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page. All accounts in the chart of accounts should be listed in a selected category and subcategory, so when you generate financial reports you include all mapped accounts. To learn more about mapping categories, go to the examples in [Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports](bi-examples-custom-financial-reports.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/account mapping.png" alt-text="Shows accounts mapped to G/L account categories.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the mapping only in the United States. If you're using another country version, you must create the mapping yourself. The mapping will become available in more country versions in future releases.

## Generate financial reports

After you set up categories and subcategories have and map all accounts on the chart of accounts, choose **Generate Financial Reports**. This action updates financial reports with the M- prefix with the mapping provided for your chart of accounts.  

To control which reports update when you generate financial reports, update the fields in the **Reporting** section of the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

You can remap and update these reports at any time. If you choose to regenerate them, you can choose to keep the original reports and create copies with the new mapping.

## Audit changes to account categories

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L account categories. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L account categories and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account Category | 570 |

# Sales Order Agent overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Sales Order Agent helps Business Central users automate capturing sales orders. The agent uses AI to analyze customer requests received via email, locate the customer in Business Central, and engage in multi-turn email conversations to clarify requests if important details are missing or more choices are available. It also checks and informs the customer about the availability of the items they're looking for and follows up with a sales quote. The quote is formatted as a PDF and includes the requested items, quantities, units of measure, prices, taxes, requested delivery dates, provided external document reference, and other important details.

> [!TIP]
> Watch a short video in the Dynamics Business Central channel on YouTube at [Get started with the Sales Order Agent for Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6icbmbLc_Og).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->
## Functionality

### Activation and configuration

The agent is readily available in the product. To activate it, you specify the email inbox you want the agent to monitor. Additionally, specify your preferences for certain aspects of the agent's behavior and designate the users authorized to use the agent to process customers' orders, enabling the agent to act on behalf of a company, department, or team&mdash;not just an individual user.

### Permissions and profiles

The agent operates within the permissions and profile (role) assigned to it by the administrator. Permissions define which areas of the product (tables) the agent has access to. The profile outlines the UX elements (pages and actions) the agent can engage with during its work. Default permissions and the profile are assigned to the agent out of the box; however, administrators can update these permissions as needed.

### Operation

Sales Order Agent is designed to run autonomously in the background, using AI to perform its tasks while keeping users informed about key steps and involving them when necessary. Involvement might be needed in specific scenarios, for instance to review outgoing messages or to provide missing details, based on configured preferences.

Conceptually, the agent interacts with Business Central functionality in a manner similar to how Business Central users interact with it. The agent is provided with general instructions, expressed in natural language, outlining how the process of capturing sales orders should be handled. It then uses UI metadata, such as captions, tooltips, and other properties, combined with the data presented on Business Central pages and its own instructions, to determine each step required to complete the task. Starting from the designated Role Center, the agent navigates the pages, invokes UI actions, and enters data as a user would. This approach allows a high degree of flexibility and adaptability for the agent to achieve its goal because the agent’s interaction surface and steps aren’t hardcoded. Instead, AI determines them based on the context of each step.

This flexibility enables the agent to discover and interact with relevant custom fields and actions. It can also attempt to automatically resolve validation errors by processing displayed error messages and adjusting the input accordingly.

### Email monitoring and communications

The agent relies on an internal email dispatcher running as a background task to continuously monitor a designated mailbox for item requests. The dispatcher triggers the agent to perform tasks and subsequently sends results, such as prepared sales quotes or orders, to the customer in response.

The agent helps with composing email bodies based on the context of the current step. For instance, it can list available inventory or provide a brief description of the attached sales quote or sales order. Additionally, it can detect and flag irrelevant or potentially malicious email content, prompting users to review and decide how to proceed.  

### Customer and Business Central user involvement

Users can inspect the agent's steps and the created sales documents. They can easily identify the data entered by the agent compared to data generated by Business Central's own business logic and provide more input if needed, such as adding discounts or updating shipping costs.

If the customer decides to update the quote by sending another email listing required changes, the agent assists with these changes by locating the quote and making the requested updates. Once the customer confirms the quote's accuracy, the agent converts it into a sales order, which is then also shared with the customer via email, following the user's confirmation. 

The agent always involves designated Business Central users to review and approve all outgoing messages before they're sent to the customers.

## How the agent processes requests

The agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. The mailbox is specified in the Sales Order Agent configuration (learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md)). When the agent identifies a potential request in an email, it starts to prepare a sales quote. For example, it verifies whether the customer is registered in Business Central. It then checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer that includes the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, like reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles back-and-forth email exchanges with the customer to resolve missing details and allow modifications to the original request. Learn more in [Agent process flow](#agent-process-flow).

### Identifying customers/contacts and related documents

The agent ensures that a request from one customer can't be about another customer's requests. When the agent processes a request, it first identifies the customer in Business Central using the sender's email address. The agent searches for the email among the registered Business Central contacts, sales quotes and orders, and then looks up the customer linked to that email:

- If a customer is found, the agent filters to use only sales quotes and orders that belong to the customer.

  This behavior ensures that the agent only creates and updates documents belonging to the customer that sent the email

- If a contact is found but it's not a customer, the agent filters to use only documents belonging to the contact. Quotes can be sent to contacts that aren't registered as a customer.
- If no contact is found, the agent filters out all documents, and it might request user intervention because it can't find the document.

To prevent the agent from requesting intervention and to assist with reviewing incoming messages, the agent verifies whether the contact is registered and displays a notification on the incoming message review page if it isn't. To resolve this issue, you can either register a new contact/customer or update the contact information of an existing contact/customer. The agent generates the notification to indicate that the contact email wasn't found.

### Finding products/items

The agent analyzes incoming emails to detect parameters for preparing a new sales quote or updating an existing one. Apart from the items themselves, parameters might include the item attributes, quantities, units of measure, requested delivery date, external document number, and more. The agent then searches for these items in Business Central's inventory, within a wide range of related tables.

|Table|Fields|
|-|-|
|Items|No.<br>Description<br>Description 2<br>Search Description<br>GTIN<br>Vendor Item Number|
|Item Variant|Code<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Reference|Reference No.<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Attributes|Name<br>Value|
|Item Category| Code<br>Description<br>Parent Category - 1 Level|
|Item Translation|Language<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Identifier|Code|
|Extended text Line|Text|

Although the agent can find products based on vague and incomplete descriptions, its effectiveness is influenced by the quality of product information in Business Central. You can improve the agent's ability to find products by enhancing descriptions, attributes, categories, and extended text of your inventory items.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 15 minutes for newly entered data to become searchable as the system re-indexes the tables in the background.

When it finds the items, the agent checks the items' availability by analyzing multiple parameters, such as required quantity, delivery date, location, scheduled and planned receipts, and more.

## Agent process flow

### Participants

Processing a sales quote request into an order involves three participants:

- Customer who requests a sales quote via email.

    Here's an example of an email:

    > Hello,
    >
    > We are in the process of purchasing furniture for our lodge, and after reviewing your website I would like to request a quote for the following items:
    >
    > - 2 Antwerp tables
    > - 4 Berlin chairs
    > - 4 Rome chairs
    >
    > Could you please provide a sales quote? We will need the items delivered by March 2nd. Additionally, please note our purchase order number: DC1011234.
    >
    > Thank you,
    >
    > [Name]

- Sales order agent, which monitors the mailbox, handles the incoming request, and creates the quote and order.
- Business Central user who reviews agent tasks.

### General flow

The general flow is illustrated in the figure, which is followed by more details of the steps. The actual flow might vary depending on factors such as follow-up requests, changes or cancellations in review, blocking issues, and so on.

# Managing contacts

Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that might develop into formal relationships. All such external contacts and their detailed information should be recorded in the system so that communication is more successful and so they can easily be converted to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

Use the **Contacts** list to manage your contacts. From there, you can create opportunities and manage other interactions with individual contacts. You can also see statistics about a contact, and you can access a range of reports. For information about how to find the right contact in the list, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md) .  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Reserve items

You can reserve items for sales orders, purchase orders, service orders, assembly orders, transfer orders, and production orders. You can also reserve items in inventory or inbound on open document or journal lines.

Each line you open to reserve items displays information about one type of line (sales, purchase, or journal) or inventory entry. The lines describe how many items are available to be reserved from each type of line or entry.

> [!TIP]
> Based on the quantities you reserve in inventory, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a status on the documents so that you’re quickly aware of the next step. For example, to indicate that you can ship a sales order or start to work on a project, assembly, or production order. The status also helps reduce the risk of accidental partial shipments or hold-ups due to missing stock for production and assembly orders.
>
> The **Reserved from stock** field can help you understand whether you can ship or pick for a specific order or order line. For lines, the Reserved from stock field is available on FactBoxes. To access the information for the entire order, the field is on the **Statistics** page.

## Reserve items for sales

The following procedure describes how to reserve items from a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase, service, transfer, and assembly orders.
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the sales order.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action. The **Reservation** page opens.  
4. Select the line you want to reserve the items from.  
5. Choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Description**|
    |------------------|---------------------|  
    |**Auto Reserve**|Automatically reserve items on the **Reservation** page.|  
    |**Reserve from Current Line**|Reserve the items on the selected line.|  
    |**Cancel Reservation from Current Line**|Cancel reservation of the items on the selected line.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are item tracking lines for the sales order, the reservation system takes you through a few special steps. Learn more at [To reserve a specific serial or lot number](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md#reserve-a-specific-serial-or-lot-number).  

## Reserve an item for a production order line

You can reserve items for production orders. You must distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve parent items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Functions** group, choose the **Reserve** action.
5. On the **Reservation** page, select the Sales Line, Order Line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.

## Reserve items for production order components

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve component items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, then choose **Components**.  
5. Select the relevant component line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select a line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production component line is now reserved.

## Reserve items in bulk

Use the **Reservation Worksheet** page to reserve and allocate incoming goods in bulk. For example, bulk reservations can help ensure that quantities are available for your sales and production orders. You can have multiple batches for different purposes. For example, you might allocate production orders on a weekly basis but reserve daily for sales.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reservation Worksheet**, then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Get Demand** action. The **Get Demand to Reserve** page opens.
1. On the **Get Demand to Reserve** page, specify the kind of demand you want to reserve from available inventory.
1. Fill in the filters as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Optional: To allocate the items right away, choose the **Allocate** action.
1. On the **Allocation Policy** page, choose a policy for each step.

   |Allocation policy  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Basic (No Conflicts)     | Allocates stock to a demand if there are no conflicts and the demand can be fully covered. For example, you have sales order A with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If you have 20 in stock, both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, no stock is allocated. You must manually allocate the quantity.        |
   |Equally    | Distributes available stock to demand equally. For example, you have a sales order with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If your stock level is 20, then both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, both demands get 6.        |
   |By Customer Priority|Distribution based on the **Priority** field on the **Customer Card** page. In cases of low inventory quantities, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supplies higher-priority customers first.|

1. To reserve all lines where **Accept** is turned on, choose the **Make reservation** action.

## Change a reservation

You can change an item reservation.

1. On the document line you made the reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action.
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, update the **Quantity** field on the line you want to change.
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **OK** button.

## Cancel a reservation

You can cancel an item reservation.

1. From the document line you want to cancel a reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action on the **Lines** FastTab.  
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, choose the **Cancel Reservation** action.  
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **Yes** button.  

## Reserve a specific serial or lot number

From outbound documents for item-tracked items, such as sales orders or production component lists, you can reserve specific serial or lot numbers. For example, reserving specific serial or lot numbers can be useful in the following situations:

* You need production components from a specific lot to ensure consistency with earlier production batches.
* Because a customer requested a specific serial number.

Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

This practice is referred to as a specific reservation, because you reserve from the quantity of item X that belongs to lot X. In contrast, if you reserve only from quantities of item X, then it's simply a normal, nonspecific, reservation. Learn more at [Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Create a sales order line for an item-tracked item.  
3. Assign serial and lot numbers to the sales order line. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).
4. On the sales order line, choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. Choose the **Yes** button to reserve specific serial or lot numbers.  
6. On the **Item Tracking List** page, select the serial and lot number combination you assigned.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to open the **Reservation** page showing only supply with the specified item tracking number. If the line has nonspecific reservations on any of the item tracking numbers, you're informed of the quantity that is already reserved.  
8. Choose either the **Auto Reserve** or the **Reserve from Current Line** action to create the reservation of the specific item tracking numbers.

# Define user tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

Some usage scenarios for User Tasks are 

| If you work with... | Set up user tasks to track or follow-up on... |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Finance             | Month-end checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Adjust cost<br>* Set a posting date range<br>* Close an inventory period<br>* Reconcile accounts payable (AP)<br>* Reconcile accounts receivable (AR)<br>* Recurring journals<br>* Bank reconciliation |
| Finance             | Year-close checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Financial reporting (prepare and finalize annual financial statements)<br>* Audit preparation (gather necessary documents and information for external auditors)<br>* Budget review (compare actual performance against budget and analyze variances)<br>* Budget planning (develop the budget for the next fiscal year)<br>* Accounts receivable (follow up on outstanding invoices for the fiscal year and write off bad debts if necessary)<br>* Accounts payable (ensure all bills and expenses for the fiscal year are recorded and paid)<br>* Check whether fixed assets depreciations for the fiscal year are posted |
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on lead generation (identifying and contacting potential customers)<br>* Track communications with potential customers<br>* Sales calls/meetings (scheduling and conducting meetings with prospects)<br>* Proposal and quote creation (preparing and sending pricing and service details to prospects)<br>* Sales closing (finalizing deals and signing contracts)<br>* Customer relationship management (maintaining relationships with existing customers for up-selling or cross-selling opportunities)
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on sales target tracking (monitoring progress towards sales goals)<br>* Follow-up on sales activities such as recurring updates on sales targets |
| Sales               |* Weekly/Monthly follow-ups on revenue forecasting (predicting future sales based on current data)<br>* Competitor analysis (keeping an eye on competitor products, prices, and marketing strategies)<br>* Sales reporting (preparing sales reports for management review) |
| Sales               | * Monthly/Quarterly follow-ups on market research (understanding industry trends and customer needs)<br>* Training and development (improving sales skills and product knowledge) |

The list of sample user tasks for sales in the table was generated by AI using Microsoft Copilot. If you want to generate similar lists for your work domain, consider copying and modifying the following prompt:

```Copilot prompt
Come up with a list of common tasks for people working in a sales team that would be useful to track in a system. 

Format the list in bullet form
```

## Managing user task groups

You can use **User Task Groups** to group related tasks and assign them to a group of users instead of individual users. For example, you could create a group for "Month-end" activities and then assign membership to users in the accounting department. This way, anyone in the team can pick up tasks.

## Managing user tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.  

:::image type="content" source="media/across-user-tasks/sample-user-task.png" alt-text="Example of a user task.":::

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you can't link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible. For example, write "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking up user tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

After you complete a task, mark it as completed.  

### Deleting user tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks to delete.

# Suggest lines on sales documents with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to create sales documents faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add to lines on sales documents for your customers.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Sales line suggestions

Sales line suggestion can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

- Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

- Find documents by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator activates the **Sales Line Suggestions** capability on the **Copilot & agents capabilities** page. Learn more at [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Examples of prompts

Suggest sales lines with Copilot can handle a wide variety of prompt input. This section offers examples of prompts for various scenarios we tested.

### Sample inquiry to repeat a document

Prompt: *Need all the products from invoice 103031*

### During a phone call, you quickly type a list of required products and quantities, but aren't always exact and sometimes use internal product names

Prompt: *2 Red Kids Biicycle*

The prompt works, even with multiple typos.

### A user copies an inquiry from an inbound communication and pastes it onto the Sales Lines Suggestions page

Prompt: *Hello, I'm interested in buying some accessories for my XXXX Laptop, such as a wireless mouse, a keyboard cover, and a laptop bag. I wonder if you have any recommendations or suggestions for these items. Do you have any special offers or discounts for loyal customers like me? Kind regards, M*

Note that XXXX Laptop isn't included in search.

## Options for matching keywords in prompts

When you search for an item using a FullText index, we extract both primary and extra keywords. For example, we break down the search term "Red Coffee Table" into primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table," and some synonyms and other keywords, such as "Red."

When you enter your prompt in the **Suggest Sales Lines** window, the **Matching** field offers the following options for matching criteria:

- [Permissive](#permissive-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are optional. This option typically generates the most suggestions.
- [Balanced](#balanced-matching-criteria) is a blend of required and optional keywords. This option typically generates fewer suggestions.
- [Precise](#precise-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are required. This option typically generates the fewest suggestions.

The following sections provide examples of how matching works. The examples are based on a prompt for "Red Coffee Table" and you have the following fictitious items:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Permissive matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are optional. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Balanced matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table

### Precise matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is required. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table

## Suggest lines on a sales document

This process describes how to suggest lines on a sales order. The steps are the same for sales quotes and invoices.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open a sales order or create a new one.
1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Suggest sales lines**.
1. In the **Suggested sales lines** window, enter your prompt or select one from the prompt guides.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add to lines, review its suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose the Discard button (trash can) next to the **Keep it** button.
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Keep it**. 

There's a **Reliability** field that displays **High (80+)**, **Medium (60-80)**, and **Low (60-)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to a sales document. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well, or delete the whole document.

# Get the Business Central add-in for Outlook

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in [!INCLUDE [outlook-name](includes/outlook-name.md)]. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] add-in, you can view financial data related to customers and vendors. You can also create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

There are two ways to get the Business Central add-in for Outlook installed, depending on your role in the organization:

- As a Microsoft 365 administrator, use *Centralized Deployment* to install the add-in automatically for the entire organization, groups, or specific users.

- As any user, install the add-in for your own use if not already done by your admin.

## About the Business Central add-in for Outlook

The Business Central add-in for Outlook consists of two smaller add-ins:

- Contact insights

    This add-in provides users with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also enables you to create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such sales quotes and invoices to a contact. <!--To support these task, the add-in adds actions to the Outlook ribbon, in the **Business Central** group. --> 

- Document view

    When an email refers to a business document number in the email body, this add-in provides a direct, in-line link from email body to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For more information about what you do with the add-ins, see [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

Each add-in is provided as an XML file, called a *manifest*, which must be installed in Outlook of anyone who wants this functionality. These files describe how to activate the add-ins and connect to Business Central when they're used in Outlook. Working with these files is typically done by an admin. As a user, in most cases, you won't have to handle with these files directly. Either your admin will set up the add-in to install automatically for you or you'll use the built-in assisted setup to handle the installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Working with multiple environments? The Business Central add-in for Outlook is designed to work with a single Business Central environment. When the add-in is installed, the name of the environment is included in the add-in's manifest. This configuration means that the add-in will only connect to the environment that it was installed from. To use the add-in with a different environment, you'll open the environment and install the add-in again.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment as an admin

Centralized Deployment is a feature in Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Outlook. It's the recommended way for admins to deploy for Office add-ins to users and groups within your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For Business Central on-premises, see [Setting Up the Add-In for Outlook Integration with Business Central On-Premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/setting-up-office-add-ins-outlook-inbox) in the administration content (English only).

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 subscription  
- Users are assigned a Microsoft 365 license  
- Your Microsoft 365 account has at least the [Exchange Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#exchange-administrator) role

### Deploy the add-in

1. In Business Central, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **Outlook Add-in Centralized Deployment** to start the assisted setup guide.
1. Review the first page and select **Next** to open the page for downloading the add-ins.
1. In the **Deploy** column, select the check box for the add-ins that you want to deploy, then select **Download and Continue**.

    A file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device.

1. At this point, you're finished with the work you need to do in Business Central, so you can select **Done**.

   >[!TIP]
   > Before you select **Next**, select the **Go to Microsoft 365 (opens in a new window)** link to open and sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a new browser window. You'll have to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a later step anyways.

1. Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** files from the .zip to a folder of your choice.

    For more information, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, then go to [Integrated Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967).

1. Select **Upload custom apps**.
1. On the **Upload Apps to deploy** page, set **App type** to **Office Add-in**.
1. Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device** > **Choose file**.
1. Choose one of the add-in files **Context Insights.xml** or **Documents.xml** that you extracted earlier.
1. Follow the instructions to assign users and deploy the add-in.
1. Repeat step 9 through 11 for the other add-in file if you want.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A green check mark appears when the add-in is deployed to the admin center. However, it can take up to 24 hours before users see the add-in in the [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] app. Users might have to restart Outlook as well.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-do-you-target-add-in-user-assignments-with-centralized-deployment-&preserve-view=true).

## <a name="install"></a>Install the add-in for your own use

If your organization allows it, you can install the Business Central add-in for just yourself. Contact your administrator if you're not sure.

1. In Business Central, go to the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Get the Outlook Add-in**, and then select the related link.
2. Read the page and select **Next** when ready.
3. If you want to receive a welcome email message from Business Central with overview of using the add-in, turn on **Send sample email message**.

Business Central now connects to your email server and installs the add-in in your [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)]. This operation doesn't take long. You're now ready to start using the add-in in [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)].

### <a name="onprem"></a>For Business Central on-premises

If you're using Business Central on-premises, installing the add-in might be slightly different.

1. In Business Central, go to the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Get the Outlook Add-in**, then select the related link.
1. Read the page and select **Next** when ready.
1. Do one of the following steps, depending on the page you see:

    - If you see the **Install to my Outlook** button, select it and you're all done.
    - If you see the **Next** button, select it. On the next page, if you want to receive a welcome email message from Business Central with overview of using the add-in, turn on **Send sample email message**. Then, select **Finish** and you're all done.
    - If you see the **Download Add-in** button, select it, then continue to the next step.
1. When you select **Download Add-in**, a file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device. You should find the file at the top of the browser.

   Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** file from the .zip to a folder of your choice. For more information about how to extract files, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).

# Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use Sales Order Agent to automate taking sales orders based on customer inquiries about products/items received via email.

Sales Order Agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. When it identifies a potential request, it starts converting the request into an order. For example, it verifies the customer, checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer with the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, such as reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles email exchanges with the customer to resolve any missing details and allow for modifications to the original request if necessary.

Learn more about Sales Order Agent and its process flow in [How the agent processes requests](sales-order-agent.md#how-the-agent-processes-requests).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

Sales Order Agent is activated, and you have permission to use it. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

## Get started

You collaborate with Sales Order Agent to review and convert quotes into orders using the **Tasks** tab in the **Copilot** pane.

To access this view, select ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon.](media/soa-activated-number-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** on the upper right of the navigation menu. A red circle with a number on the icon indicates the tasks that need attention.

![Shows the task view with steps](media/soa-task-view-callouts.png "Shows the task view with steps")

The ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** tab opens in the **Copilot** pane to display tasks recently created by Sales Order Agent. Tasks that require attention&mdash;like reviewing an incoming or outgoing email&mdash;are at the top of the list.  

For each sales quote request, Sales Order Agent adds a task to track, review, and follow up on updates, eventually processing the quote into an order. Tasks can consist of multiple steps that form a timeline of the process.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon with an open action.](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon in the role or select the ![Show summary for Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-summary-icon.png) **Show summary for Sales Order Agent** in the **Task** tab to get an overview of the agent's key performance indicators (KPIs) summarizing the impact of the agent's work in your organization. For example, view the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent, the time saved by your team, and the total number of sales orders created.

## Review and assist

While the agent does the bulk of work autonomously, it asks for user intervention when required for various steps to move through the process, such as:

- Reviewing and confirming incoming email requests from customers.
- Reviewing and confirming the sales quotes and orders if an admin configured Sales Order Agent to do so.
- Reviewing outgoing emails created by Sales Order Agent for the customer.
- Providing assistance to Sales Order Agent when it needs to get unblocked—for example, to provide missing data.

Steps requiring intervention are listed under **Needs Attention** in the **Tasks** tab. To review a step:

1. In the **Task** tab, select the step requesting review or assistance.

   The task *timeline* opens, focused on the selected step. The timeline displays each step of a task, past and present, in chronological order.

1. Select **Review** for the step.

   The **Tasks** tab switches to **Review** mode, and the Agent Task Message window opens to display the email contents or quote or order, depending on the task.

1. Review the email contents or the quote or order and make changes as needed. You can't edit incoming emails from the customer.

1. When you're satisfied with the content and want the process to continue, select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. If you want to complete the task yourself, select **Stop** to halt the agent's processing of this task.

After confirmation, Sales Order Agent continues processing the task. When a new notification appears on the Sales Order Agent icon after some time, follow the same flow to verify and approve the results.

## Modify sales quotes and orders

You might need to modify sales quotes or orders created by the agent during a review step or when the agent requests assistance, based on its configuration. When you select **Review**, the quote or order opens for inspection. Make changes as needed, then select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. The agent processes the document, creating a PDF for the outgoing email to the customer.

You also have the opportunity to modify a quote or order during the review step for an outgoing email. In this case, select **...** (More options) > **Discard step** on the step. This action stops the task temporarily to allow you to open the quote or order and makes changes and then resume the step.

![Shows the discard step action on a Sales Order Agent task.](media/soa-discard-step.png "Shows the discard step action on a Sales Order Agent task.")

> [!NOTE]
> **Discard step** is available only on review steps for outgoing emails.

After you make the changes, return to the **Tasks** tab, select one of the following options for resuming the task, and then select **Send**:

- **I have updated the quote** or **I have updated the order**: Select one of these options if you made changes to the quote or order. The agent generates a new PDF and email for the customer.
- **Just resume**: Select this option if you didn't change the quote or order. The agent doesn't generate a new quote or order and keeps the original email as before.  

![Shows the resume step action on a Sales Order Agent task.](media/soa-resume-step.png "Shows the resume step action on a Sales Order Agent task.")

If you change your mind while reviewing the outgoing message and decide to make more changes to the sales document, use the **Discard step** action to discard the email message generated by the agent. Then, update the sales document as needed and instruct the agent to create a new outgoing email with the updated attachment.

## Assist with item availability

Depending on the agent's setup, it can check item availability in the requested quantity before adding them to a quote or order. You can't change the items and quantities at this point, but you can review and confirm the step so the agent creates a reply email to the customer.

<!--
1. Select **Review** to open the **Items availability** page.
1. Use the page to verify that the item isn't available in the requested quantity.
1. Select **Confirm**.

   The agent creates the reply email for review.-->

Learn more in [Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-item-availability.md).

## Stop a task

Most steps of a task include a **Stop** button that lets you terminate the process. When you select **Stop**, a task isn't terminated immediately—you're asked to confirm before the task is stopped.

Before you stop a task, consider the following behavior:

- Stopped tasks can't be restarted.
- Stopping the task might leave some results incomplete or unwanted, and it might require follow-up actions with the customers. Follow up actions depend on where in the process the task was stopped.

  For example, suppose you stopped a task after a sales quote was created. Although the process stopped, the sales quote is still stored in the system as open. You might have to manually edit the state depending on your company policy and then update the customer.
- Stopped tasks aren't deleted immediately. You can still explore a task's timeline until it's deleted, typically by an administrator.

<!--

## View timeline and details of steps

From the ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** view, you can view the details of each step of a task in chronological order. Click on the task or select **...** (More options) > **Show Details**.-->

## Scenarios impacting reliability in handling customer requests

- You might need to correct the quantities in the created document when non-base units of measurement differ from the standard ones.  

  For example, if the system treats 1 kilogram as 900 grams and a customer requests 2 kilograms, the system might generate a document showing 2,000 grams instead of 1,800 grams or 2 kilograms.

- Reliability decreases if you significantly change the email the agent drafts about item availability before sending it to the customer.

  This issue is more apparent when the external customer follows up with an email using pronouns like "them" or "it" and other words instead of repeating specific quantities and names. For example, the customer replies, "I want them all."

- The agent searches for items using item attributes, but the attributes aren't shown to the agent on the item availability page. This condition decreases reliability for customer requests that depend specifically on the attributes.

  Consider the following example:

  1. Items in the database:
  
     `[{no: ITEM-1, description: Shirt, attributes: Linen}, {no: ITEM-2, description: Shirt, attributes: Cotton}]`

  2. Customer's initial request email:

     `I want a quote for nice shirts`

  3. Agent's reply email:
  
     `We have X quantity of ITEM-1 Shirt and ITEM-2 Shirt`

  4. Customer's response email:
  
     `I want the ones with linen material`

# Design Details: Item Tracking Availability
The **Item Tracking Lines** and **Item Tracking Summary** pages provide dynamic availability information for serial or lot numbers. The purpose of this is to increase transparency for users on outbound documents, such as sales orders, by showing them which serial numbers or how many units of a lot number are currently assigned on other open documents. This reduces uncertainty that is caused by double allocation and instills confidence in order processors that the item tracking numbers and dates that they are promising on unposted sales orders can be fulfilled. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page](design-details-item-tracking-lines-window.md).  

 When you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page, availability data is retrieved from the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. When you choose the **Serial No.** field or the **Lot No.** field, the **Item Tracking Summary** page opens and shows a summary of the item tracking information in the **Reservation Entry** table. The summary contains the following information about each serial or lot number on the item tracking line:  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently in inventory.|  
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently requested in all documents.|  
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The quantity that is entered in the current instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page but is not yet committed to the database.|  
|**Total Available Quantity**|The quantity of the serial or lot number that is available for the user to request.<br /><br /> This quantity is calculated from other fields on the page as follows:<br /><br /> total quantity – (total requested quantity + current pending quantity).|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also see the information in the preceding table by using the **Select Entries** function on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 To preserve database performance, availability data is only retrieved once from the database when you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page and when you use the **Refresh Availability** function on the page.  

## Calculation Formula  
 As described in the preceding table, the availability of a given serial or lot number is calculated as follows.  

 total available quantity = quantity in inventory – (all demands + quantity not yet committed to the database)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This formula implies that the serial or lot number availability calculation considers only inventory and ignores projected receipts. Accordingly, supply that is not yet posted to inventory does not affect item tracking availability, as opposed to regular item availability where projected receipts are included.

# Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer, you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract.  
  
By handling a service item under multiple contracts, you can do the following:  
  
* Issue different contracts for the same service item.  
* Service parts separately.  
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item, such as mechanical components and software.  
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item.  
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods.  
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order.  
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements.  
  
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality.  
  
## Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item  
You can manually create a service contract or contract quote for service items already registered in non-canceled contracts owned by the same customer. To do this, follow the standard procedure of creating service contracts and service contract quotes. For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md).  
  
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes, a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes. If you confirm this message, all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line.  
  
## Copying Documents  
You can automatically create a service contract or contract quote for service items that are already registered in other service contracts or contract quotes by using the **Copy from Document** action.  
  
## Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts  
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts. A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired.

# Allocate Resources
The key element to service management is the people who supply service. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the appropriate people to the appropriate projects. Assignments can be based on service zones where the people are located or where the service occurs. In addition, you can group resources together when responding to service requests. For more information, see [Set Up Resource Allocation](service-how-setup-resource-allocation.md).

You can allocate resources, for example, technicians, by using the **Dispatch Board**, or from a service order. You can use resource availability to allocate resources to perform the service tasks in the orders or quotes.

You can allocate the same resource, for example, a technician, or resource group to all the service items in a service order. Allocation entries are created for the other service items in the order with the same resource number and allocation date as the line you allocated. The allocated hours are the hours you allocated divided by the number of service items in the order. The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active** for all the entries that were created.

## To see an overview of service orders and service quotes  
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one. For example,you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Document Filter** field, choose the type of the documents you want to see.
3. To get a list of documents that contain service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** and **Resource Group Filter** fields and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. To get a list of documents with a certain response date or response dates within a certain date period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. To get a list of documents with a specified allocation state or document status, fill in the **Allocation Filter/Status Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
6. To get a list of documents that belong to a certain contract, customer, or zone, fill in the **Contract Filter/Customer Filter/Zone Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
7. Choose a line that corresponds to a service order or service quote, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    The **Service Order** or **Service Quote** page opens, and you can work with the document. To return to the **Dispatch Board** page, choose **OK**.

## To allocate a resource using resource or resource group availability    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource.  
4. Choose either the **Resource Availability** or **Res. Group Availability** action.  
5. On the **Res. Availability (Service)** page, choose **Show Matrix**.  
6. Choose a resource to allocate. You can base your selection on whether the resource is skilled for the task, whether it is located in the customer zone, and/or whether it is preferred by the customer.  
7. Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task, and which is close to the response date of the service order.  
8. In the **Qty. to Allocate** field, enter the number of hours you want to allocate the resource to the service task for.  
9. Choose the **Allocate** action to allocate the selected resource on the selected date.  

     The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active**.  

 Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be **Active** allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.  

## To allocate a resource using a service order  
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote, you can allocate resources, for example, technicians, to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to.  
4. Choose **Resource Allocations**.
5. On the **Resource Allocations** page, choose a nonactive allocation entry with the service task you want to allocate the resource to. If the allocation entry does not exist, you can create a new one by choosing **New**.  
7. Specify the service task by filling in the **Service Item No.** field on the same line.  
8. In the **Resource No.** field, choose the resource. If the resource is a member of a resource group, the number of the resource group is entered automatically into the **Resource Group No.** field.  
9. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The **Status** field is set to **Active**. This means that the resource is allocated to the service task.  
10. Optionally, to assign the resource to all items, choose **Allocate to All Service Items**.

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.

## To reallocate resources on a service order  
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it. The original entry will still exist, but its status is updated as follows:  

* If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
* If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. Select the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
4. On the **Resource Allocations** page, select an allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate the resource to. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. This overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
5. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
6. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.

## To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board  
If the resource allocated to a service task cannot accomplish the work, it means that this service task needs reallocation. Usually you reallocate resources to a service task by using the **Dispatch Board**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Allocation Filter** field, select **Reallocation Needed**. The **Dispatch Board** page now shows the list of service orders that include service tasks that need reallocation.  
3. Select the relevant service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action. The **Resource Allocations** page opens.  
4. Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to.  
5. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. It overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The **Reallocation Entry Reasons** dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
7.  Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The old entry still exists but the status is updated in the following ways:  
    >   
    >  * If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
    > * If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
    > * If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

## To register resource hours  
When working on service items in service orders, you need to register the resource hours used for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the resource hours on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

You can use the same procedure to register the hours on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the Service Order page. Open the relevant service card, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  

If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign a resource to all service items in an order
If the same resource, for example a technician, works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to divide the resource hours onto the resource lines for the other service items.  

The following procedure shows how to split resource lines on the **Service Invoice Lines** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Service Lines** action. The **Service Lines** page opens.  
4. Select the resource line you want to split. The contents of the **Quantity** field is divided between all the service items in the order.  
5. Choose the **Split Resource Line** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

    Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split. The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order.  

## To cancel an allocation  
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for.  
4. Choose the **Cancel Allocation** action.  
5. In the **Reason Code** field, select the appropriate reason code.  
6. Choose **Yes** to confirm the cancellation.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the **Status** field, the **Reallocation Needed** option is automatically selected. If the repair status of the service item in the entry is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred**, that is, no service has been started. If the repair status is **In Process**, it is changed to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some service has been completed.

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and nontransactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Subidiaries use a pull model to pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you can't complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that is the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you don't yet have coupled records. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you want to pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization is stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain nontransactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. Keeping the record in the subsidiary helps prevent unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

# Create recurring purchase lines

If you often need to create purchase lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.

## Set up recurring purchase lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter the information in the fields that reflect the standard lines you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring purchase lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual purchase documents after you insert the recurring purchase lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring purchase lines to a vendor

Assign one or more recurring purchase lines to a vendor so that they're available to insert on purchase documents from that vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant vendor.
3. Choose the **Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, select codes for the recurring purchase lines that you want to be able to insert on purchase documents for the vendor.
5. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring purchase lines are to be used.
6. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on each document type, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring purchase line that exists for the vendor.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring purchase line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Purchase Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a vendor card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring purchase lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring purchase lines on a purchase invoice

If recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you can insert them, or have them automatically added, on all types of purchase documents, such as a purchase invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring purchase lines to vendors, you'll be informed if recurring purchase lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to insert one or more standard purchase lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard purchase lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard purchase lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

# Purchase items for a sale by creating purchase invoices

From sales orders and sales invoices, you can use functions to quickly create purchase documents for missing item quantities that are required by the sale. You can use two different functions depending on the document type.

> [!Note]
> This functionality is for replenishing sales items into your own inventory. To purchase items for direct delivery from your vendor to your customer, you must create a drop shipment. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).   

|Function|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Create Purchase Orders**|From a sales order, this function creates a purchase order for each vendor of items on the sales order. You can edit the purchase quantity before you create the purchase orders. Only unavailable sales quantities are suggested.
|**Create Purchase Invoice**|From a sales order and from a sales invoice, this function creates a purchase invoice for a selected vendor for all lines or selected lines on the sales document. The full sales quantity is suggested.|

## To create one or more purchase orders from a sales order
To create a purchase order for each unavailable item quantity on the sales order, you use the **Create Purchase Orders** function.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales order that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.

    The **Create Purchase Orders** page opens showing a line for each different item on the sales order. Lines for both fully available sales quantities and unavailable sales quantities (grayed) are shown by default. You can choose the **Show Unavailable** action to only see lines for unavailable sales quantities.

    The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable sales quantity by default.
4. To purchase another quantity than the unavailable sales quantity, edit the value in the **Quantity to Purchase** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on grayed lines even though they represent fully available sales quantities.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase order is created for each vendor of items on the sales order, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page.
7. Proceed to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).


## To create a purchase invoice from a sales order or sales invoice
To create a single purchase invoice for one or more lines on a sales document by first selecting which vendor to buy from, you use the **Create Purchase Invoice** function.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This function creates a purchase invoice for the exact item quantity on the selected sales document. To change the purchase quantity, you must edit the purchase invoice after it is created.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that you want to purchase items for.
3. Select one or more sales invoice lines that you want to use on the purchase invoice. To use all the sales invoice lines, select either all of them or don't select any lines.
4. Choose the **Create Purchase Invoice** action.
5. Select either **All Lines** or **Selected Lines**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6. In the list of vendors that appears, select the vendor that you want to buy all the items from, and then choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase invoice is created that contains one, more than one, or all the lines on the sales invoice.
7. Proceed to process the purchase invoice, for example, by editing or adding purchase invoice lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Reconcile payments using automatic application

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page specifies payments, either incoming or outgoing, that have been recorded as transactions on your online bank account or on a payment service. You can apply the payments to related open customer, vendor, and bank account ledger entries. Fill in the journal by importing a bank statement as a bank feed or file or by manually entering transactions that you make through your payment service.

> [!NOTE]
> The page offers automatic matching functionality that applies payments to their related open entries based on a matching of data on a bank statement line (journal line) with data on one or more open entries. Note that you can overwrite the suggested automatic applications, and you can choose to not use automatic application at all. For more information, see step 7.

A payment reconciliation journal is related to one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The bank account represents the online bank account where the payment transactions are recorded. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. The bank account will be automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

If you use the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page to register and apply customer payments, you can set up the journal to use a specific number series. Afterward, you can specify the number series in the **Payment Reconciliation No. Series** field on a bank account. Using a dedicated number series can make it easier to identify any entries that were posted through the journal.

Similar to other journals, when you correct posted entries you can reverse entries that were posted through the payment reconciliation journal from the **G/L Register** page. For example, you might want to reverse entries for payments you applied to the wrong customer. You must first un-apply the posted customer ledger entries. Then you can use the **Reverse Register** action in the **G/L Register** page to reverse the journal that posted the payments. Alternatively, on the **Posted General Journals** page, you can use the **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** action to reverse specific lines from the posted payment reconciliaiton journal. 

When you use automatic application, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recognizes bank ledger entries that have already been posted, which helps prevent double-posting.

You can import bank transactions as .csv bank files or other format that your bank provides. If you want to import bank statements as bank feeds, you must first enable a dedicated bank integration service, and then link the bank account to its related online bank account. The payment reconciliation journal will then automatically detect bank feeds when you choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action. In addition, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statement feeds every hour. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled won't be imported. You can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service for to get those transactions, which is preinstalled in some country versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md). Alternatively, a Microsoft partner can help you meet your business or country requirements.

The **Map Text to Account** action lets you set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal. Mapping is useful, for example, for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. (See step 10) For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

Journal lines might have no suggested application, which can happen for various reason. For example, because a document is missing, or a customer overpaid and there's an excess amount after applying the payment on another journal line. For such cases, you can use the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry, for example for a refund, that is needed to apply the payment to. (See step 11) For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

You use the **Apply Automatically** function either automatically when you import a bank file or feed with payment transactions or when you activate it, to apply payments to their related open entries based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (journal line) with text on one or more open entries. This automation is based on rules that you define on the **Payment Application Rules** page, where you also define whether an application suggestion requires review. For more information, see [Set up rules for automatic application of payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

On journal lines where a payment has been applied automatically to one or more open entries, the **Match Confidence** field has a value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** to indicate the quality of the data matching that the suggested payment application is based on.

Some payment applications require your review as defined by the used matching rule, such as lines with **Low** match confidence. Other lines require your review and manual change because there's a value in the **Difference** field. To review one or more payment applications, choose the **Lines to Review** or **Lines with Difference** field at the bottom. The **Payment Application Review** page opens showing all relevant information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** action. (See steps 7 and 8)

For each journal line on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. (See step 10) For more information, see [Review, or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can start the bank transactions import at the same time as you open the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page for an existing journal. The following procedure describes how to import bank transactions into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page after you have created a new journal.

## To reconcile payments using automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To work in a new payment reconciliation journal, choose the **New Journal** action.
3. On the **Payment Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to reconcile payments for, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page opens prepared for the selected bank account.
4. Choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action.
   If the bank account for the selected journal isn't set up for importing bank transactions, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will help you do that.
5. On the **Select a file to import** page, select the file that contains the bank transactions for payments that you want to reconcile, and then choose the **Open** button.  
6. If the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is enabled, on the **Bank Statement Filter** page that opens automatically, specify the date interval for the bank statements to be imported.

    The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page is filled with lines for payments representing bank transactions in the imported bank statement.

     On lines for payments that have been automatically applied to related open entries, the **Match Confidence** field indicates the quality of the data matching on which the suggested payment application is based. Also, the **Account Name**, **Account Type**, and **Account No.** fields show information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to.

    The automatic applications, the matching qualities, and whether lines require review are controlled by rules. You can edit the rules to adjust the results. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

7. To review, accept/remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that have a value in the **Difference** field, choose the **Lines with Difference** action at the bottom.

    The **Payment Application Review** page opens and shows the first application to review. The next application to review will be shown on the page as you process the preceding one. The review includes information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** and **Apply Manually** actions.

8. To review, accept or remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that the rule has set to be reviewed, choose the **Lines to Review** action. 

9. To change an automatic application, select a journal line, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action to reapply or apply the payment manually on the **Payment Application** page. For more information, see [Review or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

10. Select an unapplied journal line for a recurring cash receipt or expense, such as a car gasoline purchase, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

    When you've finished your mapping of payment text to accounts, choose the **Apply Manually** action.

    When text-to-account mapping is set up, the resulting automatic payment application will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping** in the **Match Confidence** field.

11. For a journal line has no suggested application because no ledger entry exists that it can be applied to, choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry that is needed to apply the payment to. For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied.](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)

12. When no more lines require review and the **Difference** field is blank on all lines, choose the **Post** action, and then choose one of the following options:

    - **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Accounts** - To post the payments as applied and also close the related bank account ledger entries as reconciled.
    - **Post Payments Only** - To only post the payments as applied, but leave the related bank account ledger entries open. Required that you reconcile the bank account separately,  for example: For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).
    - **Test Report** - To review the result of posting before you post. The **Bank Account Statement** report opens and shows the same fields as at the bottom of the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

When you post the payment reconciliation journal, the applied open entries are closed. The customer, vendor, or general ledger accounts are updated. For payments on journal lines based on text-to-account mapping, the specified customer, vendor, and general ledger accounts are updated. For all journal lines, bank account ledger entries are created. If you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action, any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

You can compare the value in the **Balance on Bank Account After Posting** field together with the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** field to track when the bank account is reconciled based on payments that you post.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you do not want to reconcile the bank account from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, then you must use the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

# Register new vendors

Vendors provide the products you sell. Each vendor you purchase from must be registered with a vendor card.

Before you register new vendors, you must set up various purchase codes to select from when you fill in vendor cards. After all the required master data is created, you can add unique characteristics for a vendor, such as prioritize the vendor for payment purposes or list items that the vendor and other vendors supply. Another group of setup tasks for vendors is to record your agreements concerning discounts, prices, and payment methods. Learn more at [Setting Up Purchasing](purchasing-setup-purchasing.md).

Vendor cards hold the information required to buy products from each vendor. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
<br /><br />  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

## Adding new vendors

You can add new vendors manually, by filling out the **Vendor Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create templates for different types of vendor profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new vendors, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> If vendor templates exist for different vendor types, when you create a new vendor you can select the appropriate template. If only one vendor template exists, new vendors always use that template.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected vendors. To create a template, fill in the information you want to reuse on the **Vendor Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the Vendor Card Page as a template](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Vendor Template** page when you create a template. For example, if you want to add a field that isn't already displayed on the page. Learn more at [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can also create a vendor from a contact. Learn more at [Creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).

Remit-to addresses are used when you print checks to pay your vendors, and vendors can have multiple remit-to addresses for payments. For example, a vendor might supply an item from a subsidiary company, but wants to receive payment at their headquarters. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you set up multiple mailing addresses for each vendor, and you can choose the correct location to send payments to on an invoice-by-invoice basis.

You specify remit-to addresses on **Vendor Card** pages, and on the **Shipping & Payments** FastTab on purchase orders and invoices. The remit-to code on the vendor ledger entry is assigned when you create payment journal lines by using:

* The **Pay Vendor** or **Create Payment** actions on the **Vendors** list page or **Vendor Card** page.
* The **Apply Entries** action on a payment journal.

You can overwrite this value.

### To create a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you don't know the invoicing address to be used for every invoice from a vendor, don't fill in the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab. Instead, choose the pay-to vendor number after you fill in a purchase quote, order, or invoice header.

The vendor is now registered, and the vendor card is ready to use on purchase documents.

If you want to use this vendor card as a template when you create new vendor cards, you can save it as a vendor template. Learn more in the [To save the vendor card as a template](#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

### Deleting and editing vendor information

You can edit the information on vendor cards at any time. However, if you posted a transaction for a vendor, you can't delete the card because you might need the ledger entries for auditing. To delete vendor cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) on a vendor bank account without the change affecting your historical credit transfer register entries. Credit transfer register entries store the *Recipient IBAN* and the *Recipient Bank Account No.* specified in the **Vendor Bank Account** and **Recipient Name** fields from the **Vendor Card** page when the entries were created.

> [!TIP]
> You can add alternative addresses on vendor cards by choosing the **Order Addresses** action.

## To save the vendor card as a template

- This measure calculates the total quantity taken from the warehouse for "Assemble to Order" components by summing the qtyBase from Warehouse Activity Lines where actionType is Take, assembleToOrder is TRUE, and atoComponent is TRUE. This measure captures only the quantities picked specifically for assembling made-to-order products.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Activity Line

### Available Qty. to Take
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the quantity of an item that is available to be picked. It subtracts the [Pick Quantity (Base)](#pick-quantity-base), [ATO Components Pick Qty.](#ato-components-pick-qty), and [Negative Adjmt. Qty. (Base)](#negative-adjmt-qty-base) measures from [Warehouse Quantity](#warehouse-quantity), but only for the bins that are not marked as adjustment bins.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Entry
- Bin

# Invoicing prepayments

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order, or you can distribute the prepayment across each line on the order. You can also send additional prepayment invoices if, for example, additional items are added to the order. You can increase quantities or add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete a line for which a prepayment has already been invoiced, you must issue a prepayment credit memo before you can delete the line.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Post transactions directly to the general ledger

You use general journals to post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts.  

A typical use of the general journal is to post employees expenses during business activities for reimbursement. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employee Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

General journals post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts. Entries are created even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group. You can personalize your version of a general journal by setting up a journal batch or template. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

Entries that you post with documents require a credit memo process. However, you can reverse entries that you post with the general journal. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

## To post a transaction directly to a general ledger account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all transactions that you want to post.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple transaction lines before a balance-account line, for example for one bank account, select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. The **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the transactions.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the transactions on the specified G/L accounts.

# Monitor project progress and performance

The work in process (WIP) feature lets you estimate the financial value of ongoing projects in the general ledger.

As a project progresses, materials and resources are consumed and expenses incurred that you must post to the project. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing. But if you only post expenses, your financial statement is inaccurate. To track the actual value of the project, calculate WIP and post it to the general ledger. The following are the standard WIP methods:

* Cost value
* Sales value
* Recognizable cost
* Percentage of completion
* Completed contract

You can also create a WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default. Learn more at [Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md).

If you want to view the result using a different method, change the method and recalculate WIP. You can recalculate WIP as often as you like. The value isn't automatically posted to the general ledger. After you calculate WIP using the method you prefer, you can post to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this new method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects Setup**, then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

## Define a WIP method for a project

When you create a new project, you must specify which project WIP method applies. In some cases, the project WIP method you use is already set as the default.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Learn more at [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).  
3. On the **Project Card** page, in the **WIP Method** field from the **Posting** FastTab, select a WIP method from the list. If a default method is defined, you can select another option if needed.  

### Define a WIP method for a project task

You can define a WIP method for a project task, exclude project tasks from WIP calculation, or group tasks to be calculated together.

If you want to calculate WIP for each project task individually, WIP posting provides defined dimensions for the specific tasks.

The **WIP-Total** specifies project tasks you want to group together when calculating WIP and recognition. In any group of tasks, there needs to be one task that satisfies two conditions:
<!--But doesn't the parenthetical below contradict this -* if there is no total, the application sets the total for you, meaning the condition does not HAVE to be satisfied, right? Or am I missing something?-->

* **WIP-Total** is set to **Total**. If there are no project tasks with **WIP-Total** set to Total, Total is set automatically on the last project task line when WIP is calculated for the first time.
* The number in the **Project Task No.** field is the final one in the group or range of project tasks.

The following table describes the options:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **\<blank\>** | Leave blank if the project task is part of a group of tasks. |
| **Total** | Defines the range or group of tasks included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting** is included in the WIP total, unless the task's **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**. |
| **Excluded** | Applies only to a task with **Project Task Type** of **Posting**, in which case the task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated. |

In the following example, project tasks are divided into two WIP total groupings, demonstrating how the **WIP-Total** field works:

|Project task no.|Description|Project task type|**WIP-Total** field|  
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
|1000|Preparation|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1010|.    Cleaning|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1099|Total preparation|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1100|Carpeting|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1110|.    Gluing floor|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1120|.    Laying out carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1199|Total carpeting|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1200|Finish|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1210|.    Vacuum cleaning carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1299|Total finish|End-Total|**Total**|
|1300|Error correction|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1310|.    Error correction|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1399|Total error correction|End-Total|**Total**|

You notice:

* For *1000* through *1299*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks. Note, however, that two of the tasks, 1010 and 1110, are excluded from the WIP calculation because their project task type is **Posting**.
* For *1300* through *1399*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks.

## Calculate WIP

You can determine the WIP amount to post to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting by using the **Project Calculate WIP** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Calculate WIP**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
3. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job only calculates the WIP, it doesn't post it to the general ledger. To post WIP, run the **Post WIP to G/L** batch job after you've calculated the WIP. Learn more in the following procedure.

### Review warnings

# Process Sales Opportunities

After you create an opportunity, there are several features for managing the opportunity and moving it through to completion.

## View opportunities

Existing sale opportunities are available on the **Opportunity List** page. The following table describes ways to access the page to process sales opportunities.

| To view opportunities for | Then |
| --- | --- |
| All salespeople and contacts |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunity List**, and then choose the related link. |
| A specific sales person |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link. Select the salesperson, choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose the **List** action. |
| A specific contact |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link. Select the contact from the list, and then choose the **Opportunities** action. |

Each of these tasks opens the **Opportunity List** page.

## Close opportunities

You can close opportunities when the negotiations are over. When you close an opportunity, you can specify whether it was won or lost, and the reasons for closing it. To specify a reason, you must set up closed opportunity codes.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and the choose the **Close** action. The **Close Opportunity** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

   The **Close Opportunity Code** and **Date Closed** fields are required fields and must be filled in before you can choose the **OK** button.

   In the **Close Opportunity Code** field, you can choose from one of the existing close opportunity codes or add a new code. To add a new code, from the drop-down list, choose **Select from full list**, and then choose **new**. On the new blank line, fill in the **Code**, **Type**, and **Description** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Create quotes for opportunities

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sales quotes from opportunities where the contact type is Company.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.

## Create sales orders for opportunities

You can make sales orders from the sales quotes that you have created for your opportunities. Before you can create sales orders for your contacts, you must create the contact as a customer. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, find the opportunity that you have created a sales quote for.
2. Choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens to show the sales quote that you have assigned to the opportunity.
3. Fill in the additional fields, and then choose the **Make Order** action.

When handling sales opportunities, you may need to create a quote for the contact that the opportunity is linked to.

## Delete opportunities

You can delete opportunities, for example, after you conclude a deal. However, you can only delete closed opportunities. There are two ways to delete closed opportunities. You can delete individual closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page or you can run the **Delete Opportunities** batch job to delete multiple opportunities based on specified criteria.

To delete closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Delete** action.

To delete closed opportunities by using the **Delete Opportunities** batch job, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Administration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Delete Opportunities** action, and then set the filters that specify the closed opportunities to delete.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

After you delete an opportunity, it's removed it from the **Opportunity List** page.

## Move an opportunity through sales cycle stages

If an opportunity follows a sales cycle, you can move it to the next or previous stage, and even skip a stage.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, choose the **Update** action. The **Update Opportunity** opens,
2. Use the **Action Type** field to move the opportunity through the sales cycle stages:
   * **Next** moves the opportunity forward one stage.
   * **Skip** moves the opportunity forward one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field. You can only skip stages that have been set up to allow skipping.
   * **Previous** moves the opportunity back one stage.
   * **Jump** moves the opportunity back one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field.
   * **Update** enables you to change information (such as to modify your evaluation of their chances of success and estimated values) without moving to another stage.
3. Fill in the other fields as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Setting Up Troubleshooting for Service Items
You can set up troubleshooting guidelines that help technicians solve problems when providing service. For example, guidelines might be a list of steps to perform a repair, or a series of questions to ask about the items. After you set up troubleshooting guidelines, you can assign them to service item groups, service items, and items. There is an inheritance hierarchy for guidelines. If you assign them to a service item group, the items included in the group will inherit the guidelines unless you specify them for the items. Similarly, service items will inherit guidelines from items.  

## To set up troubleshooting guidelines
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Troubleshooting**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign troubleshooting guidelines to items, service items, or service item groups
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, **Service Items**, or **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant entity, and then choose the **Troubleshooting** action.

# Manage Many Incoming Document Records

As you create or process incoming document records, the number of lines on the **Incoming Documents** page may grow to an extent where you lose overview. Therefore, you can set incoming document records to *Processed* to remove them from the default view. When you choose the **Show All** action, you can view both processed and unprocessed records.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot edit information, attach files, or perform other processes on incoming document records that are set to *Processed*. You must first set it to *Unprocessed*.

The **Processed** check box is automatically selected on incoming document records that have been processed, but you can also select or deselect the check box manually. Depending on your business process, an incoming document record may be processed when a related document has been created for it or a file has been attached.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you open the **Incoming Documents** page with the **My Incoming Documents** action on the Role Center, only unprocessed incoming document records are shown by default. This is referred to in this topic as "the default view".

## To remove incoming document records from the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to remove from the default view.
2. Choose the **Set to Processed** action.

    The incoming document records are removed from the default view, and the **Processed** check box is selected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

## To view all incoming document records

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.

All incoming document records are displayed, including records where the **Processed** check box isn't selected.

## To add incoming document records to the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.
2. Select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to appear in the default view.
3. Choose the **Set to Unprocessed** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

# Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

This article helps you learn some of the basics about working with reports. Learn about viewing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (including scorecards and dashboards) and editing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. To learn more about general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, go to [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports give you insight into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] include a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part that can display [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. The role center is a typical page where you find a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part. Some list pages, like **Items**, also include a Power BI part.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] works together with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Reports for displaying in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are stored in a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can switch the report displayed in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part to any Power BI report available in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. The first time you sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and until you connect to a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], parts are empty, as shown here:

![Power BI part in Business Central.](./media/power-bi-part.png)

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already set up to integrate with Power BI.

### Sign up Power BI

Before you can use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you need to sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If you didn't already sign up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

After you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account, you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Learn more in [Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-sign-in).

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] hosts all the reports available to you. To show a report in your personal workspace, select **My Workspace**, and then **Reports**. Then, select the report that you want to view. If you have access to one or more shared Power BI workspaces, you can also show reports in those workspaces.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you automatically get a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. Learn more in [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="connect"></a>Connect to Power BI - one-time only

When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an empty [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part (as shown in the previous figure) is most likely available on various pages. The first thing to do is to connect to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account. After you connect, you can access reports. You only have to do this step one time.

1. Select the **Get Started with Power BI** link in the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part.
2. The **Set Up [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in Business Central** assisted setup starts. Select **Next** to continue.
3. On the **Check your Power BI License** page, do one of the following steps:

    - If you didn't sign up for Power BI yet, select the [Go to Power BI homepage](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Sign up for an account, then come back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and finish the setup.

    - If you already have a license, select **Next**.
4. In the next page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uploads a demo report to Power BI. This step takes a few minutes, so it runs in the background. To complete the setup, select **Next**, then **Finish**.

The connection process starts. During the process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] to determine if you have a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  and license. Once your license is verified, the default Power BI report displays on the page. If there a report isn't shown, you can select a report from the part.

> [!TIP]
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, this step automatically uploads default [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your Power BI workspace.

## <a name="apps"></a>Use Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview-table](includes/powerbi-apps-overview-table.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are free to install and use. The only requirement is that users must have a paid Power BI license. To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).


<!--#### From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Connecting to Power BI from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is similar to online. However, you might be prompted on the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page to grant access to [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. To grant access, select **Authorize Azure Services**, and then **Accept**.

Once connected, you can select a report from the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on pages.-->

## Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

### Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You should make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*. Depending on how your organization set-up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

#### Refresh manually

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

#### Schedule a refresh

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

Learn more in [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

### Show reports on list pages

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox on several key list pages. This FactBox provides extra insight into the data in the list. As you move between rows in the list, the report is updated and filtered for the selected entry.

To learn more about how to create reports for list pages, go to [Creating [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

> [!TIP]
> If the Power BI FactBox isn't available, it might be hidden on your workspace by personalization. Select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then select **Personalize** action. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
>
> Or, if you have an older version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the action bar, select **Actions**, then **Display**, and then **Show/Hide [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports**.

### Switch reports

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on a page can display any Power BI report that's available to you. To switch to view another report, choose the **Select Report** action from the drop-down command list at the top of the part.  

The **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Reports Selection** page shows a list of all the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that you have access to. This list is retrieved from any of your own workspaces or workspaces that others shared with you in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Select the **Enable** box for each report that you want to display on the page, and then choose **OK**. You return to the page, and the last report you enabled appears. Using the drop-down command list, use the **Previous** and **Next** commands to navigate between reports.  

### Get more reports

If you don't have any reports on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Reports Selection** page, or can't find the report you want, choose **Get Reports**. This action lets you look for reports from two locations: *My Organization* or from *Services*.

- Select **My Organization** to go to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. From here, you can view the reports within your organization that you have rights to view. You can then add them to your workspace.
- Select **Services** to go to Microsoft AppSource where you can install Power BI apps.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI Desktop, you can also create new [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. Then, once those reports are published to your Power BI workspace, they appear on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page.  

### Manage and modify reports

You can make changes to a report in the Power BI part. The changes that you make are then published to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If the report is shared with other users, they also experience the changes unless you save the changes to a new report.

To modify a report, choose the **Manage Report** action from the drop-down command list in the Power BI part. Then start making changes. Once you finish making changes, select **File** > **Save**. If it's a shared report, and you don't want to make the change for all users, select **Save As** to avoid making this change for all users.

When you return to the role center, the updated report appears. If you used **Save As**, you have to choose **Select Report**, and then enable the new report to see it.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

### <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have any .pbix files, you can upload and share them with all users of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reports are shared within each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

To upload a report, select the **Upload Report** action from the drop-down command list on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part. Then, locate the .pbix file that defines the reports that you want to share. You can change the default name of the file.  

After the report uploads to your Power BI workspace, it automatically uploads to other users' Power BI workspaces.

> Uploading a report through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you have SUPER user permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You don't need any special permission to upload reports to your workspace through the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.
1. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. Learn more in [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). -->

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. To complete the sharing, follow the on-screen instructions. Learn more in [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing requires that both you and the people you're sharing the report with have [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type). Otherwise, the content must be in [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). Learn more in [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).

## Fixing problems

However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account 

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account isn't set up for you. To get a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account, you must have a license, and you must have signed in to Power BI before to create a Power BI workspace.

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Choose Select Report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or it deployed but didn't refresh successfully. Navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

#### You can't see a report on the Select Report page on a list page

It's probably because the report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page. Clear the filter to get a full list of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports available.

# Posting sales

Under the **Posting** menu in a sales document, you can choose between the following posting functions:

* **Post**
* **Post and New**
* **Post and Send**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post Batch**
* **Test Report**

> [!NOTE]
> For sales orders, you can also see options related to the prepayments functionality. For more information, see [Invoicing Prepayments](finance-invoice-prepayments.md).

When you have completed all the lines and entered all the information on the sales order, you can post it. This creates a shipment and an invoice.

When a sales order is posted, the customer's account, the general ledger, and the item ledger entries are updated.

For each sales order, a sales entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

For each sales order line, an item ledger entry will be created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry will be created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition to this, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

You can either post, or post and send. If you choose to post and send, a PDF file is generated that you can then send. You can also choose the **Post Batch** function, which lets you post several orders at the same time. For more information, see [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted sales lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. After this, you'll be able to see the posted entries in the various pages that contain posted entries, such as the **Cust. Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Posted Sales Shipments**, and **Posted Sales Invoices** pages.  

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Package Tracking No.** field. For more information, see [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Batch post production consumption

If the flushing method is **Manual**, use a consumption journal to post the components manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field on the location card to indicate that the location requires inventory pick processing, you don't need to use this batch job. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles consumption when you post the inventory pick. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  

You can also set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    Use the **Calc. Consumption** action to generate journal lines from production orders based on the actual output (the quantity of finished goods that you reported) or on the expected output (the quantity of finished goods that you expect to produce).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured the location to require warehouse pick processing, only quantities that are already picked through a warehouse activity can be entered in the **Quantity** field in the **Consumption Journal** page. It can't be a calculated quantity. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production or Assembly in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).

3. Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related inventories are reduced.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# Split Warehouse Activity Lines

In warehouse put-aways, movements, or picks, and in inventory put-aways and inventory picks, bins are suggested for picking or putting away items. The quantity that's actually in the suggested bin may not be sufficient, or there isn't enough room in the bin to put away the required quantity. In these cases, you can split the line so that the items for one line are either taken from or placed in more than one bin.  

The following procedure applies to the following warehouse documents:

* Warehouse put-aways
* Warehouse movements
* Warehouse picks
* Inventory put-aways
* Inventory movements
* Inventory picks  

## To split warehouse activity lines  

1. Open a warehouse activity line where you are trying to handle an insufficient quantity.  
2. In the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter the reduced quantity that you're able to handle.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Actions** action, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Split Line** action. A new line appears. The line is a copy of the original line except that the **Qty. to Handle** field contains the quantity that you removed from the original line.  
4. Assign a bin and, if you're using directed put-away and pick, a zone, or continue splitting the line as necessary until you find appropriate bins for all of the quantity.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the location uses directed put-away and pick and you split the lines, you must be familiar with the warehouse and be able to choose a bin that matches the storage requirements of the item and that fulfills the general requirements of the warehouse document. For example, you would not split a line on a pick document and place some items in bulk storage.

# Work with accounting periods and fiscal years

Accounting periods, also known as reporting periods, are periods of time for which a company or organization reports financial performance by generating, for example, their income statement or balance sheet. Typically, accounting periods refer to the company's fiscal year, which can contain several accounting periods, such as months or quarters.

For many companies the fiscal year doesn't align with the calendar year, for instance when the fiscal year ends on June 30 rather than December 31. For newly created companies, the fiscal year might even actually be longer than 12 months.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only requires accounting periods if you want to close an income statement, or run data compression tasks.

You can use accounting periods in reporting such as when you're reviewing posted entries on the **Balance/Budget** page where the reporting interval is specified. One of the options you might specify is to report by accounting period. You can also build a financial report that compares results for different accounting periods.

## Creating a new fiscal year

You can create accounting periods in bulk by using the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job, or by doing so manually.

### How to create accounting periods in bulk

Use the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job to divide a fiscal year into periods of equal length.  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Create Year** action.
3. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts.  
4. In the **No. of Periods** field, enter the number of accounting periods to divide the fiscal year into. There can be up to 365 periods in a year.  
5. In the **Period Length** field, enter a duration for each period. Duration identifiers include 1M for one month, 1Q for one quarter, and 1Y for one year.  
6. Choose **OK**.  

### How to create accounting periods manually

If the accounting periods in your fiscal year have different durations, such as the 4-4-5 calendar used in retail, you can manually set it up.  
  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts. The **Name** field will show the name of the month.  
3. Choose the **New Fiscal Year** check box to indicate that this is the first period in the year. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use this period to determine which periods to close at year-end.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each remaining period.  

## Closing a fiscal year

Closing the fiscal year is one of the tasks for closing the books. After you close a fiscal year, the **Closed** and **Date Locked** check boxes are selected for all periods in the year. You can't reopen a year or clear the check boxes.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must always have at least one open fiscal year. When closing a year, ensure that a new year has been created. Also, note that after you close one year, you cannot change the starting date of the following year.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Close Year** action.  

## Posting entries to a closed fiscal year

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior Year Entry** check box is selected. By default, the check box isn't displayed on the page, but you can add it. The next steps are to close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. Repeat these steps each time you post entries to a closed fiscal year.

# Set up basic warehouses with operations areas

If you have internal operation areas, such as production or assembly areas, you can use the following basic warehouse documents to record your warehouse activities:  

- **Inventory Movement** page.  
- **Inventory Pick** page.  
- **Inventory Put-away** page.

To use these documents, you must set up one or more of the following fields on the the **Location Card** page for the location:

- The **Bin Mandatory** field.
- The **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Movement** option in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still post output and consumption directly from the source documents and journals.  

To use these pages with internal operations such as to pick and move components to production, depending on how much control you need you must do some or all the following steps:  

- Enable the inventory pick, move, and put-away documents.  
- Define default bin structures for components and end items flowing to and from operation resources.  
- Make to- and from- bins that are dedicated to specific operation resources. Dedicated bins prevent the items from being picked for outbound documents.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for certain activities, such as components in an assembly department. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a certain bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities. To learn more, go to [To create dedicated component bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md#to-create-dedicated-component-bins).

The following procedures are based on setting up basic warehouse activities around a production area. The steps are similar for other operation areas, such as assembly, service management, and jobs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures assume that the **Bin Mandatory** toggle is turned on for the location.  

## To enable inventory documents for internal operation activities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location card you want to set up.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field to indicate that when someone releases an internal source document with a bin code, an inventory put-away or movement document can be created.  
4. To require that an inventory pick or an inventory movement document when you create an outbound or internal source document with a bin code, fill in the following fields:

   - In the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling field**, choose **Inventory Pick/Movement**.
   - In the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, choose **Inventory Movement**.  

## To define a default bin structure in the production area

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.  
3. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area with plenty of components that the machine operator can consume from without requesting a warehouse activity to bring them to the bin. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for automatic posting, or flushing. This setup means that the **Flushing Method** field contains **Forward**, **Backward**, or **Manual**.  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also record flushing without requiring a pick. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To flush without picking, the item must use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

4. In the **To-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where components that are picked for production at this location are placed by default before they can be consumed. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for manual picking. The **Flushing Method** field contains **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward**, or **Pick + Manual** for warehouse picks and inventory movements.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line defines the *take* bin from where components are decreased when posting consumption. When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area where the warehouse worker must place the components.  

5. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **From-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where finished end items are taken from by default when the process involves a warehouse activity. In basic warehouse configurations, the activity is recorded as an inventory put-away or an inventory movement.  

Now, production order component lines with the default bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

This flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled according to your setup.  

![Bin flow chart.](media/binflow.png "BinFlow")

## To define a default bin structure in the assembly area

Components for assembly orders can't be picked or posted with inventory picks. Instead, use the **Inventory Movement** page. To learn more, go to [Pick or move for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Basic Warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, you must follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

To learn more, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

### To set up that an inventory movement is automatically created when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** checkbox.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where components are placed by default before they can be consumed in assembly

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order lines when this location is entered in the **Location Code** field on the assembly order line.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **To-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to stock

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order headers when this location code is filled into the **Location Code** field on the assembly order header.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for specific warehouse activities, such as consumption of components in an assembly area. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a default bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is only possible for locations where the **Bin Mandatory** field is selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to a linked sales order

From this bin, the assembly items are shipped immediately, via an inventory pick, to fulfill the sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use this field if the location is set up to use directed pick and put-away.

The bin code is copied from the sales order line to the assembly order header to communicate to assembly workers where to place the output to ready it for shipping. It's also copied to the inventory pick line to communicate to warehouse workers where to take it from to ship it.

> [!NOTE]
> The Assemble-to-Order Shipment bin is always empty. When you post an assemble-to-order sales line, then the bin content is first positively adjusted with the assembly output. Immediately after, it's negatively adjusted with the shipped quantity.

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the Bin Code field on sales order lines that contain a quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field or if the item to be sold has **Assemble-to-Order** in the **Replenishment System** field.

If the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** is blank, then the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field is used instead. If both setup fields are blank, then the last used bin with content is used in the **Bin Code** field on sales order lines.

The same bin code is in turn copied to the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line that manages the shipment of the assemble-to-order quantity. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** field.

## To create dedicated component bins

You can specify that quantities in a bin are protected from being picked for other demands than demand from their current purpose.

Quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

For example, is a work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

Making a bin dedicated provides similar functionality to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. To learn more, go to [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production components with the Inventory Pick page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. Select the location that you want to update.  
2. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the **Dedicated** field for each bin that you want to use exclusively for certain internal operations and where you want quantities to be reserved for that internal operation once placed there.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The bin must be empty before you can select or clear the **Dedicated** field.

# Need more time to decide whether to subscribe?

It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation, you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You can't extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again, which is also a one-time thing. If you aren't already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

## To extend your trial period

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).

    Sign in with the email account that you used when you signed up for the trial.  

    If you signed up with an email account from a [30-day trial of Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/commerce/sign-up-for-office-365-trial), then you must first extend your Microsoft 365 trial, or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription. For more information, see [Extend your trial for Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/extend-your-trial).
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.

    If you dismissed the notification, you must sign out and then sign in again.

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the notification, you can force [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to run the **Extend Trial** assisted setup guide by adding the ```?page=1828``` parameter to the URL, such as in the following example: [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828)

## What happens if my trial period is expired?

If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification.  

After you create your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company.  

If your organization has a reseller relationship with a partner, they can sign in to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a delegated administrator and run the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. For more information, see [Extending trials (as an administrator)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration#extending-trials).  

However, after this second extension gives your organization up to 90 days of trial, you must either subscribe to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or stop using it. If you decide to not continue, we recommend that you export any data that you rely on in your business.

When your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. 90 days after the extended trial expires, we'll delete your company and data unless you subscribe.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page
Item tracking records and reservation records are created in the reservation system, and their availability is calculated dynamically. Data that is entered on the **Item Tracking Lines** page is managed in a temporary version of the **Tracking Specification** table. When the page is closed, the active data is committed to the **Reservation Entry** table and the historic data is committed to the **Tracking Specification** table. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  
  
Lookups from the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields show availability based on both the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. The matrix of quantity fields on the header of the **Item Tracking Lines** page dynamically displays the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are being entered on the lines of the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** fields in the header of the page.  
  
To coordinate the flow of serial and lot numbers through inventory, the following rules exist for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page:  
  
* For both inbound and outbound item tracking lines, you cannot enter a serial number, with or without a lot number, more than once in the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. If you try to enter any combination of serial or lot numbers that is already present on the page, then an error message blocks the data entry.  
* For inbound item tracking lines, you cannot post the related document if an item of the same variant and with the same serial number is already in inventory. If you try to post a positive line for an inventory item with the same variant and serial number, then an error message blocks the posting. However, for both inbound and outbound item tracking lines on open documents, you can have the same combination of serial or lot numbers that relate to different source document lines, that is, existing in different instances of the **Item Tracking Lines** page until the related document is posted.  
* If the item is set up for serial number-specific tracking or lot number- specific tracking, then you cannot post an outbound document line unless an item with the defined serial or lot number exists in inventory. If you try to post an outbound document line for an item with a serial lot number that is not in inventory, then an error message blocks the posting.  
  
The rules for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page also support the coupling principles that govern order tracking, planning, and reservation. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking and Planning](design-details-item-tracking-and-planning.md).

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.

# Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries
When parts of a document line quantity are posted, only that particular quantity is transferred to the item ledger entries and its item tracking numbers. However, you will want to access all relevant item tracking information directly from the active document line. That is, not only will you want to see the entries that are related to the remaining quantity, you will also want information about the units that have been posted. When you view or modify the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the collective contents of the **Tracking Specification** table (T336) and **Reservation Entry** table (T337) are presented in a temporary version of T336. This ensures that historic and active item tracking data is accessed as one.  

 The following table shows how T336 and T337 are used in a purchase scenario. The bold figures represent values that the user manually enters on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 Step 1: Create a purchase order line of seven pieces with item tracking numbers.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**T337**|7|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|0|0|0|0|0|  

 Step 2: Receive four pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**4**|**0**|0|0|  
|**T337**|3|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|4|0|0|4|0|  

 Step 3: Receive two pieces and invoice two pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**2**|**2**|4|0|  
|**T337**|1|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|6|0|0|6|2|  

 Step 4: Receive one piece.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**1**|**0**|6|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|2|  

 Invoice 5 pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|0|**5**|7|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|7|

# Walkthrough: Planning Supplies Manually

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand. You can initiate supply planning at fixed intervals, for example, every morning or every Monday, or when you are notified by sales or production, depending on the type of demand. In this walkthrough you will use the **Order Planning** page, a simple supply planning tool that is based on manual decision-making instead of parameter-based automatic planning.  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Planning a purchase order for manufacturing components.  
-   Planning a transfer order to fulfill sales demand.  
-   Planning a production order for a multilevel item.  

## Roles  
 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks performed by the following user roles:  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Sales Order Processor  

## Prerequisites  
 Before you begin this walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following modifications must be made to the database:  

-   Delete all existing sales orders for bicycles.  
-   Create one sales order for 10 bicycles at EAST location.  
-   Delete all planned and firm planned production orders. Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted.  

 As a rule, use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records.  

## Story  
 Eduardo, the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company, is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand.  

 Because the products have few BOM levels and the flow of orders is relatively low, Eduardo uses the **Order Planning** page to manually create supply orders, one product level at a time.  

 In a more complex manufacturing environment, the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period, safety lead time, reorder point, and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels.  

## Setting Up the Sample Data  
 The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand. During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough, you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates.  

## Use the Order Planning Page  

The **Order Planning** page can be accessed from several different locations:  

-   Manufacturing, Planning  
-   Sales & Marketing, Order Processing  
-   Purchase, Planning  
-   In addition, you can open this page for a specific production order by choosing the **Planning** action.

### To use the Order Planning page  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  

     When the **Order Planning** page first opens, a plan must be calculated to show the new demand since it was last calculated.  

2.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced, such as new sales, changed sales, or production orders.  

     Based on total availability, the quantity needed for each demand line is calculated. This calculation is performed order-by-order. This means that the order which includes the demand line with the earliest due date or shipment date will be calculated first. After that, additional demand lines will be calculated in the same order, regardless of the due date or shipment date.  

3.  Be sure that the **Order Planning** page is maximized and that column fields are resized to show all the default field names.  

     When the calculation is completed, the page displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date.  

     Notice that CRONUS has several orders with unfulfilled demand. Each bold planning line represents an order, sales order, or production order, including at least one order line with insufficient availability.  

4.  In the **Show Demand As** field, select the **All Demand** filter.  

     With the **Demand Type** field, you can choose which order types that you want to display.  

     Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown. If no orders exist when a plan is calculated, a message will display and no planning lines will appear.  

## Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand  
 In this procedure, you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components.  

### To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production  

1.  Expand the first line (choose the + symbol).  
2.  Choose the first demand line, with item **LSU-15**, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  
3.  Close the opened production order to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
4.  In the **Replenishment System** field, select **Purchase**.  

     The default value is from the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of the following options:  

    -   **Purchase** – To create a purchase order.  
    -   **Transfer** – To create a transfer order.  
    -   **Prod. Order** – To create a production order.  

5.  In the **Supply From** field, select one of the following options according to the selected replenishment system:  

    -   **Vendor** – For purchases  
    -   **Location** – For transfers  

     If the field is not filled in, an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the components have a default vendor number set up on the item cards, the lines will be preset.  

6.  Choose the **Supply From**  field.  
7.  On the **Item Vendor Catalogue** page, choose the **New** action, and then select vendor **30000**.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
9. Copy vendor **30000** to the other lines for loudspeaker components on this production order.  

     You are now ready to create a purchase order.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
11. On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **Active Order** option.  
12. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Purchase Order** field, choose the **Make Purch. Order** option.  
13. Choose the **OK** button to create purchase orders for all the components of the order.  

     The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders.  

## Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan for demand from a sales order. Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines, as in production demand.  

### To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Move the pointer to the planning line for order **2008**.  
2.  Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line.  

     Sales order **2008** is for ten loudspeakers, item **LS-120**, ordered by John Haddock Insurance Co.  

     The item's defined replenishment system and default vendor will display.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  At the bottom of the page, there are four information fields. In the **Earliest Date Available** field, the ten pieces that are needed will be available, on an inbound supply order, nine days later than the current due date. If this is too late for the customer, the **Available for Transfer** field shows 13 pieces of the item at another location. You will want to plan for this stock.  

3.  Choose the **Available for Transfer** field to open the **Get Alternative Supply** page.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to book the ten items that are available.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the demand line, the suggested purchase has been exchanged with a transfer from MAIN location. The **Make Orders** function creates a transfer order from MAIN to the demanded location. The **Substitutes Exists** field works in the same way.  

5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
6.  On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **The Active Order** option.  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Transfer Order** field, select the **Make Trans. Orders** option.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to create the transfer order to supply the sales order.  

     The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders.  

## Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels, each creating dependent production demand.  

### To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Select the planning line with sales demand for order **1001**, created earlier as prerequisite data.  

     This demand is a sales line, but the item has a defined replenishment system of **Prod. Order**. Proceed to add an extra bell to the component need of each bicycle.  

2.  Choose the **Components** action to open the **Planning Components** page.  
3.  On the line with the Bell item, change the **Quantity per** field from **1** to **2**.  
4.  On the **Order Planning** page, consider your planning alternatives. In this case, you have no alternative means of supply, no transfer, substitute, or later delivery. You must create the suggested supply order, a production order.  
5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action to create the production order.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, notice that the planning line for sales order **1001** no longer exists and that the initial sales demand has been covered.  

6.  Close the **Order Planning** page.  

     Now, you could choose to stay in this view and complete all the planning tasks. Instead, you will now take on the Production Planner role by going to the production order that you just created and access the **Order Planning** page.  

 As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order.  

### To plan a specific production order  

1.  Open the production order **101001**, for ten bicycles, that you just created by using the **Make Orders** function.  
2.  Open the **Prod. Order Components** page to check that the extra bell is reflected on the production order.  
3.  Choose the **Planning** action.  

     The **Order Planning** page opens in a view that is always filtered on the specific production demand. Sales demand is not displayed. You must calculate a plan before you can see any additional demand.  

4.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     Notice that four new production orders appear as unplanned production demand derived from order **101001**. The new lines represent new production demand from the subassemblies that must be created to produce the order.  

5.  Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the production demand for the production orders.  

     To provide additional information about the demand lines, you may want to add the **Demand Quantity** and **Demand Qty. Available** fields to your view.  

     Now you must supply ten of each component.  

     Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod. Order. These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle.  

     The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders.  

6.  Choose the **Make Orders** action.  

     Before you choose the **OK** button, notice the text on the **Order Planning** FastTab. This text is important because you know that the bicycle has several produced components, subassemblies, in its product structure that might be in demand when you create this production order.  

7.  On the **Make Supply Order** page, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button to create production orders for the second product level of the order.  

     Note that the top-level production demand for production order 101001 no longer exists. This means that the initial production demand for subassemblies has been planned for.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, you calculate a plan again in order to plan the bicycle structure.  

8.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action to recalculate the plan as instructed by the embedded Help text.  

     The two new lines represent additional production demand derived from the subassemblies planned in the previous steps. It is suggested that you make two production orders to supply the wheel hubs, one for 10 front hubs and one for 10 back hubs.  

9. Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the demand for the two production orders.  

     The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components. You decide to make the proposed orders.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action.  
11. In the **Make Orders for** field, select the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button. Check if additional demand exists for the production of the parent item, the bicycle, which is being sold on sales order 1001.  
12. Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The message indicates that all required items are now supplied. Verify the firm planned production orders that are created.  

13. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

     On the **Firm Planned Prod. Orders** page review how start times and end times of individual orders are scheduled according to the product structure. The lowest-level components are produced first. Therefore, you must plan multilevel orders as demonstrated in this planning workflow.

# Add extended text

Use extended texts to communicate additional information for items, stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources. For example, the extra details might be about special prices, terms, or handling instructions. Provide the information by adding extra lines as extended text. You can also set up conditions for use of the extra lines.  

The following section describes how to add extended text to a description of an item. The same steps apply to stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources.  

## To define extended text for a description

1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field, or turn on the **All Language Codes** toggle if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Text** field, enter the extended text.
7. On the **Sales**, **Purchases**, and **Service** FastTabs, turn on the toggles for the documents you want to include the extended text.
8. Close the page.

You can now add this extended text to documents. The following procedure explains how to add extended text to a sales order, but the same steps apply to any other document that you specified for the extended text.  

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line

1. Open a sales order that has a sales line for an item with extended text. To learn more, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.

# Create a demand forecast

You can create sales and production forecasts with the **Demand Forecasts** list page. Then, for each forecast, you specify various settings for that forecast in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page.  

Forecasting functionality is used to create anticipated demand; actual demand is created from sales and production orders. During creation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS), the forecast is netted against the sales and production orders. The **Forecast Type** field on the forecast determines which type of requirements to take into consideration in the netting process. If the forecast is for a *sales item*, only sales orders net the forecast. If it is for *components*, only dependent demand from production order components net the forecast.  

Forecasting allows your company to create "what if" scenarios and efficiently and cost-effectively plan for and meet demand. Accurate forecasting can make a critical difference in customer satisfaction levels with regard to order promising dates and on-time delivery.  

You can also define the right level of details in the **Forecast by Location** and **Forecast by Variant** fields in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page. Filters and other settings are stored in the **Demand Forecast Name** table, so you can easily stop and continue your work later. 

## Sales forecasts and production forecasts

The forecasting functionality in application can be used to create sales or production forecasts, in combination or independently. For example, most make-to-order companies do not carry finished goods inventory, because each item is produced when it is ordered. Anticipating orders (sales forecasting) is critical for a reasonable turnaround time on the finished goods (production forecasting). As an example, component parts with lengthy delivery times, if not on order or on inventory, can delay production.  

- The sales forecast is the sales department's best guess at what will be sold in the future, and is specified by item and by period. However, the sales forecast is not always adequate for production.  
- The production forecast is the production planner's projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales.  

In most cases, then, the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production, yet still satisfies the sales forecast.  

You create forecasts manually on the **Demand Forecast** page. Multiple forecasts can exist in the system, and are differentiated by name and type. Forecasts can be copied and edited as necessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only one forecast is valid for planning purposes at any time.

The forecast consists of a number of records each stating item number, forecast date, and forecasted quantity. The forecast of an item covers a period, which is defined by the forecast date and the forecast date of the next (later) forecast record. From a planning point of view, the forecasted quantity should be available at the start of the demand period.  

You must designate a forecast as *Sales Item*, *Component*, or *Both*. The forecast type *Sales Item* is used for sales forecasting. The production forecast is created using the *Component* type. The forecast type *Both* is only used to give the planner an overview of both the sales forecast and the production forecast. With this option, the forecast entries are not editable. By designating these forecast types here, you can use the same worksheet to enter a sales forecast as you do a production forecast, and use the same sheet to view both forecasts simultaneously. Note that the system treats the different inputs (sales and production) differently when calculating planning, based on item, manufacturing, and production setup.  

## Component forecast

The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item. This can, for example, be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component.  

Because the component forecast is designed to define options for a parent item, the component forecast should be less than or equal to the sales item forecast quantity. If the component forecast is higher than the sales item forecast, the system treats the difference between these two types of forecasts as independent demand.  

## Forecasting periods

The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts. The time interval page gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period. It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period.  

## Forecast by locations

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page you can specify whether you want to consider the locations that are defined on forecasts when you calculate plans. 

### Use forecast by locations

If you turn on the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respects any location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and calculate the remaining forecast for each location.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you have configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system will suggest that you do the following:

- Replenish 10 pieces for location EAST, based on data from the forecast.  
- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order. The four pieces that were specified in the forecast are fully consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. For more information, see [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation, the overall forecast might not be representative.

### If you don't use forecast by locations

If you turn off the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and aggregate the forecasts into a forecast for empty locations.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system suggests that you do the following:

- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order.  
- Replenish 2 pieces for the empty location. The 10 and 4 pieces that were specified in the forecast are partially consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignored the location codes that were specified by the user and uses a blank location instead.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set a filter by locations, but location-based results might not match planning results without filters.

## To create a demand forecast

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Demand Forecast**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select a forecast in the **Demand Forecast Name** field. Multiple forecasts can exist and are differentiated by name and forecast type.  
3. In the **Location Filter** field, select the location to which this forecast will apply.
4. In the **View by** field to change the period that is displayed in each column. You can select from the following intervals: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, **Quarter**, **Year**, or the **Accounting Period** as set up in your finance area.

> [!NOTE]  
> You should consider which time interval that you want to use for future forecasts so that the time interval is consistent throughout. When you enter a forecast quantity, it is valid on the first day of the time interval that you select. For example, if you select a month, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the month. If you select a quarter, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the first month in the quarter.

5. In the **View as** field, select how the forecast quantities are shown for the time interval. If you select **Net Change**, then the net change in balance is displayed for the time interval. If you select **Balance at Date**, then the page displays the balance as of the last day in the time interval.  
6. In the **Forecast Type** field, select **Sales Item**,  **Component**, or **Both**. If you select **Sales Item** or **Component**, then you can edit the quantity by period. If you select **Both**, then you cannot edit the quantity, but you can choose the drop-down arrow button and view the demand forecast entries.  
7. Specify a **Date Filter** if you want to limit the amount of data displayed.  
8. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** FastTab, enter the forecasted quantities by typing a quantity in the cell representing an item on a particular date or period. Note that in empty cells, the lookup button opens an empty page indicating that you must enter a value manually.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also edit an existing forecast. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** page, choose the **Copy Demand Forecast** action and populate the **Demand Forecast** page with an existing forecast. You can then edit quantities as appropriate.

# Connect to Power BI from Business Central on-premises

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must be enabled for Power BI integration. This task is typically done by an administrator. For more information about enabling Power BI integration with Business Central online, see [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](admin-powerbi-setup.md).

Some features are only available with Business Central online, not on-premises. Learn more in [Introduction to Business Central and Power BI](admin-powerbi.md#get-ready-to-use-power-bi)

## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication.

1. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

   Enable OData web service on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] and open the OData port in the firewall. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

   The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

1. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

   A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. Learn more in [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

1. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

   To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, register an application for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. Learn more in [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

1. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

   Before users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator must give consent to the Power BI service.

   To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action leads you through the consent process and checks your Power BI license. When you're prompted, sign in using a Microsoft Entra admin account. Learn more in [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).

## Build Power BI reports displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your Dynamics 365 Business Central data available as a data source in Power BI Desktop and build powerful reports of the state of your business.

Use Power BI Desktop to create reports that display Dynamics 365 Business Central data. After creating reports, you can publish them to your Power BI service or share them with all users in your organization. Once these reports are in the Power BI service, users set up for it can view the reports in  Business Central.

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multitenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A user name and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you need a user name and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization might have specific account for this purpose.

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.
1. Sign-in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

   If you're not signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from Power BI desktop before, you're prompted to sign in.

   For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and select **OK**. When prompted, enter the user name and password for the account for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. Select **Connect** when done.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you aren't prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

1. Once connected, Power BI contacts the Business Central service. The **Navigator** windows appears and displays available data sources for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and see the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all the web services and API pages published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The data sources are grouped by Business Central environments and companies.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.

1. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
1. To add more Business Central data later, repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, view it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and can begin building your Power BI report.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about Power BI Desktop in [Get started with Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-getting-started).

## Manage and modify reports

> [!NOTE]
> You can't manage and modify reports.

## Upload reports

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, there are no demo reports available, so you have to start from scratch by using Power BI Desktop. Alternatively, Power BI reports can be distributed as files that you can upload directly from Power BI online service. Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

# Power BI Sales app semantic model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The semantic model in the Power BI Sales app is organized in a [Star Schema Model](/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview).

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices, and posted credit memos from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The dimension tables provide more context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.

## Fact tables

Fact tables store transactional data and support summarizations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and more. There are three fact tables in the Power BI Sales app:

- [Opportunity Entries](#opportunity-entries)
- [Sales](#sales)
- [Sales Budget](#sales-budget)

### Opportunity entries

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away, a movement, or a warehouse put-away to put away the output.  

## Put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post output for a production or assembly order in advanced warehouse configurations, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the number of the source document, such as the production order number, in internal put-away or movement documents for assembly or production output.  

You can also use warehouse put-aways for production outputs, which means you can use the same warehouse process for production outputs as you use for other receipts. Using the same process makes things easier because you don't have to switch between different types of document. Also, it's especially valuable for advanced configurations where Directed Put-Away and Pick is enabled because inventory put-away documents aren't available.

To use warehouse put-aways, on the **Location Card** page, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, choose **Warehouse Put-away**.

> [!NOTE]
> For locations where Directed Put-away and Pick is enabled, make the field editable and allow the selection of **No warehouse handling** or **Warehouse put-away**. You can't select the **Inventory Put-away** option.
>
> You can't activate warehouse put-away if there are released production orders for the selected location.

When you post production output for a location where the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field is set to **Warehouse Put-away** on the **Location Card** page, the warehouse put-away document is either created automatically or you must use the **Warehouse Put-Away Worksheet** page.

If you delete a warehouse put-away, you can manually create a new one using the **Create warehouse put-away** action on the **Release Production Order** or **Finished Prod Order** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have production order lines with different locations with **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** set to **Warehouse Put-away**. To resolve this issue, use different production orders.
>
> You can't cancel output if there are outstanding or completed put-aways.

# Searching the web with Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Some Copilot features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can search the web for additional information. Allowing Copilot to search the web improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from public website content, and saves you time from having to switch apps to manually find things yourself. Copilot is powered by Microsoft Bing, and connecting Copilot to Bing search is optional. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bing Search is available from update 26.3, initially in Sandbox environments only. Because it's intended for use with AI features, Bing Search isn't available for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Bing Search? 

Microsoft Bing is an online service operated by Microsoft that allows apps to search the web and return web results, similar to when you open up your browser and search the web with Microsoft Bing or with other search engines. Microsoft Bing Search enables safe, ad-free search results, surfacing relevant information from billions of websites. 

Microsoft Bing is a separate product that operates differently from Dynamics 365 and has different data-handling practices covered by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://aka.ms/msa) between each user and Microsoft, together with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). Microsoft acts as an independent data controller responsible for complying with all applicable laws and controller obligations.

## Which Copilot features can search the web? 

The following table describes the list of Copilot capabilities that currently use Bing Search. 

| Feature | How Bing Search is used | What happens if Bing Search isn't enabled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot Chat | **From Update 26.3**<br> Copilot uses Bing Search to read publicly-available documentation that matches the add-on apps that you have installed to your environment, providing more accurate answers that are tailored to how your organization uses Business Central. This documentation is owned and hosted by the third-party publisher of each app. <br><br> **Example:** <br>You install an add-on to manage customer loyalty schemes that includes a new Customer Tier field added to the customer card. Copilot will now be able to explain how this field works, or why you get an error when setting this field.| You can continue to chat with Copilot, but responses will be of lower quality.<br><br> Copilot will respond only based on content from Microsoft’s documentation that has no information about how you have customized Business Central. Learn more in [Chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md). |

## How does Bing Search work? 

The Bing Search service is hosted in the United States geographic region. When Copilot connects to this service, the web search query (input) and search results (output) are temporarily processed by this service. If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is hosted outside of the United States, this input and output moves outside of your environment’s geographic region or compliance boundary, but isn't stored there for more than 1 day. 

## How much does it cost to search the web?

At this time, Copilot features that search the web are included in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license at no additional cost. You don't incur any one-time or operating charges whenever these features search the web. 

## How can administrators enable Bing Search? 

From the **Copilot and agent capabilities** page, activate the switch **Enable Bing Search**. This setting affects the experience for all users of that environment, and takes effect when you or other users next sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Is it safe to enable Bing Search? 

Yes. Microsoft is committed to ensuring that Copilot is built for enterprise use with the security, privacy, compliance, and responsible AI controls that our customers expect.  

By enabling Bing Search in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]: 

- Minimal data is sent to Bing Search. This typically includes a few search terms, usually extracted from user prompts or generated by Copilot depending on the task that requires searching the web. Web search queries may include customer data or personal data. 
- Search results from Bing Search undergo various checks for safety, including malicious site detection and content filtering. 
- Web search queries aren't shared with advertisers and aren’t used to train our foundation Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- Copilot doesn’t search the web unconditionally. Searching the web is done selectively, whenever Copilot has no alternative to compute accurate results based on data within [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from the Azure OpenAI Service foundation models. 
- Copilot can make outgoing connects to search the web, but it doesn't open up Copilot up for being accessed by any other website, app, or service on the internet. All calls are outgoing only. Copilot remains entirely operated by end-users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the security, privacy, and compliance controls for your organization.

# Manage AppSource apps
 
From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can discover, view, sort, and filter available AppSource apps that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

On the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page, you can filter available AppSource apps by name, publisher name, install state, popularity, average rating, number of ratings, and last modified date. You can also select a given app and see the details for that specific app.

To locate the page, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft AppSource Apps**, and then choose the related link.

On the page, you find the following actions:

- **View AppSource** to open the online AppSource marketplace in a new browser window. 
- **View in AppSource** to open and view a selected app in the online AppSource Marketplace. 
- **Refresh list from Microsoft AppSource** to force a refresh of the list of all apps to AppSource marketplace content—for example, if you're looking for a newly submitted AppSource app.

As with other list pages, you get support for Analysis Mode, for example, so that you can group apps by publisher. Use Copilot to design an **Analysis Mode** view for you.

## Install and update AppSource apps

Install AppSource apps using the **Extension Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central online using apps](ui-extensions.md).  

Upgrade AppSource apps using the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center. Learn more in [Managing Apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-apps).

# Define document layouts for customers and vendors

Document layouts use report layouts to define the look and feel of documents that you send to customers and vendors. Business Central provides standard layouts, but you can also tailor custom layouts for each of your business partners. Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md). You select standard and custom document layouts from customer and vendor cards by choosing the **Document Layouts** action. The value in the **Usage** field defines the process for which the document layout is used. For example, for customers, you might use **Reminder**, **Shipment**, and **Confirmation** types of document layouts.

Document layouts can also save you time when you send documents to customer or vendor contacts by email. For each layout that you assign to the customer or contact, you can by specify one or more contact email addresses. For example, you can send an invoice to the customer's purchasing and warehouse contacts. Adding contact email addresses is easy. On the **Document Layouts** page, the **Select Email from Contacts** action let's you choose from a list of the contact email addresses that you registered for the customer or vendor. You can also add email addresses manually. If you enter multiple addresses, separate them with a semi-colon, and don't add spaces between the addresses.

Before you define which document layout to use for which processes, and which contact to send the document to, load all the available reports (documents) from the **Report Selections** page. You can quickly load the documents by using the **Copy from Report Selection** action on the **Document Layouts** page.

The steps in the following sections describe how to define sales document layouts from the **Customer Card** page. For vendors, the steps are the same from the **Vendor Card** page.

## Load the standard document layouts for sales documents for a customer

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then choose the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, choose the **Copy from Report Selection** action.

The **Document Layouts** page displays all layouts that are available for sales documents.

## Select a report layout to use for the sales document layout

The following steps assume that layout you want for the type of document is already created. Learn more about creating layouts in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then select the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for document layout that you want to use a report layout for, set the **Email Body Layout** and **Email Attachment Layout** fields. You can choose different layouts for each.

   >![!NOTE]
   > If you want to use a legacy custom report layout, set the layout in the **Custom Layout Description** field. By default, the **Custom Layout Description** field is hidden. If the field isn't available, you can personalize the page to add it. To personalize the page, select the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="The Settings icon."::: icon, and then select **Personalize**. Learn more about legacy custom report layouts in [(Legacy) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md)

## Specify which contact receives which document layout for a customer

To save time when you send documents to customer and vendor contacts by email, specify their email addresses on document layouts. For example, you can always send customer statements to their accountant contacts and sales orders to their purchasers, or purchase orders to vendor salespeople.

1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for a report layout that you want to send to a specific contact for the customer, select the **Select Email from Contacts** action.
1. On the **Contacts** page, select one or more contacts, and then select **OK**.

# Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in Power BI. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the metrics you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. Add alerting, if needed, to define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step automates status updates based on rules that govern the metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules versatile. For connected metrics, these status rules refresh every time the data in your scorecard refreshes.
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Make payments with the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension or SEPA credit transfer

On the **Payment Journals** page, you can process payments to your vendors by exporting a file together with the payment information from the journal lines. You can then upload the file to your electronic bank where the related money transfers are processed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

 To enable SEPA credit transfers, you must first set up a bank account, a vendor, and the general journal batch that the payment journal is based on. You then prepare payments to vendors by automatically filling the **Payment Journals** page with due payments with specified posting dates.  

After you verify that the bank processed the payments, you can post the payment journal lines.  

## Setting up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension

Activate the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to:

* Convert bank statement files to a format that you can import.
* Convert your exported payment files to the format that your bank requires.

For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

## Setting up SEPA credit transfer

From the **Payment Journals** page, you can export payments to a file for upload to your electronic bank for processing of the related money transfers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.  

To be able export of a bank file format that isn't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process payment electronically by exporting payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the bank account in question to handle the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up vendor cards to process payments by exporting files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up the related general journal batch to enable payment export from the **Payment Journals** page  
* Connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods  

> [!NOTE]
> Business Central supports both SEPA format CT pain.001.001.03 and CT pain.001.001.09. You can choose any format on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

> [!TIP]
> This article applies to the generic version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In your country or region, additional required fields may have been added to the various pages. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must fill in the **Country/Region Code** field. If the field is blank, you can't export payments for the account. Also, the country/region must have a valid ISO Code.

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Currency Code** field, specify the currency for the bank account.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The **Currency Code** field must be set to **EUR**, because SEPA credit transfers can only be made in the EURO currency.  

6. On the **Transfer** FastTab, in the **Payment Export Format** field, choose the SEPA format you want to use.  
7. In the **IBAN** field, specify the international bank account number for the account.  

### To set up a vendor card for SEPA Credit Transfer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card of the vendor you pay electronically using export payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format.  
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Payment Method Code** field, choose **BANK**.  
4. In the **Preferred Bank Account** field, choose the bank to which the money transfers when it's processed by your electronic bank.  

    If you don't have a bank account set up for this vendor, you can do so now. For more information, see [To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md#to-set-up-vendor-bank-accounts-for-export-of-bank-files). The value in the **Preferred Bank Account** field is copied to the **Recipient Bank Account** field on the **Payment Journal** page.  

### To set the payment journal up to export payment files

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose the drop\-down button.  
3. On the **General Journal Batches** page, choose the **Edit List** action.  
4. On the line for the payment journal that you use to export payments, select the **Allow Payment Export** checkbox.  

### To connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Methods** page, select the payment method that is used to export payments from, and then choose the **Pmt. Export Line Definition** field.

## Preparing the payment journal

Fill the payment journal with lines for due payments to vendors, with the option to insert posting dates based on the due date of the related purchase documents. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## Exporting payments to a bank file

When you're ready to make payments to your vendors, or reimbursements to your employees, you can export a file with the payment information on the lines on the **Payment Journals** page. You can then upload the file to your bank to process the related money transfers.

In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension is available. In North American versions, the same extension can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can export payment files from the payment journal, you must specify the electronic format for the involved bank account, and you must enable the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md) and [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md). In addition, you must select the **Allow Payment Export** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

Use the **Credit Transfer Registers** page to view the payment files that exported from the payment journal. From this page, you can also re-export payment files if there were technical errors or file changes. Note, however, that exported EFT files aren't shown in this page and can't be re-exported.  

### To export payments to a bank file

The following steps describe how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. For more information, see [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using EFT, you must select either **Electronic Payment** or **Electronic Payment–IAT** in the **Bank Payment Type** field. Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** and **Vendor Bank Account Card** pages. You will be informed about wrong or missing setup values as you try to export the file.
    >
    > The EFT feature can only be used for bank accounts in the local currency. It cannot be used with a foreign currency, indicated by a value in the **Currency Code** field. (Blank field value means local currency.)

3. After you fill in all payment journal lines, choose the **Export** action.
4. On the **Export Electronic Payments** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    Error messages show in the **Payment File Errors** FactBox, where you can also choose an error message to access more details. You must resolve all errors before you can export the payment file.

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, a common error message states that the bank account number does not have the length that your bank requires. To avoid or resolve the error, you must remove the value in the **IBAN** field on the **Bank Account Card** page and then, in the **Bank Account No.** field, enter a bank account number in the format that your bank requires.

5. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you are using EFT, save the resulting vendor remittance form as a Word document or select to have it emailed directly to the vendor. The payments are now added to the **Generate EFT File** page from where you can generate multiple payment orders together to save transmission cost. For more information, see the following steps.
6. On the **Payment Journals** page, choose the **Generate EFT File** action.

    On the **Generate EFT File** page, the **Lines** FastTab shows all EFT payments that you exported from the payment journal for a bank account but aren't yet generated.
7. Choose the **Generate EFT File** action to export one file for all the EFT payments.
8. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

The bank payment file is exported to the location you specified. You can upload it to your electronic bank account and make the actual payments. Then you can post the exported payment journal lines.

### To plan when to post exported payments

If you don't want to post a payment journal line for an exported payment, you can just delete the journal line. For example, because you're waiting for confirmation that the bank processed the transaction. Later, when you create a payment journal line to pay the remaining amount, the **Total Exported Amount** field shows how much of the payment amount was already exported. Also, you can find detailed information about the exported total by choosing the **Credit Transfer Reg. Entries** button to see details about exported payment files.

If you don't want to post payments until the bank confirms they're processed, you can:

* In a payment journal with suggested payment lines, you can sort on either the **Exported to Payment File** column or the **Total Exported Amount** and then delete payment suggestions for open invoices for which payments were already made.
* On the **Suggest Vendor Payments** page, where you specify which payments to insert in the payment journal, you can select the **Skip Exported Payments** checkbox if you don't want to insert journal lines for payments that were already exported.

To see information about exported payments, choose the **Payment Export History** action.

### To re-export payments to a bank file

You can re-export payment files from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Before you delete or post payment journal lines, you can also re-export the payment file from the **Payment Journals** page by exporting it again. If you delete or post the payment journal lines after your export, you can re-export the same payment file from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Select the line for the batch of credit transfers that you want to re-export, and then use the **Reexport Payments to File** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> Exported EFT files are not shown on the **Credit Transfer Registers** page and cannot be re-exported.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Credit Transfer Registers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a payment export that you want to re-export, and then choose the **Reexport Payment to File** action.

## Posting the payments

After your bank processes the electronic payment, post the payments. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

# Walkthrough conducting a sales campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This increases the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers (contacts) in a follow-up campaign.  

 The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales & Marketing department. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Preparing the data.
- Setting up a campaign.  
- Selecting the target audience.  
- Mining data.  
- Sending letters to contacts.  
- Registering campaign responses.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager  
- Marketing Staffer  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. The marketing manager also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting up a campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the target audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use various criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too large. The manager decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to focus on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a segment to a campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending letters and email messages to contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

> [!NOTE]  
> If needed click on the **Edit Pencil** icon to open the page in edit mode.

1. Open the **Segment** card for the **Visitors at the FUTURUS trade show**.  
2. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template code **BUS** and select **Yes**.
3. Choose the **Language Code (Default)** field to open the **Segment Interaction Languages** page. Select a **Language Code** and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Make sure that the **Correspondence Type (Default)** is set to **Hard Copy**.
5. In the **Attachment** field, select the **Ellipsis** box. This opens the Import Attachment dialog.
    1. Select the **Choose** button to choose your file.
    1. Find the file and select the **Open** button to attach it.
6. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**. Select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to leave the field, and select the **Yes** button.
7. Slide the **Send Word Docs as Attmt** to on and select the **Yes** button.
8. Choose the action **Log**. In the Log Segment pop-up window enable:
 **Create Follow-up Segment**
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the **Log Segment batch job**.  

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.  

Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Interaction Log Entries**, and then choose the related link. There's an entry for each sent letter.  

### To send an email message to a contact  

1. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template, code **BUS**.  
2. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**.  
3. In the **Correspondence Type** field, choose **E-Mail**.  
4. Specify language settings, and attach a Word document, as in the previous procedure.  
5. Choose the **Log** action. The **Log Segment** page opens.  
6. Select the **Send Attachments** check box to have the attachments sent by email.  
7. Select the **Create Follow-up Segment** check box.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

 The letters are automatically sent by email, and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is saved in the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Register campaign responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and records these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.  

 There's no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns. Therefore, create a new template.  

2. On the **Interaction Templates** dropdown, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter **RESP**, and in the **Description** field, enter **Campaign Responses**.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to apply this interaction template code to all segment lines.
6. On the **Campaign** FastTab, select the **Campaign Response** field. Choose **Yes** to confirm the message *You have modified Campaign Response*.  
7. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Log** action.  
8. On the **Log Segment** page, clear the **Send Attachments** check box. Then choose the **OK** button to confirm the message that the segment has been logged.

# Multiple VAT registration numbers 

For businesses with warehouses in multiple EU countries, managing VAT (Value Added Tax) can be challenging, as each warehouse location requires a different VAT number to comply with the specific regulations of each country. This article provides information about this requirement and explains the functionality for multiple value-added tax (VAT) registration numbers. This functionality allows users to set up tax registration numbers for their customers in different countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]
> The *Multiple VAT numbers for customers* functionality is available only from Business Central 2024 release wave 2 (version 25).

## How to set up the alternative VAT registration numbers  

To set up the alternative VAT registration numbers for different countries/regions, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, and then select the related link. 
2. Add the customer in the **Customer No** field and the country/region related to this VAT registration in the **VAT Country/Region Code**.  
3. You must add the VAT number in the **VAT Registration No.** field. You must stick to the format when you use **Country/Region Code**. 
4. If you want to use different VAT or general posting groups, you can alternatively add them to the setup in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields. 
5. Close the page.   

To create an alternative address for your customer, follow these steps:  

1. Open the **Customer** card for the customer you want to add new **Ship-to Address**. 
2. Select **Customer**, and choose the **Ship-to Addresses** action.   
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page opens, and select **New**. 
4. Fill in the information about your customer's ship-to destination.  
5. Choose the proper **Country/Region Code**.   
6. If you have already configured a new **VAT Registration No.** on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, nothing will happen. 
  - But if you didn't configure the **VAT Registration No.** previously on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, the following notification appears: **Click Add if you want to insert the Alternative VAT Registration for this Ship-To Country Code.**
  - Choose the **Add** action on the notification and the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page opens.
This page populates your **Customer No.** and the **VAT Country/Region Code**. So, you just need to add the setup that you want to use. 

## Work with the sales documents   

You can create new [sales invoice](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [sales order](sales-how-sell-products.md) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to use a ship-to address that differs from the customer's address and is located in a different country, follow the steps:  

### Alternate shipping address  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option. 
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page with available alternate addresses appears. 
4. Choose one of the addresses with a different **Country/Region Code**. 
5. The **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that you have modified because of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup change. 
6. Select **OK** to confirm.   

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to confirm such a choice anymore, you can select the **Don't show again** field, and in the future you won't see this type of notification about changes. But if you want to enable it again, you can do it by enabling the **Confirm Alternative VAT Registration** field on the **VAT Setup**.  
   
7. Once you confirm, the values are overwritten with the values from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You can check all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  
8. Post the document.  

### Custom address  

In case you don't have the ship-to address configured but still want to use a different address for shipping, you can use this option.  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Custom Address** option.  
3. Change the country in the **Country/Region** field.  
4. Once you change the country/region code to match the **VAT Country/Region Code** of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that have been changed. 
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will also change all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  

### Work with no shipment 

If there's no shipment as a process, you still can leverage the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup.

In the sales order or invoice, you can find the **VAT Country/Region Code** under the **Invoice Details** FastTab and specify the value that matches the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You should see the same confirmation dialog page as above. 

In this situation, you can post a sales invoice with the proper **VAT Registration No.** for your customer even if you don't ship items with this document. 

### Work with the sales credit memo  

Once you post the invoice with a **Ship-to address** or **VAT Country/Region Code** that has different posting data, the corrective **Sales credit memo** takes the values from the **Posted sales invoice** header where these values are taken from the **Alternative customer VAT registration**, so no other actions required.

# Purchases By Purchaser (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Purchaser** report provides a detailed overview of purchasing activities for each purchaser. The report lets you analyze the item categories and items that each purchaser buys most frequently, and how much they spent.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-purchaser.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Purchaser Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-purchaser.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can easily identify top purchasers and track their purchasing trends over time using the **Purchases by Vendor** report. This information can help you make informed decisions about future purchasing activities and optimize purchasing strategies.

Purchaser can use this report to monitor purchasing activities, including purchase amounts and quantities. This report also shows the items you bought the most and how they contribute to overall spending. This information can help you make good decisions about future purchases.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Purchaser* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-quantity)

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

# Walkthrough: Set up and use a purchase approval workflow

You can automate the process of approving new or changed records, such as documents, journal lines, and customer cards, by creating workflows with steps for the approvals in question.

Before you create approval workflows, you must set up an approver and substitute approver for each approval user. To define which sales and purchase records they're qualified to approve, you can also set amount limits for approvers. Approval requests and other notifications can be sent as emails or internal notes. For each approval user setup, you can also set up when they receive notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the workflow functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use Power Automate to define workflows for events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Note that although they're two separate workflow systems, any flow template that you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Use Business Central in an Automated Workflow](across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow.md).  

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough is a scenario illustrating the following tasks:  

- Setting up approval users  
- Setting up notifications for approval users  
- Modifying and enabling an approval workflow  
- Requesting approval of a purchase order (as Alicia)  
- Receiving a notification and then approving the request (as Sean)  

## Story

Sean is a super user at CRONUS and creates two approval users. One is Alicia who represents a purchasing agent. The other is Sean themself, representing Alicia's approver. Sean then gives themself unlimited purchase approval rights and specifies that they'll receive notifications by internal note as soon as a relevant event occurs. Finally, Sean creates the required approval workflow as a copy of the existing *Purchase Order Approval Workflow* template, leaves all existing event conditions and response options unchanged, and then enables the workflow.  

To test the approval workflow, Sean signs in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as Alicia and then requests approval of a purchase order. Sean then signs in as themself, finds the note in the Role Center, follows the link to the approval request for the purchase order, and approves the request.  

## Users

Before you can set up approval users and their notification method, you must make sure that those users exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]: One user will represent Alicia. The other user, yourself, will represent Sean. Learn more at [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

### Set up approval users

When signed in as yourself, set up Alicia as an approval user whose approver is yourself. Set up your approval rights and specify how and when you're notified of approval requests.  

#### To set up yourself and Alicia as approval users

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Approval User Setup** page, choose the **New** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must set up an approver before you can set up users who require that approver's approval. That means you must set yourself up before you can set Alicia up.  

3. Set up the two approval users by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |User ID|Approver ID|Unlimited Purchase Approval|  
    |-------|-----------|---------------------------|  
    |YOU||Selected|
    |ALICIA|YOU||

### Set up notifications

In this walkthrough, the user is notified by an internal note about requests to approve. Approval notifications can also be sent by email, and you can add a workflow response step that notifies the sender when a request is approved or rejected. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md).

#### To set up how and when you're notified

1. On the **Approval User Setup** page, select the line for yourself, and then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
2. On the **Notification Setup** page, in the **Notification Type** field, choose **Approval**.  
3. In the **Notification Method** field, choose **Note**.  
4. On the **Notification Setup** page, choose the **Notification Schedule** action.  
5. On the **Notification Schedule** page, in the **Recurrence** field, select **Instantly**.  

## Create the approval workflow

Create the purchase order approval workflow by copying the steps from the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow** template. Leave the existing workflow steps unchanged, and then enable the workflow.  

> [!TIP]
> Optionally, add a workflow response step to notify the sender when their request is approved or rejected. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md).

### To create and enable a purchase order approval workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, select **Actions**, then select **New**, and then choose the **New Workflow from Template** action.  
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, select the workflow template named **Purchase Order Approval Workflow**.  

   The **Workflow** page opens for a new workflow containing all the information of the selected template. The value in the **Code** field is extended with *-01* to indicate this is the first workflow created from the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow** template.  
4. On the header of the **Workflow** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.  

## Use the approval workflow

Use the new Purchase Order Approval Workflow by first signing in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as Alicia to request approval of a purchase order. Then sign in as yourself, view the note on the Role Center, follow the link to the approval request, then approve the request.  

### To request approval of a purchase order, as Alicia

1. Sign in as Alicia.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.  
3. Select the line to open *Purchase Order 106001*.  
4. On the **Purchase Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Request Approval**, and then choose the **Send Approval Request** action.  

Notice that the value in the **Status** field has changed to **Pending Approval**.  

### To approve the purchase order, as Sean

1. Sign in as Sean.
2. On the Role Center, in the **Self Service** area, choose **Requests to Approve**.
3. On the **Requests to Approve** page, select the line about the purchase order from Alicia, then choose the **Approve** action.  

The value in the **Status** field on Alicia's purchase order changes to **Released**.  

You have now set up and tested a simple approval workflow based on the first two steps of the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow**. You can easily extend this workflow to automatically post Alicia's purchase order when Sean approves it. To do this, you must enable the **Purchase Invoice Workflow**, so the response to a released purchase invoice is to post it. First you must change the event condition on the first workflow step from (purchase) **Invoice** to **Order**.  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many workflow templates for scenarios that are supported by the application code. Most of these templates are for approval workflows.  

You define variations of workflows by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

# Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automated workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to recurring problems.

## Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

### Possible cause

Currently, there's a limit on how many records a flow can process. If more than 1000 records are created or changed within 30 seconds, the flow isn't triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. Learn more at [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions#notes-for-power-automate-flows) in the Developer and Admin help.

## "The response from the Business Central service is too large" error

### Problem

When using an action that interacts with records (such as *Create record (V3)* and *Get record (V3)*), Power Automate might display an error similar to this one:

`The response from the Business Central service is too large`

### Possible cause

Even though Business Central has no set limit on the size of records returned by APIs, the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector for Power Automate can handle only records up to 8 MB.

All the Business Central APIs provided by Microsoft return records under this limit, but APIs provided by partners might not. If you see an error "The response from the Business Central service is too large," reach out to the partner who created the API you're using.

## "Entity set not found" error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to this one:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate for approvals requires certain page and codeunit objects to be published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services. But in some cases, your environment might have been customized so these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

| Object Type | Object ID | Object Name | Service Name |
|--|--|--|--|
| Codeunit | 1544 | WorkflowWebhookSubscription | WorkflowActionResponse |
| Page | 6408 | workflowCustomers | workflowCustomers |
| Page | 6406 | workflowGenJournalBatches | workflowGenJournalBatches |

| Page | 6402 | workflowSalesDocuments | workflowSalesDocuments |
| Page | 6410 | workflowVendors | workflowVendors |
| Page | 831 | workflowWebhookSubscriptions | workflowWebhookSubscriptions |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.

# Financial Reporting frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Financial Reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## New report, row, or column definitions aren't available after an upgrade. How do I get access to them?

Financial report, row, and column definitions are stored as data in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. To make sure your definitions aren't overwritten or changed during upgrade, new definitions are only available in new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants.

To make new report, row, or column definitions available in existing companies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new tenant.
1. Export the definitions you would like as configuration packages.
1. Sign in to your tenant, and switch to the company where you want the new definitions.
1. Import the configuration packages with the new definitions.

To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).

## Why don't the numbers in my report balance with the general ledger?

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance with the general ledger. To learn more about possible reasons and ways to fix these issues, go to [Balancing reports to the general ledger](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger).

## How can I test my report?

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. To learn more, go to [Adding check figures](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#adding-check-figures).

## When should I use net change vs. balance at date?

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports. To learn more, go to [When to use net change or balance at date](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-net-change-or-balance-at-date).

## Which users can run or modify financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Permissions to view or edit financial reports](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#permissions-to-view-or-edit-financial-reports).

## How can I setup auditing on changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#set-up-the-change-log-for-financial-report-definitions).

## How can I get notified when financial report definitions change?

To learn more, go to [Get notified when financial report definitions change](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#get-notified-when-financial-report-definitions-change).

## How can I analyze changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-financial-report-definitions).

# Set Up Resource Allocation
To ensure that a service task is performed well, it's important to find a resource who is qualified to do the work. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that it's easy to allocate someone who has the right skills for the job. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], we call this _resource allocation_. You can allocate resources based on their skill, availability, or whether they are in the same service zone as the customer. 

To use resource allocation, you must set up:  
  
* The skills required to repair and maintain service items. You assign these to service items and resources.  
* Geographic regions, called zones, that you define for your market. For example, East, West, Central, and so on. You assign these to customers and resources.  
* Whether to display resource skills and zones, and whether to display a warning if someone chooses unqualified resource, or a resource that is not in the customer zone.  

## To set up skills
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Skills**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign skills to service items and resources
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For service items, choose **Resource Skills**.  
    * For resources, choose **Skills**.  

## To set up zones
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign zones to customers and resources 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For customers, choose a zone in the **Service Zone Code** field.  
    * For resources, choose the **Service Zones** action.  

## To specify what to show when a resource is chosen
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Resource Skills Option** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  
  
    |**Option**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |Code Shown | Displays the code only.|  
    |Warning Displayed | Shows the information and displays a warning if you choose a resource that is not qualified.|  
    |Not Used | Does not show this information.|  

## To update resource capacity  
You may need to change the capacity of resources.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Capacity**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the resource, and then choose the **Set Capacity** action.  
3. Make the changes, and then choose **Update Capacity**.  

## To update skills for items, service items, or service item groups
If you want to change the skill codes assigned to items, for example from **PC** to **PCS**, you can do so either for an item, service item, or for all items in a service item group.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items** or **Service Item**, or **Service Item Group**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the entity to update, and then choose the **Resource Skills** action.  
3. On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, choose the relevant skill code.  
4.  If the item has associated service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    * Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related service items.  
    * Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this item only. The skill code on the related service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.

# Sales Demographics (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Sales Demographics** report provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across demographic segments. The report offers valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences that can help you optimize sales strategies.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-demographics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Demographics report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-demographics.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to to gain a deeper understanding of sales performance based on demographic factors. This report is helpful for analyzing sales metrics by item category, customer posting group, document type, and geographical location to identify trends and opportunities for growth.

As the CEO of a furniture company, you want to understand how demographic factors including item categories, posting groups or geographical regions impact sales performance.

By analyzing the report, you discover that domestic customers in urban areas account for 60% of your total sales. Also, the report uncovers that one region is underperforming compared to another, despite similar product offerings. Armed with this data, you decide to allocate more marketing budget and strategize a new promotional campaign to increase sales.

As a sales manager, you want to ensure that your team meets its revenue targets. You want to monitor sales performance across different customer segments and make data-driven adjustments to your sales strategy.

Using the report, you might find out that customers in the Corporate customer posting group are contributing significantly more to overall revenue than customers in Retail. Additionally, you might find that sales orders for ergonomic chairs are growing faster than leather office chairs. You use this information to direct your sales team to focus on up-selling ergonomic chairs to corporate clients.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The **Sales Demographics** report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

# Develop Business Central report layouts and datasets

Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a report object that defines their dataset and layouts. The dataset provides the data in the report, and the layouts control how the data is presented.  

## Developing report layouts

Want to modify the layout of a report? For Excel and Word layouts, you can do that yourself. If you want pixel-perfect RDLC layouts though, you might need help from a developer. 

The following table provides links to articles that describe options for customizing reports.

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# Sort, search, and filter data in lists, reports, or XMLports

A few mechanisms are available to help you scan, find, and limit the records in a list, a report, or an XMLport. They include operations like sorting, searching, and filtering. You can apply some or all of these operations simultaneously to quickly find or analyze your data.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For reports and XMLports, as for lists, you can set filters to delimit the data that is included. However, you can't sort or search.

> [!TIP]
> When you view your data as tiles, you can search and use filtering. However, the full set of powerful features for sorting, searching, and filtering is available only when you view the records as a list. To switch from the tile view to the list view, select the ![Show as list.](media/ui_show_as_list_icon.png "Show as list arrow left") button.

<!--
When you want to search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or product groups, you enter criteria. In search criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.
-->

## Sorting

Sorting makes it easy to get a quick overview of your data. For example, if you have many customers, you can sort them by **Customer No.**, **Currency Code**, or **Country Region Code** value to get the overview that you need.

To sort a list, follow one of these steps:

- Select the text of a column heading to switch between ascending and descending order.
- Select the dropdown arrow in the column heading, and then select either the **Ascending** action or the **Descending** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting isn't supported for images, binary large object (BLOB) fields, FlowFilters, and fields that don't belong to a table.

## Searching

At the top of each list page is a ![Search list.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** button that provides a quick and easy way to reduce the number of records in a list and show only those records that contain the data that you're interested in.

To search, select the **Search** button or the <kbd>F3</kbd> key on your keyboard. Then enter the text that you're looking for in the search field. The search text that you enter can include letters, numbers, and other symbols.

![Screenshot that shows the search field.](media/ui-search/search-list-box.png)

In general, search tries to match text across all fields. It doesn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters (in other words, it's case-insensitive). It also matches text that occurs anywhere in the field: at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

> [!NOTE]
> Search doesn't match values in images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, FlowFields, and other fields that aren't part of a table.

### Choose between modern search and legacy search

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

On the most common pages, such as **Customers**, **Contacts**, and **Items**, you can select the dropdown arrow in the search field and then select between two search options on the menu: **Use modern search** and **Use legacy search**.

![Screenshot that shows the Use modern search and Use legacy search options on the dropdown menu for a search field.](media/ui-search/search-modern-legacy-options.png)

*Legacy search* is the older search method. It's the only method that is available in Business Central 2024 release wave 1 and earlier. *Modern search* is a newer, faster, and more flexible search method. The key difference is that legacy search finds only records that contain the exact words that you enter, in the exact order that you enter them in, whereas modern search finds records that contain matching words in any order.

For example, the CRONUS demo company has an item that is named **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue**. If you enter `London chair` as the search text, legacy search doesn't return any results, because that exact text doesn't match any part of the item name. However, modern search finds the item by matching the words "London" and "chair" separately.

If you want to find all blue chairs in the CRONUS demo company, you might enter either `blue chair` or `chair blue` as the search text. In this case, modern search retrieves not only **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue** but also **TOKYO Guest Chair, blue**. However, once again, legacy search returns no results. To get results by using legacy search, you must enter `chair, blue` as the search text.

If you want to mimic the behavior of legacy search when you use modern search, you can enclose your search text in quotation marks, just as you can do in popular search engines. In this way, you refine the results by excluding any that aren't exact matches. For example, if you enter `"blue chair"` as the search text, modern search returns no results, because that exact text doesn't occur in any item name in the demo data.

Another difference is that modern search finds words that *start* with the letters you have entered. If you enter 'hair', it won't find the word 'chair'.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Modern search covers only columns that a developer designates for it. If you can't find existing data, try legacy search.
>
>   Learn more about how to designate columns for modern search in [Enable optimized text search on table fields](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-field-text-search).
>
> - The search indexes used for modern search are updated in the background, usually within a few seconds. But in some cases, recent data changes don't immediately show up in modern search results.
>
> - If the **Use modern search** option isn't available on the dropdown menu, one of the following factors might be the cause:
>
>   - Modern search isn't enabled for your environment. Administrators can enable the **Use optimized text search in lists** feature on the **Feature Management** page. Learn more in [Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time](admin-feature-management.md).
>   - The list doesn't include any columns that are designated for modern search.
>
> - If modern search is enabled for your environment, it's the default search method.

### Fine-tune the search by using filter criteria (legacy search only)

You can make a more exact search by using filter operators, expressions, and filter tokens. Unlike filtering, these criteria are applied across all fields when they're used in the search field. Therefore, they're less efficient than filtering.

- To find only field values that exactly match the entire search text, and the case of it, enclose the text in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, enter `'man'`.
- To find field values that start with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) after the text. For example, enter `man*`.
- To find field values that end with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) before the text. For example, enter `*man`.
- When you use single quotation marks (`''`) or asterisks (`*`), the search is case-sensitive. To make it case-insensitive, add an at sign (`@`) before the search text. For example, enter `@man*`.

The following table provides some examples to explain how you can use the search.

| Search criterion | Information that is found |
|---|---|
| `man` or `Man` | All records where the value of any field contains the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, **manual**, or **Sportsman**. |
| `'Man'` | All records where the value of any field contains only the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. |
| `Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, but not the value **manual** or **Sportsman**. |
| `@Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester** or **manual**, but not the value **Sportsman**. |
| `@*man` | All records where the value of any field ends with **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Sportsman**, but not the value **Manchester** or **manual**. |

## <a name="filtering"></a>Filtering

Filtering provides a more advanced and versatile way to control which records are included in a list, a report, or an XMLport. There are two major differences between searching and filtering, as the following table shows.

| | Searching | Filtering |
|---|---|---|
| **Applicable fields** | Search across all fields that are visible on the page. | Filter one or more fields individually. Select from any field in the table, including fields that aren't visible on the page. |
| **Matching** | Show records where field values match the search text, regardless of the text's case or placement in the field. | Show records where field values exactly match the filter, including the text's case, unless special filter symbols are entered.

By specifying filter criteria, you can show records for specific accounts or customers, dates, amounts, and other information. Only records that match the criteria are shown in the list or included in the report, batch job, or XMLport. If you specify criteria for multiple fields, only records that match all criteria are shown.

For lists, the filters are shown in a filter pane that appears to the left of the list when you activate it. For reports, batch jobs, and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page.

### Filter by using option fields

For "ordinary" fields that hold data, setup date, or business data, you can set filters both by selecting data and by entering filter values. You can also use symbols to define advanced filter criteria. Learn more in the [Enter filter criteria](#enter-filter-criteria) section.

However, for fields of the **Option** type, you can set a filter only by selecting one or more available options in a dropdown list. An example of an option field is the **Status** field on the **Sales Orders** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select multiple options as a filter value, the relationship between the options is defined as *OR*. For example, if you select both the **Open** checkbox and the **Released** checkbox in the **Status** filter field on the **Sales Orders** page, the page shows all sales orders that are either open or released.

### Set filters on lists

For lists, you set filters by using the filter pane. To show the filter pane for a list, select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the page, and then select the **Show filter pane** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

To show the filter pane for a column in a list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>. The filter pane appears, and the selected column is shown as a filter field in the **Filter list by** section.

The filter pane shows the current filters for a list. You can set your own custom filters on one or more fields by selecting the **+&nbsp;Filter** action.

The filter pane is divided into three sections: **Views**, **Filter list by**, and **Filter totals by**:

- **Views** – Some lists include the **Views** section. *Views* are variations of the list that are preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want for each list. The views are available to you on any device that you sign in to. Learn more in [Save and personalize list views](ui-views.md).
- **Filter list by** – This section is where you add filters on specific fields to reduce the number of records that are shown. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.
- **Filter totals by** – Some lists that show calculated fields, such as amounts and quantities, include the **Filter totals by** section. Here, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Filters in the **Filter totals by** section are controlled by FlowFilters in the page design. Learn about the technical aspects of FlowFilters in [FlowFilters overview](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-flowfilter-overview).

By using the filter pane, you can set a simple filter directly on a list to show only records that have the same value as a selected cell. Select a cell in the list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter to This Value** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

### Set filters in reports, batch jobs, and XMLports

For reports and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page. The request page shows the last-used filters according to your selection in the **Use default values from** field. Learn more in [Use default values—predefined settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

The main **Filter** section shows the default filter fields that you use to define which records should be included in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

In the **Filter totals by** section, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

## Enter filter criteria

Both in the filter pane and on a request page, you enter your filter criteria in the box under the filter field.

The type of the filter field determines which criteria you can enter. For example, to filter a field that has fixed values, you can select only among those values. Learn more about special filter symbols in the [Filter criteria and operators](#FilterCriteria) and [Filter tokens](#FilterTokens) sections.

Columns that already have filters are indicated by the ![Filter icon.](media/ui-search/filter-icon.png "Filter icon") symbol in the column heading. To remove a filter, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Clear Filter** action.

> [!TIP]
> By learning to use key combinations (keyboard shortcuts), you can find and analyze your data more quickly. For example, select a field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to add that field to the filter pane, enter the filter criteria, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the rows, select another field, and then select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to filter to that value. Learn more in [Search and filter lists](keyboard-shortcuts.md#KeyboardFilter).

### <a name="FilterCriteria"></a>Filter criteria and operators

When you enter criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the field. In addition, there's a set of special symbols that you can use as operators to further filter the results. The following sections describe these symbols and explain how to use them as operators in filters.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about how to filter dates and times in [Work with calendar dates and times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In some situations, the value that you want to filter on might contain a symbol that is an operator. Learn more about how to handle these situations in the [Filter on values that contain symbols](#symbols) section.
> - If a single filter includes more than 200 operators, the system automatically uses parentheses (`()`) to group some expressions for processing. This behavior has no effect on the filter or the results.

#### (..) Interval

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1100..2100` | Numbers 1100 through 2100 |
| `..2500` | Numbers up to and including 2500 |
| `..12 31 00` | Dates up to and including 12 31 00 |
| `Bicycle..Car` | Strings "Bicycle" through "Car" when they're ordered lexicographically |
| `P8..` | Information for accounting period 8 and later |
| `..23` | From the beginning date until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 |
| `23..` | From 23-current month-current year 0:00:00 until the end of time |
| `22..23` | From 22-current month-current year 0:00:00 until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 | 

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a numeric keypad, the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key might produce a character other than a period (.). To switch to a period, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key on the keyboard together with the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key on the numeric keypad. To switch back, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> again. Learn more in [Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).

> [!NOTE]
> If you filter on a field of the **Text** type, lexicographic ordering is used to determine what is included in the interval. If a field of the **Text** type is used to store integers, this behavior can lead to unexpected results. For example, a filter on `10000..10042` also includes the values **100000** and **1000042**.

#### (&verbar;) Either/or

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1200|1300` | Numbers with 1200 or 1300 |

#### (<>) Not equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<>0` | All numbers except 0 |

> [!TIP]
> The SQL Server option lets you combine `<>` with a wildcard expression. For example, `<>A*` means "not equal to any text that starts with *A*."

#### (>) Greater than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>1200` | Numbers greater than 1200 |

#### (>=) Greater than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>=1200` | Numbers greater than or equal to 1200 |

#### (<) Less than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<1200` | Numbers less than 1200 |

#### (<=) Less than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<=1200` | Numbers less than or equal to 1200 |

#### (&) And

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>200&<1200` | Numbers greater than 200 and less than 1200 |

#### ('') An exact character match

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `'man'` | Text that exactly matches **man** and is case-sensitive |
| `''` | Text that is empty |

#### (@) Case-insensitive

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `@man*` | Text that starts with **man** and is case-insensitive |

#### (*) An indefinite number of unknown characters

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `*Co*` | Text that contains **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `*Co` | Text that ends with **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `Co*` | Text that begins with **Co** and is case-sensitive |

#### (?) One unknown character

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `Hans?n` | Text such as **Hansen** or **Hanson** |

#### Combined format expressions

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `5999|8100..8490` | Any records that have the number 5999 or a number in the range from 8100 through 8490 |
| `..1299|1400..` | Records that have a number that is less than or equal to 1299, or a number that is greater than or equal to 1400 (that is, all numbers except 1300 through 1399) |
| `>50&<100 `| Records that have a number that is greater than 50 and less than 100 (that is, all numbers from 51 through 99) |

### <a name="symbols"></a>Filter on values that contain symbols

There might be cases where field values contain one of the following symbols:

- &
- (
- )
- =
- &verbar;

If you want to filter on any of these symbols, enclose the filter expression in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, to filter on records that start with the text **J & V**, the filter expression is `'J & V*'`.

This requirement applies only to the five symbols in the preceding list.

### <a name="FilterTokens"></a>Filter tokens

When you enter filter criteria, you can also enter *filter tokens*, which are words that have special meaning. After you enter a filter token, it's replaced by the value or values that it represents. Filter tokens make filtering easier, because you don't have to open other pages to look up values that you want to add to your filter. The following sections describe some of the tokens that you can enter as filter criteria.

> [!TIP]
> Your organization might use custom tokens. To learn about the complete set of tokens that is available to you, or to add more custom tokens, contact your administrator. Learn about the technical aspects of filter tokens in [Adding Custom Filter Tokens](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-adding-filter-tokens).

#### (%me or %user) Records assigned to you

When you filter fields that contain a user ID, such as the **Assigned to User ID** field, use the `%me` or `%user` filter token to show all records that are assigned to you.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%me` or `%user` | Records that are assigned to your user account |

#### (%mycustomers) Customers in My Customers

In the customer number (**No**) field, use the `%mycustomers` filter token to show all records for customers that are included in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%mycustomers` | Customers in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myitems) Items in My Items

In the item number (**No**) field, use the `%myitems` filter token to show all records for items that are included in the **My Items** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myitems` | Items in the **My Items** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myvendors) Vendors in My Vendors

In the vendor number (**No**) field, use the `%myvendors` filter token to show all records for vendors that are included in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myvendors` | Vendors in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center |

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

# Managing payables

A large part of managing accounts payable is paying your vendors, or reimbursing your employees for expenses. You can use functions to add payments lines for purchase invoices that are due on the **Payment Journal** page. To send transactions to your bank, you can export multiple payment journal lines to a file, and then upload the file to your bank. You can also make payments by check, including transmitting checks as electronic payments.

Another typical task is to apply outgoing payments to their related vendor or employee ledger entries in order to close purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, or employee accounts as paid. You apply outgoing payments to entries on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file to register the payments. The payments are applied to open vendor, customer, or employee ledger entries by matching payment text and entry information. There are various ways to review and change the matches before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

Alternatively, you can apply outgoing payments manually on the **Payment Journal** page or from the related vendor or employee ledger entries.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks within accounts payable, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.  

### To synchronize records of an integration table mapping  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** page, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPrem Notes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

# Walkthrough: Tracing Serial/Lot Numbers

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

When product defects occur, the errors must be identified and affected items must be prevented from leaving the company. If defective items have already been shipped, you must trace who received them and, if you need to, recall the items.  

The first task of defects management is to investigate where the defective items came from and where they were used. This investigation is based on historic data and is made easier by searching through item tracking entries using the **Item Tracing** page.  

The second task of defects management is to determine whether the traced items are planned for in open documents, such as non-posted sales orders or consumption journals. This work is performed on the **Find entries** page. You can use the Find Entries feature to search all kinds of database records.  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective, which vendor supplied them, and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled.  

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Tracing usage to origin.  
- Tracing origin to usage.  
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial/lot number.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Quality Controller  
- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.  
<!-- - To create new items and several business transactions by following the [Prepare Sample Data](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md#prepare-sample-data).   -->

## Story

Ricardo, the quality controller, is acting on a sales return of item 1002, Racing Bike. The customer, Selangorian Ltd., complained that the frame has cracked welding seams. Quality control engineers have confirmed that the racing frame of the returned bike is defective. The quality controller must now determine:  

- Which lot of racing frames was faulty.  
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received.  

From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, had the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they must determine where the finished racing bike was last used, and then they must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty component, the racing frame, came from.  

The results of this first item tracking task identify which racing frames were defective and which vendor supplied them. Afterward, but in the same overall tracking process, the quality controller must find all the sold racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those orders can be stopped or recalled. Lastly, the quality controller must find any open documents where the faulty lot is used so that no additional transactions are made.  

The first two defects-management tasks are performed on the **Item Tracing** page. The last task is performed on the **Find entries** page in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.  

## Prepare Sample Data

You must create the following new items:  

- 2000, Racing Frame: lot-specific tracking, component of 1002  
- 1002, Racing Bike: serial number-specific tracking  

Then you must create various purchase, production, and sales transactions with the two items.  

### To create the items  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter **2000**, and then proceed to fill in the following fields.  

    |Description|Base Unit of Measure|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|VAT Prod. Posting Group|Inventory Posting Group|Item Tracking Code|  
    |-----------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|  
    |Racing Frame|PCS|RAW MAT|VAT25|RAW MAT|LOTALL|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To enter the base unit of measure, choose the **New** button, and then select **PSC** on the **Item Units of Measure** page.  

4. All other fields have acceptable default data or do not have to be filled in.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to create the first new item card, 2000.  
6. Choose **New**.  
7. In the **No.** field, enter **1002**, and then proceed to fill in the following fields.  

    |Description|Base Unit of Measure|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|VAT Prod. Posting Group|Inventory Posting Group|Replenishment System|Item Tracking Code|  
    |-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|  
    |Racing Bike|PCS|RETAIL|VAT25|FINISHED|Prod. Order|SNALL|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To enter the base unit of measure, choose the **New** button, and then select **PSC** on the **Item Units of Measure** page.  

    Next, define the item's manufacturing setup.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames.  

    This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Find Entries features.  

## Tracing from Usage to Origin

 From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, has the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they can determine where the finished racing bike was last used, in this case, on the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd.. Then, the quality controller must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty racing frame came from and which vendor supplied it.  

### To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Item Tracing** page, enter **SN1** in the **Serial No. Filter** field, and then enter **1002** in the **Item Filter** field.  
3.  Keep the default setting of **Item-Tracked Only** in the **Show Components** field, and keep the default trace method of **Usage – Origin** in the **Trace Method**.  
4.  Choose the **Trace** action.  

    Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria. Before you continue the trace, verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd.  

5.  Select the trace line, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1.  
6.  Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from.  

    You can trace the following transaction history:  

    - The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order.  
    - The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order. Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used.  
    - The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory.  

    The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and they can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them, namely Custom Metals Incorporated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result, as you will use it in the next section.  

     This completes the first defects-management task using the **Item Tracing** page. The quality controller must now determine whether other posted documents have processed racing frames from LOT1.  

## Tracing from Origin to Usage

 The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1. They must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled.  

 One way to prepare this trace task on the **Item Tracing** page is to manually enter LOT1 in the **Lot No. Filter** field and 2000 in the **Item Filter** field. However, this walkthrough will use the **Trace Opposite - from Line** function.  

### To find all usage of the faulty lot  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the line of the purchase receipt, the last trace line, and then choose **Trace Opposite – from Line**.  

    The trace result is now based on the filters of the trace line for the purchase receipt, LOT1 and item 2000, and the result is based on trace method **Origin - Usage**.  

    To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1, continue to expand all trace lines.  

2.  Choose the **Expand All** action.  

    The first four trace lines refer to the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd., which is already resolved. The last line indicates that one more racing bike, SN2, was produced in the same released production order and then sold and shipped on another sales shipment.  

    The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer, Cannon Group PLC.  

    At the same time, they can see from the last three trace lines that another two items, SN3 and SN4, have been produced based on racing frames from LOT1. They take action to block these end items in inventory.  

    This completes the second defects management task using the **Item Tracing** page for defects management. Since the **Item Tracing** page is based on posted entries only, the quality controller must continue to the **Find entries** page to make sure that LOT1 is not used in non-posted documents.  

## Finding All Records of a Serial/Lot Number

 With the **Item Tracing** page, the quality controller learned that LOT1 contained the faulty racing frames, which vendor supplied them, and in which posted transaction they have been used. They must now determine whether LOT1 is in any open documents by integrating from the trace result to the **Find entries** page where they can perform a search through all database records.  

### To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records, such as open orders  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the first trace line, the purchase receipt of LOT1.  
2.  Choose the **Find entries** action.  

    The **Find entries** page is preset with search filters based on the trace result for LOT1. The quality controller recognizes most of the records as pertaining to documents already identified on the **Item Tracing** page. For example, the last Find Entries line of type Production Order refers to the two released production orders that consumed racing frames from LOT1.  

    However, the second Find Entries line of type **Sales Line** is a non-posted document line, so the quality controller proceeds to investigate.  

3.  To open the sales line record, select the second Find Entries line, choose the **Show** action. Alternatively, choose the value in the **No. of Records** field.  

    Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames. They immediately suggest to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order, based on good racing frames, be initiated.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how to use the **Find entries** page for defects management in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.

# Machine Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Machine Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each machine center. Use this report to ensure that machine centers aren't overloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/machine-center-load-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Machine Center Load Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/machine-center-load-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on machine centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded machine centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular machine center. Additionally, by monitoring the machine center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a machine center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for machine center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all machine centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The Machine Center Load report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Machine Center Capacity Effective](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#machine-center-capacity-effective)
- [Machine Center Allocated Time](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#machine-center-allocated-time)
- [Machine Center Availability After Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#machine-center-availability-after-orders)

# Responsible AI FAQ for summarize (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s summarize feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is summarize?

Business Central users often need an overview of their data and what urgently needs their attention to decide how to proceed with their tasks optimally.

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to generate an insightful summary of any record, making it effortless for people to learn what is important or urgent.

## What are the capabilities of summarize?

- A concise summary is displayed as a FactBox on most card and document pages in Business Central. It typically provides the top two or three insightful points as brief sentences.

- From the initial summary, users can select **Show more** to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens and generates additional points of interest.

- When any summary is displayed, Copilot makes it easy to review and learn about the facts referenced by the summary. These references are hyperlinked, so that users can quickly view or navigate to the source where they can explore details and take action.

While the summary text is AI-generated, each insight is grounded in factual data from Business Central. Copilot inherits the user's data permissions and can’t read any more data than the user already has access to.

## What is the intended use of summarize?

This feature helps people understand their business data, reduces the time it takes to sift through Business Central’s rich dataset, and makes Business Central easier to use. It isn't designed to make decisions on your behalf, provide recommendations, or advise on how to act or optimize your business.

Summaries don't automatically trigger actions on behalf of the user or the organization, and they don't persist to the database for other automated functions to use.

## How was summarize evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data supplemented with extra, fictitious business data and volume data. Testing primarily covered various fields and pages from Business Central’s base application, with some testing also carried out on custom pages and fields. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of ranked insights, use of language, grounding of values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various automated systems to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content.

Microsoft might turn off Copilot features for specific customers if abuse is detected.
 
Users can provide feedback on every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback and use it to improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons that are displayed alongside generated content.

## What are the AI limitations of summarize? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment
to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot because of the sensitive nature of that domain.

- Summaries about people

  Summaries about people, such as customers, vendors, or employees in Business Central, might result in limited output from Copilot because of other safety mechanisms designed to reduce the risk of inaccuracies. Even though Copilot isn't designed to provide recommendations or conclusions about people, you should use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions.

## What data does summarize collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to provide the service.

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your interactions with the feature. It doesn't collect summary texts or other company data used or collected by Copilot to generate summaries.

- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Manage master data synchronization

After you set up master data synchronization, when you synchronize for the first time [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

- Couples records in the selected tables.
- Creates a recurring job queue entry for each table.

The job queue entries automatically synchronize data in the subsidiary companies when someone makes a change in the source company. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> For the automatic synchronization to work, the user who makes the change in the source company must have:
>
> - A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
> - Permission sets that allow them to reschedule a background task in the subsidiary company. To learn more about the required license and permissions, go to [Before you start](admin-set-up-data-sync.md#before-you-start).
>
> Otherwise, the change happens in the next unconditional synchronization run. The unconditional synchronization is controlled by the **Inactivity Timeout Period** field on the job queue entry.

However, sometimes things go wrong, and there might be situations that you need to manage or investigate. For example, if people change the same record in both the source company and a subsidiary, synchronization fails so that you can specify the change that's correct. Or, the source company might install an extension that changes the schema of one of the tables you're synchronizing by adding a field or two. If you want to synchronize the new fields in the subsidiaries, install the same extensions and update the table schemas in their setup.

This article describes the tools you can use to keep synchronization running smoothly.

## Overwrite local changes

You can use the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on the fields and tables you synchronize to allow data from the source company to overwrite data in the subsidiary company.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable the synchronization of a field and allow the subsidiary to write values in it independently from the source company. You must either disable synchronization for the field, or allow the source company to overwrite local changes.

## Update table schemas

If the source company changes a table, for example, by adding a field that you want to synchronize, subsidiaries must update their field mappings. On the **Synchronization Fields** page, use the **Update Fields** action.

## Enable or disable couplings between records

To start or stop coupling on specific records on a table, on the **Synchronization Fields** page, choose the fields, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

## Run a full synchronization

The **Run Full Synchronization** action schedules a synchronization for all of the table records in the source company, and resynchronizes all records unconditionally. For example, resynchronization is useful if you enable an extra field on a synchronization table, or add an extra field by using the **Update Fields** action. The action retroactively synchronizes the data in those fields.

## Synchronize modified records

If you change a setting for a table or field in a subsidiary, you must update the synchronization. To update the synchronization, use the **Synchronize Modified Records** action on the **Synchronization Tables** page.

The **Synchronize Modified Records** action schedules a synchronization of the following table records:

* Records that failed to synchronize in the last attempt.
* Records that were changed in the source company after the last scheduled synchronization. You can review the last scheduled synchronization time on the **Synchronization Tables** page in the **Synchronize Changes Since** field.

The action works in the same way as a scheduled synchronization, and you can use it as a way to synchronize outside the schedule. For example, if you select the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on a field to allow data from the source company to overwrite local changes, the action updates that data. You can also just wait until the next scheduled synchronization happens.

## Investigate the status of synchronization

There are two actions on the **Synchronization Tables** page that can help you monitor your synchronization:

* **Integration Synchronization Jobs**
* **Job Queue Entries**

The following table describes the actions.

|Page  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Integration Synchronization Jobs**     | Open the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page to investigate what happened each time a job queue entry ran. To dig deeper into the details about new records that were added, or explore why a record failed to synchronize, choose the numbers in the **Inserted** or **Failed** columns. You can also use this page to clean up older records that you might not need. To learn more about cleaning up, go to [Clean up old entries](#clean-up-old-entries).        |
|**Job Queue Entries**     | Access details about the job queue entry that synchronize data for a selected table. For example, use this page to manage the status of the job queue entry,    To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you find an error on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page that you can't resolve yourself, if you contact your partner or Microsoft for support, it's helpful to provide the error message and callstack information.

## Clean up old entries

Over time, the number of entries in the synchronization log will become large, so you might want to do a little housekeeping to remove unneeded entries. To make it easier to clean up old entries, the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page offers the following actions:

* **Delete Entries Older Than 7 Days**
* **Delete All Entries**

## Adding extensions

If the source company installs a new extension, the subsidiary must also install it if they want to synchronize data for it. The subsidiary can use the **Update Fields** action On the **Synchronization Fields** page to add the tables from the extension to the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Some tables get data from related tables. If you add an extension that doesn't include related tables, the fields on those tables aren't available. Verify that you added all related tables.

<!--
## Recreate a deleted job queue entry

If the recurring job queue entry is deleted for a table, you can quickly recreate it. On the **Synchronization Tables** page, choose the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action.
-->

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

[!INCLUDE [finance_reports_consolidation](includes/finance-reports-consolidation-include.md)]

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# Cash flow overview

Understanding cash inflows and outflows are the key to running a successful business. You can use cash flow to easily create a short-term forecast that predicts how and when you expect money to be received and paid out by your business. It's important to know that your business will have enough cash to pay creditors and expenses when they're due.

## Definition of cash flow

The term *cash flow* is used to designate cash receipts minus cash payments over a selected period. It's an estimate of the amount of money that you expect to flow in and out of your business, and it includes all your forecasted income and expenses.

## Work with cash flow

The following illustration shows an overview of how you can work with cash flow.

![Cash Flow overview.](media/finance_cash_flow_overview.png "Cash Flow overview")

- You set up a cash flow forecast.  

- You get cash flow forecast sources from the following areas:  

  - General ledger – Information about the liquid funds and the budgeted revenues and expenses of your company.  
  - Purchasing – Information about the current payables and any forecasted debts from open purchase orders.  
  - Sales – Information about the current receivables and any forecasted receipts from open sales orders.  
  - Service – Information about open service orders.  
  - Fixed assets – Information about planned disposal and budgeted purchases of fixed assets.  
  - Manual revenues and expenses – Manage manual revenues and expenses and include them in the cash flow forecast.  
- You use a batch job to transfer information from the areas of general ledger, sales, purchasing, service, and fixed assets to the worksheet Then, you register worksheet lines to make a cash flow forecast.  
- You use various pages, reports, and charts to analyze and print a cash flow forecast that relates to availability and timeline overviews.  

## Making a cash flow forecast

Based on the registered worksheet lines, you can periodically make a cash flow forecast. The following layout is a frequently used layout for a cash flow forecast. The layout has three sections:

- Cash receipts  
- Cash disbursements  
- Net cash flow or cash-in-hand  

Cash receipts provide details of the income that the business receives.

*total cash receipts* = *receivables* + *open sales orders* + *open service orders* + *fixed assets disposals* + *manual revenues* + *budgeted revenues*

> [!NOTE]
> Manual revenues can be rental income, interest from financial assets, or new private capital. You can plan manual revenues for a period of time and use them in the calculation of cash flow forecast.

Cash disbursements provide details of the payments made by the business.

*total cash disbursements* = *payables* + *open purchase orders* + *fixed asset investment* + *manual expenses* + *budgeted expenses*

> [!NOTE]
> Manual expenses can be salaries, interest on credit, or private consumptions. You can plan manual expenses for a period of time and use them in the calculation of cash flow forecast.

Net cash flow or cash-in-hand is calculated as total receipts minus total disbursements at the end of each period.

*net cash flow* = *total cash receipts* – *total cash disbursements* + *liquid funds*

You can use the forecast as an internal management decision-making tool that helps you plan ahead and make important strategic decisions about the operation of the business.

# Tell Me FAQ

This article answers questions that our advanced users often ask about the Tell me what you want to do feature.

## Are all actions from my current page discoverable in Tell Me?

No. Actions in parts, such as the Sales Lines part or FactBoxes, aren't displayed in Tell Me.

## Can I search for a specific record?

Yes. For example, if you want to quickly find a sales order, enter it's identifier, and then choose the **Search company data** action. If you only know the customer's name, enter that. Tell Me arranges results by type, so you could find the order under the Sales Orders category.

## Are the results in Tell Me filtered by permissions?

If the user doesn't have AccessByPermissions, then actions aren't displayed. However, pages and reports appear in the results but require that the user has permission to access them. A message displays if the user doesn't have permission to view the object.

## Does Tell Me display content from my customizations or installed third-party extensions?

Actions, pages, and reports that originate from extensions are picked up by Tell Me. For technical information about how to make custom pages and reports discoverable, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality).

## What makes this different from what was previously known as Page Search?

Page Search has evolved into Tell Me to help you get work done quickly. Page Search could only help you navigate to pages or reports. At a technical level, Tell Me is no longer based on the legacy MenuSuite concept.

## I use on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Does that include Tell Me?

You can use Tell Me in the on-premises Web Client to find actions, pages, and reports, but not apps and consulting services on AppSource.

## Is Tell Me available for all form factors?

Yes. It was introduced on phones and tablets in Business Central 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, it must be enabled in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) using the **Feature: Search for pages and data in the mobile app** switch. In 2024 rlease wave 1 and later, it's always enabled.

<!-- removed in v20 because of Help pane
### Are the documentation results available in any language?
The help articles display in the language you have specified in **My Settings**, if help is available in that language.
-->

## Does Tell Me give me help on how to use pages, reports, and other things?

No, but you can easily get this information from the Help pane. Just select the **Search Help** action in the **Tell me what you want to do** page or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard. To learn more about the Help pane, go to [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane).

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

# Receive items with warehouse receipts

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about how to handle inbound items, go to [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following article refers to methods C and D in the previous table.

## Receive items with a warehouse receipt

When items arrive at a warehouse that processes warehouse receipts, get the lines of the document that triggered the receipt. If you use bins, you can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in. The latter might be required when you receive an item for the first time. Then, enter the quantities of the items you received and post the receipt.  

You can create warehouse receipt in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to create a warehouse receipt for a source document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee can create a **Warehouse Receipt** for one or more released source documents.

The following procedure describes how to create a warehouse receipt in a pull fashion.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Fill in the **Location Code** field on the **General** FastTab. When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information is copied to each line.

    For a location that requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  

3. You can get source document in two ways:

    1. Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires receipt.
    2. Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs. - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select Source Document Filter and run it. All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

4. Set the quantity to receive.

    The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed. 

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Receive** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the received quantities. To add the outstanding quantities from the source document again, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Receive** action.  

    On a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field. If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded. If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed.

5. Post the warehouse receipt. The quantity fields are updated on the source documents, and the items are added to inventory.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use warehouse put-aways (method D in the table in the beginning of this article), the items are received. However, you can't pick them until they're put away. To learn more about putting away items, go to [Put Items Away with Warehouse Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md).
    >
    > Otherwise, consider using the **Post and Print** action. The action posts the receipt and prints it as a put-away instruction that shows where to put the item.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your warehouse uses cross-docking, you can check whether you can cross-dock items without putting them away. To learn more about cross-docking, go to [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse receipt, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that specify the items to receive.

1. In the warehouse receipt, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Inbound** page appears.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example, you can select types of source documents, such as purchase or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page on which you activated the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page, and they're available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

To receive items with warehouse class codes other than the class code of the bin in the **Bin Code** field on the document header, clear the **Bin Code** field on the header before you retrieve source document lines for the items.  
<!-- TBD, table with comparison of various options-->

If bins are mandatory for a location, zone and bin codes are added to warehouse receipt documents as follows:

* For advanced configurations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the receipt bin code from the **Location Card** page for the location. If a receipt bin code isn't specified, no bin is specified. If the item and receipt bins don't match, the receipt bin code is blank.
* In other configurations, if a receipt bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Undo Assembly Posting

Undo the posting of an assembly order to correct a mistake or remove an unwanted posting.

When you undo a posted assembly order, corrective item ledger entries are created to reverse the original entries. Each positive output entry for the assembly item is reversed by a negative output entry. Each negative consumption entry for an assembly component is reversed by a positive consumption entry. Fixed cost application is automatically created between the corrective and original entries to ensure exact cost reversal.  

When you undo a fully posted assembly order, you can recreate the original order. For example, to make corrections before you post it again.  

When you undo a partially posted assembly order, all affected quantity fields, such as the **Assembled Quantity**, **Consumed Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity** fields, are restored to the values they had before the posting.  

To recreate or restore assembly orders, the item in the original posting must meet the following conditions:  

* It's still in inventory. That is, it hasn't been sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions.  
* It isn't reserved.  
* It's in the bin that it was output to.  

Assembly orders can only be restored if the number and sequence of lines on the original assembly order aren't changed.  

> [!TIP]  
> To resolve conflicts caused by changes in the lines, manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the posted assembly order. You can post the assembly order and then recreate it when you undo the posting.  

The following procedure describes how to undo posted assembly orders that contain items that were assembled-to-stock. To undo posted assembly orders with items that were assembled-to-order, use the **Undo Shipment** action on the related posted shipment. To learn more about undoing shipments, go to [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md). Undoing the posted assembly order happens in the same way as described in that article.  

## To undo posting of an assembly order

You can undo fully or partially posted assembly orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Assembly Orders**, and choose the related link.  

   Each partial posting creates a separate posted assembly order.  
2. Open the posted assembly order that you want to undo, and then choose the **Undo Assembly** action.  

    If the posted assembly order is related to a fully posted assembly order that's been deleted, you can recreate then deleted order. For example, you might recreate the order because you want to reprocess it.  
3. To recreate the assembly order, choose **Yes**. To undo the posting without recreating the assembly order, choose **No**.  

The **Reversed** field on the assembly order changes to **Yes**. The assembly order posting is now reversed. You can process the entire assembly order if you chose to recreate it, or the open assembly order that you have restored to its original state.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To restore quantities from multiple partial postings in an assembly order, you must undo all the posted assembly orders by following steps 1 through 3.

# Use e-documents in the purchase process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following purchase documents:

- Purchase invoices
- Purchase orders
- Purchase credit memos
- General journals

> [!NOTE]
> When you receive an e-document from a specific vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the e-document with the vendor by verifying the following information in this order:
>
> 1. **GLN** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **VAT Registration No.** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Participation Identifier** from the **Service Participant** page (using the **E-Document Service Participation** field from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Name** and **Address** (from the Vendor card)

## E-documents in purchases

You can receive purchase e-documents manually, or by using the **Receive** batch job.  

### Set up vendors to work with different purchase documents  

Follow these steps to configure vendors for incoming electronic invoices:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then select the related link.
1. Choose the vendor you want to configure.
1. On the **Receiving** FastTab, in the **Receive E-Document To** field, specify the default purchase document you want to generate from the received e-document.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - In the **Receive E-Document To** field, you can either select a **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Order** based on what you want to create from the received e-invoice. This selection doesn't affect the creation of corrective documents. In both scenarios, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates a credit memo.
   >
   > - If you choose the **Purchase Order** option in the **Receive E-Document To** field, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tries to update one of the existing purchase orders. However, if the purchase order for a vendor in the received e-document doesn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new purchase order, using the same approach as creating a new purchase invoice explained in this [article later](#work-with-purchase-invoices).

1. Choose one of the options you want to use for the selected vendor.
1. Close the page.

### Work with purchase invoices  

#### Run the batch job  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job automates the process of collecting your incoming invoices. It works only in countries or regions where the functionality is available.  

Every time a **Job Queue** runs, if the external service has incoming invoices from your vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] collects and imports those invoices. To complete the process, follow these steps:

1. After the batch job finishes running, the imported invoices are listed on the **E-Documents** page with their basic details.
1. To view more details, open a specific e-document.
1. Depending on whether your e-document setup automatically processes invoices, or requires that you review and confirm the details before processing, follow these steps. Learn more in [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) for information about how to require confirmation.

   **Automatic processing**

   1. If you automatically process invoices, and there are no errors or issues in the e-document, the **Record** field maps the document number of the purchase invoice if a number series is specified on the **Vendor Card** page. To open the document, select the link.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]-created document isn't the posted document.

1. To go directly to the purchase document, select the **Record** field. After you open the **Purchase Invoice** page, check the document. If everything is correct, post the document.  
1. When you post the purchase document, the **Record** field on the **E-Document** updates from **Invoice** to **Purchase Invoice**, and the number of the posted purchase document is available. You can select the number to open it.
   Details about logs are the same as they are in the sales process for e-documents.  

   **Review and confirm before processing**

   1. If you must review and confirm the details before processing the invoice, open the document.
   1. On the **E-Document** page, choose the **View extracted data** action.
   1. On the **Received purchase document data** page, review the details. If things look good, choose **OK**.
   1. To process the invoice, follow the steps described for **Automatic processing**.

   > [!TIP]
   > When you receive an incoming e-document, it's typically in XML or similar format that can be difficult, if not impossible, to read. For example, if you aren't technical and don't understand the XML format, it might be hard to review an invoice before you process it. To make it easier for everyone to review incoming e-documents, invoices and credit memos have an **E-invoice Lines** FastTab that displays details from the imported file, such as line and header information, in a way that's easy to understand.
   >
   > The preview feature is only available for invoice and credit memo types of incoming e-documents.

### Handle errors and warnings

Errors in the sales process are mostly related to the availability of the service. The incoming document can contain multiple reasons for errors. The most common reason is that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't recognize the lines on an e-document from your vendor and can't enter lines in your purchase invoice.

There are two common errors:  

- If you want to use a specific line from your vendor invoice that was directly posted to the general ledger (G/L) account, you must correctly configure the **Mapping Text** value. To bypass this error when using G/L accounts, select the **Map Text to Account** to create a specific mapping of the **Mapping Text** value with the **Debit Acc. No.**. Learn more about [account mapping](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md#map-text-on-an-e-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).  
- If you want to track the inventory and use lines from your vendor invoice to fill in the items on your document lines, you must correctly configure the **Item Reference No.** value. To bypass this error, map external items with your item numbers by using the item reference list. Learn more in [use item references](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

After you fix the errors and warnings, you can manually specify when to create a purchase invoice based on your setup by selecting **Create Document**.

### Recreate a deleted purchase invoice or credit memo

Mistakes happen, so it's important to be able to fix them quickly. If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo and can't link the incoming e-document to the correct one, you can now recreate a new purchase document based on details in the e-document. Problem solved, and you can go take care of other business.

If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo, you can't proceed with the e-document connection with the regular purchase document in Business Central. To get yourself unstuck, you can run the **Recreate Document** action from the e-document. The action creates an unposted purchase invoice or credit memo based on the type of incoming document, its information, and the G/L mapping or item references used.

> [!NOTE]
> The action works only with unposted purchase invoices and credit memos. It doesn't work for purchase orders.

#### Map text on an e-document to a specific vendor account

To map lines with expenses for E-Documents, you need to map descriptions with **G/L Account**. Then, use the **Map Text to Account** action to link specific text on a vendor invoice from the **E-Document Service** to a vendor account. Any part of the E-document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on the resulting document or journal lines of type **G/L Account** are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping text to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account for electronic documents related to paid expenses. This option creates a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant E-Document line with the displayed error message and then choose **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page displays.
1. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that appears on vendor invoices for which you want to create purchase documents or journal lines. You can enter up to 50 characters.
1. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
1. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that is inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use the **Credit Acc. No.**, **Bal. Source Type**, and **Bal. Source No.** fields with E-documents.

1. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all error messages on E-documents that you want to automatically create **G/L Accounts** and documents for.  

#### Manually import one or more invoices  

To manually import one or more external e-documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Service**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **E-Document Service** page, select the active service.
1. Select **Receive**, and upload the e-document file that you got from the vendor.
1. If an error message occurs, open the e-document to fix the issues.
1. When you finish fixing the issues, in the **Import Manually** group, select **Create Document**.  
1. After you create the document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], using a batch job doesn't change the way you view it.

#### Work with attachments  

Peppol and similar e-invoicing files are machine-readable formats that aren't easy for people to read. To improve reading, Peppol made it possible to embed a PDF file into the Peppol BIS 3 format as a binary object. If your incoming Peppol BIS 3 file has an embedded PDF, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically processes it and adds the PDF as an attachment to the purchase document after creating it.

## E-documents with purchase orders  

### Link purchase orders with the received e-documents

If your **Vendor** configured the **Received E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, once an electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from external end point), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following steps:  

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the receive **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links this **E-Document** with the mentioned **Purchase Order**, and the **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Order linked**. This link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**. If you need to change the **Purchase Order** linked automatically, you can do it using the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and manually select one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor. You can only do it before matching the lines between **E-Document** and **Purchase Order**.  

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists but there's no purchase order number in the received **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the possibility to choose one of the existing purchase orders when and if you uploaded this document manually. This condition opens the **Purchase Orders** list with orders only for the vendor from whom you received the **E-Document**. You need to select the **Purchase Order** you want and then select **OK**. If you failed to select the correct **Purchase Order**, or obtained the **E-Document** automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, a new **E-Document** isn't linked to any purchase document. The **Document Status** then shows **Error**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage also shows **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking with the **Purchase Order**, select the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and choose one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor.

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor doesn't exist when a new **E-Document** is created, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new **Purchase Order**, using the same model of creation that already exists for new **Purchase Invoices**. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **Processed**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Imported document created**. After which, this link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**.

### Match lines from received e-document with purchase order  

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase orders' lines from two different places: from the **E-Document** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to locate the already linked **Purchase Orders** is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile as a part of **E-Document Activities**. All nonlinked documents can be found using the tile **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** where you have a list of **E-Documents** that you need to review. The **E-Document Activities** with these two tiles can be found in the following **Role Centers**: Business Manager Evaluation, Business Manager, Accountant, Inventory Manager, and Shipping and Receiving.

> [!TIP]
> There are two ways to match lines. One way is to do it manually, as described in the article. The other way is to use the **E-document matching assistance with Copilot**. The E-document matching assistance feature helps you match received electronic invoices with existing purchase order lines by using large language modules (LLM) model. Learn more about [using Copilot][Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot](map-edocuments-with-copilot.md).
> [!NOTE]
> If the VAT percentage differs between the incoming document and the company's VAT percentage, matching documents can't be used in a multi-country environment.  

#### Match lines from purchase order  

You can match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list or from one of the opened **Purchase Orders**. To begin the process, use the following steps:  

1. Select the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center if there's a number.
1. Choose one of the two options for matching:

   - If you want to match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list, select the **Purchase Order** line that you want to match and select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.  
   - If you want to first open the **Purchase Order**, open the document and then select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.
1. Because both options have the same process, the **Purchase Order Matching** page opens with the following content:

    1. In the header, you can find the following information, which can help you to map the lines easier:

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |Vendor Name |Specifies the vendor’s name of the electronic document. |
       |E-Document No. |Specifies the linked electronic document number. |
       |E-Document Date |Specifies the linked electronic document date.  |
       |E-Document Amount |Specifies the linked e-document total amount including VAT. |

    1. In the lines, you can find the lines imported from the **E-Document** file on the left side and the lines from the existing **Purchase Order** on the right.  
    1. All lines on both sides have item numbers and descriptions, together with the **Direct Unit Cost** and **Line Discount %**.  
    1. On the **Imported Lines** side, you can also locate the **Quantity** field as a total quantity from e-invoice and the **Matched Quantity** field specifying the quantity that is already matched to the purchase order lines.
    1. On the **Purchase Orders Lines** side, you can also find the **Available Quantity** as the quantity that can be matched to this line (received, but not invoiced quantity) and **Qty. to Invoice**, specifying the quantity that is already matched to this line.
    1. To match lines, select the lines on both sides that you want to match and select the **Match Manually** action. The matched lines are marked in green.
    1. It's possible to match one to one, but it's also possible to match many to one or one to many, by selecting more lines on one side or the other before you choose the **Match Manually** action.
    1. You can also select the **Match Automatically** action to automatically match all lines with the same **Type**, **No.**, **Unit Price**, **Discount**, and **Unit of Measure**.
    1. If you make a mistake, you can select the **Remove Match** action to remove the matched lines on the purchase order side or select the **Reset Matching** action to reset all matches.
    1. If your **E-Document** has many lines, you can select the **Show Pending Lines** action during the matching process to remove all the e-document lines if they're already matched. If you need to view all the lines, you can always select the **Show All Lines** action.

1. After you finish the matching, select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action.
1. After you apply the matching to the purchase order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the following fields:

    1. The **Vendor Invoice No.** and **Document Date** fields on the document header update with values from the electronic document that you received and linked.
    1. The **Qty. to Invoice** field on the lines update with the values from the **Qty. to Invoice** column from the **Purchase Order Matching** page based on the match.
    1. Now you can post the document by choosing the **Post** action.  
    1. After you post the document, the value in the **Document** field on the **E-Document** page changes to relate to the **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
    1. Close the page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you can match only the lines that have the same total amount in both documents. That means **Direct Unit Cost** together with the applied Line **Discount %** must be the same, because in one document you can have an amount without discount and in another with discount.  

If you want to add tolerance and allow the difference between lines in e-invoice and purchase order, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. Allow tolerance in the **E-Document Matching Difference %** field by specifying the maximum percentage of cost difference to allow when matching an incoming e-document line with a purchase order line.
1. This setup applies to all the matching lines, but considers the tolerance for the total amount, as for **Direct Unit Cost** together with applied **Line Discount %**.  
1. Close the page.

##### Other options

If your inbound electronic invoice has lines that aren't on your purchase order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from posting the document because you can't partially post an incoming invoice. Therefore, you must ensure that you all invoice lines are correctly mapped to the purchase order. If you experience this issue, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. On the **Imported Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page, choose the line that doesn't exist on the purchase order. Now choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AssistEdit button."::: button, and choose the **Create Purchase Order Line** action.
1. On the **E-Doc. Create Purch Order Line** page, in the **Type** field, choose the type of line you want to create in your purchase order. You can choose any of type.
1. Based on the line type, you can choose the **No.** to specify what you received. For example, an item, general ledger account, resource, and so on.
1. The unit of measure, quantity, amount, discount, and other values are copied from the inbound invoice line.
1. You can select the **Learn matching rule** field to specify whether to create a matching rule. This feature works only for items and G/L accounts. Item references are created for items and text to account mappings are created for G/L accounts.
1. Select **OK**.
1. A purchase order line is created on the purchase order, and you can map it on the **Purchase Order Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the quantity, the unit amount recalculates to the same total amount as the original invoice line.

#### Matching lines from e-document  

You can match the lines on the **E-Document** page. To begin, use the following steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Documents**, and then select the related link.
1. Select the **E-Document** that you want to match.
1. Choose the **Match Purchase Order** action to open the **Purchase Order Matching** page.  
1. Repeat the same steps that you used when you started matching from purchase orders.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** Role Center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Incoming e-documents:**
  - Processed
  - In Progress
  - Error

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

* The interaction template that you used to create the interaction. To learn more about setting up templates, go to [Set up interaction templates](marketing-interactions.md#set-up-interaction-templates).
* The segment that you created the interaction for. To learn more about segments, go to [Manage Interactions for Segments](marketing-interaction-segments.md).

## View attachments

Attachments are available when you view recorded interactions on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. Choose the **Show Attachments** action.

## Types of files you can attach

Attachments can be almost any type of file, such as Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel or text files.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Word, which lets you use features such as merge fields on Word templates. To learn more about using Word templates, go to [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).

## What you can do with attachments

You can perform the following actions with attachments:

* **Open**: Start the associated program—Microsoft Word, for example—and the document opens. You can then modify it.
* **Import**: Import attachments. For example, you can scan a received letter, import it, and attach it to the interaction that records the reception of that letter.
* **Export**: Export attachments to a location on a disk file.
* **Remove**: Remove the current attachment from an interaction template.
* **Copy**: Copy attachments from another interaction template.

# Set Up Bin Types

You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities. You give each bin its basic flow activities, and thereby define the way a bin is used, by assigning it a bin type.  

There are six types. You can operate your warehouse with all of the six possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.  

## To set up the bin types you want to use

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Bin Types** page, create a 10-character code for a bin type.  
3.  Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location.  

The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document, and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement.  

The bin types that you can create are listed below.  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used only for picking, for example, for items with an approaching expiration date that you have moved into this type of bin. You would place a high bin ranking on these bins so they are suggested for picking first.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|

# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and accounts from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information and then open an assisted setup guide to upload the data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
For more information, see [Importing Business Data from Other Finance Systems](across-import-data-configuration-packages.md).

## Data from QuickBooks desktop

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to Business Central:

- Customers  
- Vendors  
- Items  
- Chart of Accounts  
- Beginning Balance transactions in General Ledger  
- On-hand Quantities for Inventory Items  
- Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos and payments  

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:

- The sale of items or services to customers  
- The purchase of items or services from vendors  
- Adjustments in the general ledger  

Business Central requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks.
If transactions in QuickBooks have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in Business Central before you can post transactions.

In order to get your data out of the QuickBooks desktop application you will need to download the Microsoft Data Exporter Tool.  The instructions for the tool are in the Data Migration Wizard in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tool will connect to your QuickBooks application and export the applicable data to a .zip file.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the data exporter tool only works with QuickBooks 2017 and 2018.

## Finding the QuickBooks data migration extension

The QuickBooks Data Migration extension is installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the Data Migration assisted setup guide. If you are ready to get started now, and have exported your data from QuickBooks, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.  

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status Unposted, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the Sales Invoices page. To review payment journals, go to the Payment Journals page.
There are a few things in particular that you should do:
If the transactions in QuickBooks had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in Business Central before you post them.
If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|
| **Project Costs Applied Account** |A balancing account to the WIP Costs Account, which is a contra for a negative expense account. Used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project*. | Applied Costs, Recognized Costs|
| **Item Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Resource Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **G/L Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Project Costs Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Accrued Costs account, which is an expense account. | Accrued Costs|
| **G/L Expense Acc. (Budget)** |The sales account that will be used for general ledger expenses in project tasks with this posting group. If left empty, the general ledger account entered on the project planning line is used. | |
| **WIP Accrued Sales Account** |The WIP account for the calculated sales value of the WIP, which is an accrued revenue account for your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the recognized revenue, you post to this account. | Accrued Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** |The account for the invoiced sales value of the WIP that is not able to be recognized. It is a balance sheet Unearned Revenue account. | Recognized Sales, Applied Sales|
| **Project Sales Applied Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Invoiced Sales account, which is a contra income account. | Applied Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **Project Sales Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Project Sales Account, which is an income account. | Accrued Sales|
| **Recognized Costs Account** |The expense account that contains the recognized costs for the project. It is a debit expense account ordinarily. | Recognized Costs|
| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension

The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension makes it easier, and more accurate, to send data to your banks. The extension connects [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central service, which can convert bank data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into formats that are required by over 600 banks around the world. For example, this makes it easier to transfer payments and credits to vendors by entering the payments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then uploading them to your bank. The formats can also smooth out bank reconciliation processes. For more information, see [AMC Banking for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.amcbanking.com/bc-fundamentals/).

> [!NOTE]
> AMC Banking has built additional extensions that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This topic describes only the Fundamental extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process.

## Use our demonstration account

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with a demonstration account that lets you try out the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. We provide default settings for connecting to AMC Banking, specifying the bank accounts to get data from in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus a few data exchange definitions. You can view the connection settings on the **AMC Banking Setup** page. For bank accounts, the extension applies values in the **Bank Name**, **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**, **Bank Statement Import Format**, and **Payment Export Format** fields on bank account cards.

We provide the settings, but to try out the extension you must run the assisted setup guide to apply them. To run the guide, on the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some limitations on the demo account. For example, when you convert payments, the amount in the converted file will not match the actual amount. Instead, the amount will always be five units of the currency that you use for payments.  

## Setting up the extension

Getting started with the extension involves just a few easy steps, and an assisted setup guide will make the connection and turn on the extension. The guide helps you things like install the data exchange definitions for bank statement export/import setups and initiate the number series used for credit transfer messages.  

### To set up the required permission sets

Before people can use this extension, your administrator must copy the following permission sets, edit them, and then assign the new permission sets to users instead of original:

* **D365 Basic**
* **D365 Team Member**
* **D365 Read**
* **IntelligentCloudBC**

For more information, see [To copy a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#copy-a-permission-set).

For each new permission set, grant only the **Read** permission for the **AMC Banking Setup table (20101)**. For more information, see [To create or modify permissions manually](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs
- Routings  
- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP system that includes integrated tools to make bookkeeping easier in the system. Many actions can be done automatically.

This article provides an outline of bookkeeping processes, including the rules, procedures, and other guidelines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The content of this article is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers complete their daily work in this ERP system. For additional help, a context-based assistant is incorporated into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Managing Database Access Intent

As a super user or administrator, you can change the database access intent on reports, pages of the type API, and queries to improve performance of the service.

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set up to use read-only replicas of the primary (read-write) database. Using the database replica reduces the load on the primary database. In some cases, it will also improve the performance when viewing data in the client. Replicas are beneficial for objects, like reports, queries, and API pages, that are used for viewing data only, not modifying data.

When objects run, the database access intent determines whether to use a read-only replica, if one is available, or the primary database. Reports, API pages, and queries are developed with a predefined database access intent (see [DatabaseAccessIntent property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataaccessintent-property)).

The **Database Access Intent List** page lets you override the predefined database access intent for objects when they're run.

In database terms, this feature is commonly known as *read scale-out*. For more information about read-scale out and data access intent in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Utilizing Read Scale-Out for Better Performance](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and Administration help.

## To change the database access intent

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Database Access Intent List**, and then choose the related link.

    The page lists all reports, pages, and queries. The **Access Intent** column includes one of the following values:

    |**Setting**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |**Default**|Indicates that the object uses the predefined database access intent.|
    |**Allow Write**|Sets the object to use the primary database, allowing the user to modify data.|
    |**Read Only**|Sets the object to use the database replica, which means that the user can only view data, not change data.|

2. Choose the **Edit List** action.

3. On the **Edit - Database Access Intent List** page, change the **Access Intent** field for the objects.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an object that is editable, like the Customer Card, is set to **Read Only**, the primary database will still be used, regardless of the access intent, allowing users to make changes as normal.

# Manage attachments, links, and notes on cards and documents

On most list pages, cards, and documents, you can attach files, add links, and write notes on the **Attachments** tab of the **FactBox** pane. The number in the tab title indicates how many attached files, links, or notes exist for the card or document.

On the **Lines** FastTab, you can also use the **Attachments** action to attach documents to a specific line. For example, you might want to attach design specifications to an item on a purchase invoice.

Attachments, links, and notes stay attached to the card or document while it's processed into other states. For example, from an ongoing sales order to a posted sales invoice. However, none of the attachment types are output from the system, for example, when printing or when saving to a file.

You can also add attachments to the emails you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you send an email directly from a document, such as a sales quote, the **Add file from source document** action lets you choose files that are attached to it. You can only choose files that are attached to the document. You can't choose files that are attached to lines.

> [!NOTE]
> When you partially ship and invoice a sales or purchase order, the attachment will only be attached to the final invoice of the order. Similarly, when you invoice deferrals, the attachment is attached to the G/L entries for the document but not for the deferral entries.
>
> If you delete an order before it is invoiced, the attachment is also removed.
>
> When you use the **Get Receipt Lines** action on a purchase invoice, the attachment on the related purchase order is added to the purchase invoice.

## Attach a file to a purchase invoice

You can attach any type of file, such as text, image, or video files, to a card, document, or a line on a document. This is useful, for example, when you want to store a vendor's invoice as a PDF file on the related purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached with the Incoming Documents feature aren't included on the **Attachments** tab. Learn more in [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md). The same is true for files that are attached to lines on documents.

The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your attachment is specific to a line on a document, you can attach it to the line. Select the line, and then choose the **Attachments** action.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to.
1. On the **FactBox** pane, choose the **Attachments** tab.
1. Do one of the following steps:

   - Select **Documents**, and then select **Upload files**. 
   - Select **Documents**, select **Show details**, and then select **Attach files**.
1. On the **Select files** dialog box, do one of the following steps to attach a file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The file is now attached to the purchase invoice.

## View an attached file

1. On the FactBox, select the **Attachments** tab.
1. Under **Documents**, select the attachment you want to view.

   If you select a PDF file, it opens in your browser. Other files download to your device, where you can open them.

## Save a document as a PDF attachment

Whenever you need to save a document as a file, you can use the **Attach as PDF** action to capture the current document content as a PDF file attached to the FactBox of the document. This is useful, for example, when documents follow multiple steps in a process, such as a sales process or an approval workflow, and you want to refer to a printout of the previous step.

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all supported documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a sales order, and then choose the **Attach as PDF** action.

A PDF file with the current content of the sales order is added to the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.

## To add a link from an item card

You can add a link from a card or document to any URL. This is useful, for example, when you want to link an item card with the supplier's item catalog.

The following procedure is based on an item card. The steps are similar for all other supported cards and documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item that you want to add a link from, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Links**, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Link Address** field, enter the link.

    The link must be a valid internet or intranet URL.

5. In the **Description** field, enter any information about the link.  
6. Select the **OK** button.

The link is now attached to the item card.  

## Write a note on a sales order

You can write a note on a document or card, for example, to communicate special instructions to other users of the document or card. You can include file links and URLs in notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on the **Attachments** tab aren't related to internal notes functionality, which is mainly used to communicate between workflow users. Learn more in [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to write a note on, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Notes** section, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Note** field, write any text, such as "This is an urgent order."
5. Select the **OK** button.

The note is now attached to the sales order.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About this walkthrough  

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use the **Inventory Put-away** page to record and post put-away and receipt information for your inbound source documents. The following documents are inbound source documents:

* Purchase order
* Sales return order
* Inbound transfer order
* Production order with output that's ready to be put away

> [!NOTE]
> Even though the settings are called **Require Pick** and **Require Put-away**, you can still post receipts and shipments directly from the source business documents at locations where you select these checkboxes.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

* Set up SILVER location for inventory put aways.  
* Set up SILVER location for bin handling.  
* Define a default bin for item LS-81. (LS-75 is already set up in CRONUS.)  
* Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 for 40 loudspeakers.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are preset by setup.  
* Release the purchase order for warehouse handling.  
* Create an inventory put-away based on a released source document.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are inherited from the purchase order.  
* Register the warehouse movement into the warehouse and post the purchase receipt for the source purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Roles  

The following user roles perform the tasks that this walkthrough demonstrates:  

* Warehouse Manager  
* Purchasing Agent  
* Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites  

To complete this walkthrough, you'll need:  

* CRONUS International Ltd. data  
* To be a warehouse employee at SILVER location. To set yourself up, follow these steps:  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your user account on the **Users** page.  
    3. In the **Location Code** field, choose **SILVER**.  
    4. Select the **Default** checkbox.  

## Story  

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS International Ltd., creates a purchase order for 10 units of item LS-75 and 30 units of item LS-81 from vendor 10000 to be delivered to SILVER Warehouse. When the delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, puts the items away in the default bins defined for the items. When John posts the put-away, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

## Setting up the location  

Settings on the **Location Card** page define the company's warehouse flows.  

### To set up the location  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the SILVER location card.  
3. Turn on the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

    Set up a default bin for the two item numbers to control where they're put away.  

4. Choose the **Bins** action.  
5. Select the first row, for bin **S-01-0001**, and then choose the **Contents** action.  

    Notice on the **Bin Content** page that item **LS-75** is already set up as content in bin S-01-0001.  

6. Choose the **New** action.  
7. Select the **Fixed** and the **Default** fields.  
8. In the **Item No.** field, enter **LS-81**.  

## Create the purchase order  

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Bin code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |LS_75|SILVER|S-01-0001|10|  
    |LS-81|SILVER|S-01-0001|30|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The bin code is entered automatically according to the setup you created in the [Setting up the location](#setting-up-the-location) section.  

    Next, notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    The delivery of loudspeakers from vendor 10000 has arrived at SILVER warehouse, and John proceeds to put them away.  

## Receive and put the items away  

Use the **Inventory Put-away** page to manage all inbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive and put the items away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Purchase Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the purchase from vendor 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the purchase order.  

5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 30 respectively on the two inventory put-away lines.  

6. Choose the **Post** action, select the **Receive** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 40 loudspeakers are now registered as put away in bin S-01-0001, and a positive item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted purchase receipt.

# (Obsolete) Import and Export Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

You can import and export an existing custom report layout as a file to and from a location on your computer and network. For example, you can export a report layout, and then send the file to another person to modify. That person can then make the modifications to layout and return the file to you so that you can import it back.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You cannot import or export built-in report layouts.  

### To export a report layout to a file  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  Select the row for the report that contains the custom report layout that you want to export, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

3.  On the **Report Layouts** page, select the report layout that you want to export to a file, and then choose the **Export Layout** action.  

4.  In the **Export File** dialog box, choose the **Save** button, and then save the file to a location on your computer or network.  

### To import a report layout file  

1.  Make sure that the relevant file that defines the report layout is available on your computer or network.  

     A Word report layout file must have the .docx file type extension. An RDLC report layout file must have the .rdlc or .rdl file type extension.  

2.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

3.  Select the row for the report to which you want to import the report layout, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

4.  On the **Report Layouts** page, select the report layout to which you want to import the file, and then choose the **Import Layout** action.  

5.  In the **Import** dialog box, select the document that defines the report layout, and then choose the **Open** button.  

 The original custom report layout is replaced with the imported report layout.

# Suggest number series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how you can quickly generate number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with assistance from Copilot.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The suggest number series feature is activated. An administrator must complete this task. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## About number series suggestions with Copilot

For each company you set up in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must assign unique identifiers to things like:

- General ledger accounts
- Customer and vendor accounts
- Invoices and other documents

Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

By letting you use natural language or structured input, Copilot can reduce the time it takes to set up number series and make it easier to maintain them. For example, when you need to update year or month-based numbering for many draft and posted documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Review the suggestions and refine your prompt

You can set up number series for one or more specific entities, such as items, or one or more feature areas (modules), such as Inventory, Finance, Sales, and Purchasing, and so on.

For specific entities, such as purchase orders, Copilot might also suggest blanket purchase orders and purchase return orders.

For feature areas, Copilot looks at the fields on the **Numbering** FastTab on the related setup page. For example, for Inventory, it looks at the FastTab on the **Inventory Setup** page. For Sales and Purchasing, it looks at the FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables** and **Purchases & Payables** pages. However, it also looks at related entities, which means it might suggest series for entities that aren't on the setup page. For example, when you create a series for Warehouse Management, Copilot might suggest a series for items.

We recommend that you carefully review the results and adjust your prompt to exclude unwanted series. For example, both the Warehouse and Inventory areas might suggest series for items. To avoid a conflict, you can exclude items in your prompt for one of those areas.

## Generate number series

Copilot can help you create and update number series on the **No. Series** page. The **Generate** action opens the **Generate No. Series with Copilot** dialog where you can enter a prompt.

To help you write the prompt, the Prompt Guide :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-guide-icon.png" alt-text="Show the Prompt Guide icon."::: button provides sets of prompts that you can use as-is, or as inspiration.

- Create entirely new number series.
- Change and update numbering in existing series.
- Create a new number series for the next year.

After you enter your prompt and choose **Generate**, Copilot creates proposals for one or more number series. You can review the proposals in the **No. Series Proposals** view. You can remove the proposals that you don't like, and edit the ones you do. When you're ready, you can choose **Keep it** to add or update a proposal. In addition, Copilot updates various setup pages with the number series you decided to keep.

## Examples of prompts

|Intent  |Prompt  |
|---------|---------|
|Create a number series that includes a year. For accountants, including a year on numbers for posted documents can make it easier to find hard copies in folders.     |Create contract credit memo number series. Make sure it includes the last two digits of the current year.         |
|Maintain number series and prepare for next year.     | Set up a contract credit memo number series in the service management module for the next year.        |
|Create number series in a completely empty company. This is where Copilot can save your hours, or even days, in new implementations.     | Create numbers series for the new company. Make sure all posted documents contain the last to digits of the current year.        |

# Set Up a Loaner Program
Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a loaner program, loan items to your customers, and track receipts when customers return the items. Additionally, you can add comments about loaners in one of two ways:  
  
* Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
* Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  

## To set up a loaner  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new loaner card. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner. Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to enter the next available loaner number.  
4. Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
5. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, choose the relevant unit of measure.

# Work with item attributes

When customers inquire about an item, either in correspondence or in an integrated web shop, they might ask or search according to characteristics, such as height and model year. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which can then be used when searching for items.

You can also assign item attributes to item categories, which then apply to the items that use the item categories. For more information, see [Categorize Item](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you attach pictures to items, the Image Analyzer extension can detect attributes in the image, and suggest the attributes so you can decide whether to assign them. The extension is ready to go.

# Create incoming document records directly from documents and entries

You can store external business documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by attaching the document files to the related incoming document records. If the document, such as a purchase invoice, didn't start its existence as an incoming document record, you can still create and connect an incoming document record to it later. You can also attach incoming document files to posted purchase and sales documents and to vendor, customer, and general ledger entries by using the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox in, for example, the **Posted Purchase Invoices** and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages.

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files. For more information, see [Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records](across-how-find-posted-documents-without-income-document-records.md).

The following procedures show how to attach a file to a vendor ledger entry or an existing purchase invoice that wasn't created from an incoming document record. Attaching a file to posted purchase or sales documents works in a similar way.

[!INCLUDE [incoming-doc-archived-doc](includes/incoming-doc-archived-doc.md)]

## Create and connect an incoming document record from a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Create and connect an incoming document record from a vendor ledger entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Remove a connection from an incoming document record to a posted document

You can remove file attachments from non-posted documents at any time by deleting the related incoming document record. If the document is posted, then you must first remove the connection from the incoming document record.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for an incoming document record connected to a posted document that you want to remove, and then choose the **Remove Reference to Record** action.

The connection to the posted document is removed. You can now proceed to connect another incoming document record to the posted document as described in this article.

# Set up resources for projects

To correctly manage resource activities, you must set up your resources and the related costs and prices. The project-related prices, discounts, and cost factor rules are set up on the project card. You can specify the costs and prices for individual resources, resource groups, or all available resources of the company.

You specify the default amount per hour when you set up a resource. The price and cost amounts apply when you use or sell resources in a project. For example, if you use a specific machine for five hours, the calculation is based on the amount per hour.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't purchase external resources for a specific project. We recommend that you use items of the type Service instead.

## To set up a resource

Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up a resource group

You can combine several resources in one resource group. All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources. You can also enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set capacity for a resource

To calculate how much time a resource can spend on projects, you must set their capacity. Capacity represents a resource's available time for a period on the work calendar. This setup is used when you fill in project planning lines that contain the resource. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant resource card, and then choose the **Resource Capacity** action.
3. On the **Resource Capacity** page, in the **View By** field, specify the length of the period, such as **Day**, that is shown on columns on the **Resource Capacity Matrix** FastTab.
4. For each resource on a line, specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available.
5. Alternatively, to detail the resource's capacity for a specific period, choose the **Set Capacity** action.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're setting capacity for a group of people who typically work the same hours, you can save a little time and ensure consistency by choosing a work hour template. For example, you might have one work hour template for full time technicians, and another for technicians that work part time. To learn more about work hour templates, go to [To set up work hour templates](service-how-setup-work-service-hours.md#to-set-up-work-hour-templates).

6. On the **Resource Capacity Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
7. Choose the **Update Capacity** action. The **Resource Capacity** page is updated with the entered capacity.
8. Close the page.

## To set up alternate resource costs

In addition to the cost specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate costs for each resource. For example, if you pay an employee a higher hourly rate for overtime, you can set up a resource cost for the overtime rate. The alternate cost that you set up for the resource overrides the cost on the resource card when you use the resource in the resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate costs for, and then choose the **Costs** action.  
3. On the **Resource Costs** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.  
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up resource costs that apply to all resources and resource groups, open the **Resource Costs** page and fill in the fields.

## To set up alternate resource prices

In addition to price specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate prices for each resource. These alternate prices can be conditional. They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific project or work type.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate prices for, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. On the **Resource Prices** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up.

## To adjust resource prices

If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job doesn't create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment takes effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on existing alternate prices

If you already set up alternate resource prices for some resources, you can use a batch job to set up multiple alternate resource prices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Price)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, the **Resource Price Changes** page shows the results of the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on standard prices

If you want to set up multiple alternate resource prices based on the standard prices on the resource cards, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Res.)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, open the **Resource Price Changes** page to see the results of the batch job.

### Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for resources at the same time, enable the **Enable multiple users to post resource ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# The QuickBooks Payroll file import extension
Use the QuickBooks Payroll File Import extension to import payroll transactions from QuickBooks to general ledger accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when you're transitioning from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or if you outsource your payroll but also want to keep track of it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Steps to import payroll data
The first step is for you, or maybe your accountant, to use the export features in QuickBooks to export the payroll data to an .IIF file. The second step is to open the **General Journals** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and use the **Import Payroll Transactions** action to import the file. During the import process, you map the general ledger accounts from QuickBooks to corresponding accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The final step is to post the payroll transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] according to the account mapping. 

For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

# Set Up Service Contracts
Before you can work with contracts, you must set up the following: 

* **Service contract groups**, which gather service contracts that are related in some way.
* **Service contract account groups**, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for service invoices created for service contracts. You assign these groups to service contracts.  
* **Contract templates** that define contract layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. When you create a contract quote, the fields automatically contain the contents of the template fields.

# Design Details: Rounding
Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

 When you use the average costing method, the rounding residual is calculated and recorded on a cumulative, entry-by-entry basis.  

 When you use a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual is calculated when the inventory increase has been fully applied, that is when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is equal to zero. A separate entry is then created for the rounding residual, and the posting date on this rounding entry is the posting date of the last invoiced value entry of the inventory increase.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how different rounding residuals are handled for the average costing method and non-Average costing method, respectively. In both cases, the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job has been run.  

 The following table shows the item ledger entries that the example is based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|4|  

 For an item using the Average costing method, the rounding residual (1/300) is calculated with the first decrease (entry number 2) and is carried forward to entry number 3. Therefore, entry number 3 is valued at –3.34.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.34|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  

 For an item using a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual (0.01) is calculated when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is zero. The rounding residual has a separate entry (number 5).  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.33|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  
|01-01-20|0|-0.01|1|5|

# Use item charges to account for extra trade costs

To ensure correct valuation, your inventory items must carry any added costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur when purchasing or selling the items. For purchases, the landed cost of a purchased item consists of the vendor's purchase price and all other direct item charges that can be assigned to individual receipts or return shipments. For sales, knowing the cost of shipping sold items can be as vital to your company as knowing the landed cost of purchased items.

In addition to recording the added cost in your inventory value, you can use item charges for the following tasks:

* Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network.
* Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes.
* Include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price.

Before you can assign item charges, you must set up item charge numbers for the different types of item charges. The numbers include to which G/L accounts to post costs related to sales, purchases, and inventory adjustments. An item charge number contains a combination of general product posting group, tax group code, VAT product posting group, and item charge. When you enter the item charge number on a purchase or sales document, the G/L account is retrieved. The account retrieved is selected based on the setup of the item charge number and the information on the document.

For both purchase and sales documents, you can assign an item charge in two ways:

* On the document that lists the items that the item charge relates to. Typically, you use this method for documents that aren't yet fully posted.
* On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relates to are listed.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can assign item charges to orders, invoices, and credit memos, for both sales and purchases. The following procedures describe how to work with item charges for a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other purchase and sales documents.

## Example

This video shows how to handle an extra shipping cost as part of inventory costing.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=35aa5336-39c8-46a2-b8eb-9ac925a17802]

## To set up item charge numbers

You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Charges**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Charges** page, choose the **New** action to create a new line.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item

If you know the item charge when you post a purchase invoice for the item, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new purchase invoice. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item.
4. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the units of the item charge that you're invoiced for.
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the item charge.
7. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    Do the following steps to perform the actual assignment. Until the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field is in red font.
8. On the **Lines** tab, choose the **Item Charge Assignment** action.

    The **Item Charge Assignment** page opens showing one line for each line of type Item on the purchase invoice. To assign the item charge to one or more invoice lines, you can use a function that assigns and distributes it for you or you can manually fill in the **Qty. to Assign** field. The following steps describe how to use the Suggest Item Charge Assignment function.

9. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.
10. If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item, choose one of the four distribution options.  

If the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field on the purchase invoice is zero.

The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice. When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice, the items' inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge.  

## To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item

If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt, follow this procedure.

1. Repeat steps 1 through 8 in [To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md#to-assign-an-item-charge-directly-to-the-purchase-invoice-for-the-item).
2. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.
3. On the **Purch. Receipt Lines** page, select the posted purchase receipt for the item that you want to assign the item charge to, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.

The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt. The item's inventory value updates with the cost of the item charge.

## Handle item charges for partial receipts

Let's explore an example of how to handle item charges for a partial receipt.

You have a purchase order with three lines:

* Two lines are for items.
* One line captures item charges allocated across the items by amount.

When the items are delivered, you find that one of the items is missing, so you can't mark that line as received. You can receive and post the purchase invoice for the second item only, and deal with the missing item later.

To handle the item cost for the partial receipt, on the **Item Charge Assignment** page, enter **0** in the **Quantity to Handle** field on the line for the missing item. Then, copy the value from the **Item Charge Qty. to Handle** field to the **Quantity to Invoice** field on the purchase order lines.

When you're ready to handle the item that was missing, update the **Quantity to Handle** field and post the order.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |
       |Matched Quantity | Specifies the quantity that is applied to the purchase order line. |
       |Proposal | Specifies the action that Copilot proposed for matching the purchase order lines. |
       |Learn Matching Rule | Specifies whether to create a matching rule for this proposal. If you select this checkbox, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates item references for items and text to account mappings for G/L accounts. |

    1. All fully suggested and matched lines are marked with green color. If there's an issue, for example, a different price but within the allowed price range, this line is marked with a yellow color. If there's any similarity between the description fields but the price difference is larger than allowed, this line is marked with a red color.
    1. If you aren't satisfied with some suggestions, you can delete them using the **Delete Line** action.  
    1. If you want to see proposal matchings, you can select the link in the **Proposal** column to open the **E-Document Match Details** page.
    1. On the **E-Document Match Details** page you can compare details from the **E-Documents** and **Purchase Order**, to be sure about the suggested matching before confirming it.
    1. After reviewing, close the page.

1. If you aren't satisfied with most of the suggestions, or if you don't want to use the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** feature, select **Discard it**. You can create the matches manually. To learn more, go to[manual matching](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md).  
1. If you want to keep suggestions, select **Keep it**.
1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] closes the Copilot prompt and lines on the **Purchase Order Matching** page are marked as green.  
1. You can continue to work as if you're doing a manual matching. For example, you can remove, create, or reset matches. If you don't want to change anything, just select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action and continue to work with the purchase order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select the **Match with Copilot** action from the **Purchase Order Matching** page again. If you do, you're asked whether you want to overwrite the existing matches.  

> [!NOTE]
> Price/Cost analysis and the check for available quantity are preprocessing activities.

# Set Up Standard Service Codes

When you perform typical service, you often have to create service documents that use service lines that contain similar information. To make it easy to create these lines, you can set up standard service codes that have a predefined set of service lines. When you choose the code on a service document, the lines are entered automatically. You can set up any number of standard service codes, and each code can have an unlimited number of service lines of different types, including item, resource, cost, or standard text linked to it. You create service lines of each standard service code on the **Standard Service Code** card. You then assign standard service codes to service item groups on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page. Later, when you create a service document, you can use the **Get Standard Service Codes** action to add service lines.  
  
> [!Tip]
> You can use the same concept to create lines on sales and purchase documents. For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).  
  
## To set up a standard service code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Service Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.  

## To assign a standard service code to a service item group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot's autofill feature assists you by automatically filling in editable blank fields on your page. Use autofill when creating or modifying a record. It suggests field values that you can choose to keep or discard. These suggestions are based on your Business Central data, such as frequently or recently used values, or they can be AI-generated based on option values, lookup values, or page context.

When Copilot generates suggestions, it only accesses the business data you can access. Copilot never saves suggestions automatically but presents them for you to decide what to keep. Copilot uses AI, and suggestions might not be correct.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

<!--Suggestions are based on Business Central that only you have access to.-->

## Prerequisites

Autofill is activated, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

### Where the autofill feature is available

The autofill feature is available on card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**, and only on editable fields in FastTabs on these pages, except for the fields listed in the following section.

> [!NOTE]  
> Autofill works on editable fields in FastTabs added to card and document pages by add-on apps (extensions).

### Where the autofill feature isn't available

The autofill feature isn't available on these types of pages:

- List pages like **Customers** and **Sales Orders**.
- Worksheet pages like the **Put-away Worksheet**.
- Setup pages, like **Company information** and **General Ledger Setup**, and assisted setup pages, like **Set up sales tax** and **Set up outgoing email**.
- Task dialogs.

The autofill feature isn't available on these fields regardless of the page type:

- Noneditable fields.
- Fields in the FactBox pane.
- Fields in rows and columns.
- Multiline text fields.
- Masked fields like passwords and secrets.
- Date and time fields.
- Toggle switches.
- Fields that uniquely identify a record like IDs and numbers from a series.
- Certain fields depending on your country/region. For example, Copilot can't make suggestions for address fields until web search powered by Bing is available in your country/region.

## Use autofill on fields

Open the page for editing, select a field, and then select the ![Shows the Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/copilot-star-unfilled.png) **Suggest a value for this field and related fields** icon or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. If the icon doesn't appear, autofill isn't available for the field, so try another field.

![Shows a card page with a Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/autofill-field.svg)

Suggestions are generated only for fields in the FastTab that you are on. When Copilot finds suggestions, they're automatically entered in the fields in italics along with the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon. Fields remain unchanged if suggestions aren't found or they don't support the autofill feature.

![Shows a suggested field with the accept and discard buttons.](media/autofill-suggested-value-field.svg)

When you hover over or select a field that includes a suggestion, the ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** and ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** buttons appear.

### Review suggestions

Review the suggestion for each field and take appropriate action. Suggestions aren't saved until you accept them.

- To learn more about a suggestion, select the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon next to the field, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. The details include the source of the suggestion, like the most frequently or recently used value. Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to give feedback.
- To keep a suggestion, select ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To reject a suggestion and keep the original value, select ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** or press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
- To change a suggestion, select **Change** in the details or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.

You can also use the **Keep all** button in the upper right corner of the page to accept or discard suggestions on all fields.

When you leave the page while there are unaccepted suggestions, Copilot asks you to accept or discard suggestions first.

<!--The first time you use Copilot, you're asked to accept the terms to continue.-->

## Autofill behavior with other data-entry features

Business Central offers many other features that reduce data entry, such as customer templates and business process settings that default values. On some pages, for example, when you specify the value for a field, Business Central validates and automatically sets related fields, like zip code and country. Unlike Copilot, these features don't use AI, and values are saved immediately.

When Copilot suggests a field value and you use any feature that saves a value to the same field, Copilot's suggestion is always discarded in favor of the value set by Business Central.

# Setting up inventory

Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

After you set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

## Questions about user access and licensing


<!-- 14 -->
### Do I need a Power BI Pro license to publish reports?

<!-- todo What does " or for every user that consults the published report" mean? fixed -->
No. A Pro license isn't needed to publish reports. The standard (free) Power BI license is enough. Learn more in [Power BI Licensing](admin-powerbi-setup.md#license).

<!-- 15 -->
### Is there anything I can't do with the free license?

You can't share reports or install the Business Central apps for Power BI. The free license allows you to create almost all variations of charts and reports.

<!-- 16 -->
### If someone shares a report with another person, then that person needs a Pro license to see the report. Are there plans to make this capability possible with the free license?

We don't have control over this requirement. Power BI sets this requirement. Learn more at [Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards).  

### How do guest users and delegated admins access my organization's data and reports?

There are some differences and limitations for external users, like guest users and delegated admins. For instance, external users typically have a Power BI license assigned by their own organization. When they sign in to Power BI or Power BI Desktop, they connect to their organization's tenant and shared workspaces by default.

To access your organization's data and shared workspaces or reports, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. From Power BI service, they can use the tenant switcher (preview) to connect. Power BI Desktop doesn't support connecting to a provider tenant's data source or service for creating and publishing reports. External users need to use the Power BI service to upload Power BI Desktop files.

<!--
1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).
1. In the upper-right corner, select the profile picture to open the account manager, and then select **Switch** next to **Tenant name**.
1. In the **Switch tenant (preview)** dialog, open the dropdown menu and choose the tenant.-->

## Questions about the Power BI Designer

<!-- 7 -->
### Does the connector work with pages exposed as web services?

Web services are an old technology and aren't recommended to use with Power BI. The Power BI connector supports both Business Central web services and API pages, but API pages generally have better performances and are more suited for making data available to other systems. Learn more at [Enable Power BI connector to work with Business Central APIs, instead of with web services only](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only).

### Can I build a Power BI report using the Sales Invoice Lines or Journal Lines APIs?

The most commonly used line records are available in the [Business Central APIs v2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/)). So you can use them to build reports in Power BI by selecting them in the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** connector. However, the **Lines** APIs are designed for use with specific filters only, and might not work in your scenario. You might get an error similar to "You must specify an ID or a Document ID to get the lines." To fix this problem, do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Instead of including the data source for the lines entity, add the parent data source. For example, add **Sales Invoice** instead of **Sales Invoice Lines**.
2. Select **Transform Data** in the Power BI Desktop action bar.
3. Select the query you just added, for example **Sales Invoices**.
4. To reduce the number of records loaded in your report, apply any needed filtering on the records.
5. Scroll vertically until you find a column named as the lines, for example **SalesInvoiceLines**.
6. Select the expand button in the header of the column, next to the column name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/saleinvoicelines.png" alt-text="Shows the SalesInvoiceLines column in Power BI Desktop.":::
<!-- 11 --> 
### Is it possible to choose which Business Central environment to get data from for Power BI, for example, like a sandbox or production environment? 

Yes. It can be easily chosen. When you connect to Business Central using the connector, you have to choose the environment and company name.

<!-- 6 --> 
### Can I merge data from several production environments of the same tenant?

Yes. In Power BI, just run the "get data" operation again and choose the environment you want.

<!-- 25 -->
### Which pages in Business Central have the Power BI Report part?  

Currently, there are a few selected pages that have a FactBox with a **Power BI Reports** part for displaying a report. 

On list pages, the **Power BI Reports** part is filtered to show reports that pertain to data in the list. Here's the list type pages that include the **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|22|Customer List|
|27|Vendor List|
|31|Item List|
|9305|Sales Order List|
|9308|Purchase Invoices|

Here are other pages that contain the larger, nonfiltered **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|1156|Company Detail|
|4013|Intelligent Cloud Insights |
|9006|Order Processor Role Center|
|9008|Whse. Basic Role Center|
|9010|Production Planner Role Center|
|9015|Job Project Manager RC|
|9016|Service Dispatcher Role Center|
|9022|Business Manager Role Center|
|9024|Security Admin Role Center|
|9026|Sales & Relationship Mgr. RC|
|9027|Accountant Role Center|

> [!TIP]
> We don't have plans to add it to all list pages at the moment. However, you can create a simple page extension that adds the **Power BI Reports** part in a FactBox. Learn more at [Adding Power BI Report Parts to Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-power-bi-report-parts) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

<!-- 5 -->
### Is there any way to filter a dataset from Business Central *before* I pull it into Power BI, instead of applying filters afterwards?

To filter larger datasets, the easiest way is to set a filter on your Power BI report by editing directly the Power Query formula. Most of the filters you set this way are passed on to Business Central through query folding. See [Incremental refresh for datasets](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-incremental-refresh).

There's currently no way of setting a filter for the web service data from within Business Central. If your application needs to set a filter from within Business Central, you must create a custom Business Central App for this purpose.

<!-- 10 -->
### From Power BI, besides using a query, is there another way to get data from Business Central tables that don't have an associated page? For example, like the *Item Attributes Value Mapping* table.

No. Not at this point.

<!-- 12 --> 
### Are published queries faster to use than published pages?

When it comes to web services, published queries are usually faster than equivalent published pages. The reason is that queries are optimized for reading data and don’t contain expensive triggers like OnAfterGetRecord.

Web services are based on pages or queries that are built for access from the web and not optimized for access from external services. Even though the Business Central connector still supports getting data from web services, we encourage you to use API pages instead of web services whenever possible.

<!-- 13 --> 
### Is there a way for an end user to create a web service with a column that's in a Business Central table, but not a page? Or does the developer have to create a custom query? 

There's currently no way of adding a new field to a web service. API pages offer full flexibility on the page structure, so a developer can create a new API page to meet this requirement. 

<!-- 28 --> 
### Can I connect Power BI to a read-only database server of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online? 

By default, the Power BI connector reads data from a read-only replica of the Business Central database, which is the case for all reports created after February 2022. This behavior causes your reports to refresh faster and has less impact on performance if you're using Business Central while a report is refreshing. We still recommend that you schedule your reports to refresh outside of normal working hours whenever possible.

If you have old reports based on Business Central data, they don't connect to the read-only database replica. In this case, consider recreating the query inside Power BI so that it uses the latest defaults.

### <a name="databasemods"></a>When I use the Power BI connector to connect to my custom [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API page, I get the error "Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." How can I fix it?

Reports that use Business Central data connect to a read-only replica of the Business Central database by default. In rare cases, this behavior might cause the error "Current connection intent is Read-Only.". This error typically happens because your custom API is making modifications to Business Central records while Power BI tries to get the data. In particular, it happens as part of the AL triggers: OnInit, OnOpenPage, OnFindRecord, OnNextRecord, OnAfterGetRecord, and OnAfterGetCurrRecord.

To fix this issue by forcing the Business Central connector to allow this behavior, see [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data - Fixing Problems](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

<!--
In general, we recommend avoiding any database modifications in API pages when they're opening or loading records, because they cause performance issues and might cause your report refresh to fail. In some cases, you might still need to make a database modification when your custom API page opens or loads records. You can force the Business Central connector to allow this behavior. Do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
2. In the ribbon, select **Get Data** > **Online Services**.
3. In the **Online Services** pane, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
4. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
5. In the preview pane on the right, you'll see the following error:

   *Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".*

6.	Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do.
7. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
8.	Replace the following line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

   with the line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = false]),
   ```

9.	Select **Done**.
10. Select **Close & Apply** from the ribbon to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

-->
### <a name="perms"></a>How do I change or clear the user account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?

In Power BI Desktop, do the following steps:

1. In the File menu, select **Options and settings** > **Data source settings**.
2. Select **Dynamics Business Central** from the list, then select **Clear permissions** > **Delete**.

Then next time you connect to Business Central to get data, you'll be asked to sign in.


<!-- ## [Performance](#tab/performance) -->
## Questions about data refresh performance

<!-- 17 -->

### Is it faster to get data using API pages than using web services?

Yes. Our tests indicate that API pages are up to 25% more performant than web services.

<!-- 18 -->
### Are there plans to have a mirror on the Azure SQL Database instance, which I can connect to directly?

No. Not at this point. You can only communicate with Business Central through APIs.

<!-- 19 -->
### Loading data from Business Central web services seems slow. Is there any way to get data directly from the SQL database table?

No. Direct access to the database isn't possible, but switching to API pages helps greatly.

## Troubleshooting questions

### My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

<!-- ## [Advanced](#tab/advanced) -->
## Advanced questions
<!-- 1 -->

### Are there plans for the Power BI connector to support the incremental refresh features in the Power BI Service?

Yes. It's on our roadmap.

<!-- 2 -->
### If a Business Central on-premises solution doesn't have internet access, can I still use Power BI?
<!-- todo: please explain this one-->

Yes. In this case, you use Power BI Desktop locally and connect to the Business Central on-premises. Once connected, can create and view reports, but you just can't publish them to the Power BI Service. 
<!-- 20 -->
### Are there any plans to make it possible to replicate Business Central online databases so they're accessible for read-only SQL queries? This capability would support incremental refresh and be a lot faster than APIs or web services.

<!-- todo: what does "BC-Saas-DB-replicated DB accessible" mean? fixe-->
Yes. We have this feature on our long-term roadmap. 

<!-- 21 -->
### If I use Azure Data Factory to get data from Business Central and consume it on Power BI, does that help in increase in performance? 

Yes. This advanced scenario helps Business Central stay performant, because the data access would be done via the Azure Data Factory.

<!-- 22 -->
### Are there any plans to support Power BI deployment pipelines or a way to build deployment pipelines for PBI reports, similar to extensions? Or maybe even a simple API in the Business Admin Center? 

We're looking into this feature. Power BI offers rich APIs to control report deployments. Learn more at [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview).

### When I get data from Business Central to use in my Power BI reports, I see some values like "_x0020_". What are these values?

Some API pages, including most API v2.0 pages, have fields based on [AL Enum objects](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extensible-enums). Fields based on AL enum objects must have names that are consistent and always the same, so that filters on the report always work&mdash;no matter the language or operating system you're using. For this reason, the fields based on AL enums aren't translated and are encoded to avoid any special character, including the space. In particular, whenever there's an empty option in the AL Enum object, it's encoded to "_x0020_". You can always apply a transformation to your data on Power BI if you want to display some different value for these fields, for example "Empty".

# Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files.

## To find posted documents without incoming document records

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a G/L account for whose general ledger entries you want to see posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records, and then choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** action.
3. Alternatively, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. On the **General Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Documents** action.

The **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page opens showing posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records represented by general ledger entries on the G/L account that you opened the page for. The page can show a maximum of 1000 lines. By default, the **Date Filter** field therefore contains a filter that limits the lines to entries with posting dates from the beginning of the accounting period to the work date.

## To connect found documents to existing incoming document records

1. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, select the line for a posted document that you want to connect to an existing incoming document record, and then choose the **Select Incoming Document** action.
2. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the incoming document record that you want to connect to posted document found, and then choose the **OK** button.
3. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, the selected incoming document record is now connected to the posted document, as you can see in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

If a relevant incoming document record doesn't exist on the **Incoming Documents** page, then you can create it. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

# Settle purchase invoices promptly

If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can post the payment when you post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, check, or bank transfer, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice. For more information, see [Defining Payment Methods](finance-payment-methods.md).  

## To settle purchase invoices promptly

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must contact a Microsoft partner who can add the fields through code.  
>
> This customization is only required if you do not specify balancing accounts on the payment methods as describe above.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

# Allocate recurring costs and income

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several accounts when you post the journal. To learn more about recurring general journals, go to [Work with recurring journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).

The following allocation methods are available:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features work with recurring general journals and in fixed asset journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following procedures describe how to prepare to allocate costs in a recurring general journal by defining allocation keys. When allocation keys are defined, you complete and post the journal like any other recurring general journal. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Allocation Accounts** aren't supported in recurring journals. While the **Allocation Account** option is available in the **Account Type** field on the lines of the journal, this option isn't supported. Instead, use the allocations feature as described in this article.
>
> If you defined allocation accounts in a previous version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], update the setup to use allocations.

## To set up allocation keys

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be a quantity, percentage, or amount.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you're done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you're allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that is already set up

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose the **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose **OK**.

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning** toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Review amounts in general ledger accounts

You might have general ledger accounts that you frequently keep an eye on. Or you might want to speed up the review process at the end of the month. For help with keeping track of what you've done, and to speed up reviews, use the **Review Entries** action on the **Chart of Accounts** or the **G/L Account Card** page for each account. 

## Set up accounts for reviews

On the **G/L Account Card** page for each account, specify how to allow reviews in the **Review Policy** field.

|Review Policy  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|None     | You can't mark entries for the account as reviewed. For example, use this option for accounts such as payables, receivables, and bank accounts where there are other ways to review their amounts.        |
|Allow Review     | You don't have to include entries in a review, and the amounts of the debit and credit entries don't have to balance. You remove a review, for example, if you've made a mistake.        |
|Allow Review and Match Balance     | The total amounts of the debit and credit entries in the review must match. The **Debit** and **Credit** fields show those amounts, and the **Balance** field shows the total. This setting also lets you remove a review. When you remove a review from one or more entries, the debit and credit entries must still balance.        |

## Mark entries as reviewed

Choose the entries you've reviewed, and then use the **Set selected as reviewed** action. Each time you mark one or more entries as reviewed the entries are given the same number in the **Reviewed Identifier** column. The review identifier is a handy way to keep track of the entries that were reviewed at the same time. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also records the user who did the review, and when they did it.

If you mark entries as reviewed, but regret doing so, use the **Set selected as not reviewed** action.

* If the Review allowed policy is assigned to the account, the action resets the reviewed identifier to 0 and removes the person and date and time of the review. 
* If the Review allowed and match balance policy is assigned, the credit and debit must still balance. For example, if one of the entries in a review is a mistake, you can choose another entry with the correct value. The replacement entry doesn't have to have the same reviewed identifier.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to choose multiple entries is to hold down Ctrl or Shift while you choose the entries. *Ctrl* lets you selects specific entries, and *Shift* selects all entries between the first and last entries you select.

## Review accounts that have old entries

You might have entries from past periods that you've already reviewed or just don't need a review. You just want to start reviewing entries from, for example, the beginning of the year or accounting period. You can leave the entries as is. However, if you want to analyze data in Excel or by using Analysis Mode, mark the entries as reviewed. To learn more about analyzing entries, go to [Analyze entries](#analyze-entries). To mark the entries as reviewed, add a filter on the Filter pane to display only those entries, and then choose the **Mark selected entries as reviewed** action.

## Filter entries

To get a clearer picture, there are several ways to filter entries on the **Review G/L Entries** page.

* Use the **Show Reviewed Entries** and **Hide Reviewed Entries** actions to show only the entries you have or haven't reviewed. To clear the filters, use the **Show all entries** action.
* Use the Filter pane. For example, you might filter by account number or, if you have older entries and want to mark them all as reviewed, by a posting date.

## Analyze entries

There are a couple of ways to analyze the general ledger entries you've reviewed.

* Turn on Analysis Mode, for example, to group entries according to their reviewed identifier. To learn more about Analysis Mode, go to [Analyze List Page Data Using Analysis Mode](analysis-mode.md).
* Export the entries to Excel.

# Sales

You create a sales invoice or sales order to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.

You must use sales orders if your sales process requires you to ship parts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't available right away. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use sales orders. In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. With sales orders, you can also use the order promising functionality to communicate certain delivery dates to your customers.  

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice or sales order when you agree on the sale. After the customer confirms the agreement, you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed.

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the customer pays it. For example, to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo or a sales return order to reverse the sale.

Good sales and marketing practices are all about how to make the best decisions at the right time. Marketing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a precise and timely overview of your contact information so you can serve your prospective customers more efficiently and increase customer satisfaction. Learn more at [Relationship Management](marketing-relationship-management.md).

If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities. For example, to process orders, manage inventory, and do your finances. Learn more at [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

In business environments where the customer must pay before products are delivered, such as in retail, you must wait for the receipt of payment before you deliver the products. In most cases, you process incoming payments some weeks after delivery by applying the payments to their related posted, unpaid sales invoices. Learn more at [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Sales documents can be sent as PDF files attached to email. The email body contains an extract of the sales document, such as products, total amount, and a link to the PayPal site. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

For all sales processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow. For example, an approval workflow can require that a manager approves large sales to certain customers. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick

For locations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can break larger units of measure into smaller units of measure when it creates warehouse instructions for source documents, production orders, or internal picks and put-aways. To breakbulk can also mean gathering items in smaller units of measure to equal the quantity of a larger unit of measure on a source document or production order.

## Breakbulk in picks  

If you want to store items in several different units of measure in a location and allow them to be automatically combined in the picking process, turn on the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the Location Card page. Afterward, to fulfill a task [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will look for an item in the same unit of measure. If it doesn't find one, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed.  

If only smaller units of measure are available, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order. In effect, it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking.  

## Breakbulk in put-aways  

In warehouse put-aways, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure. For example, it might suggest pieces even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure.  

## Breakbulk in movements  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can also breakbulk in replenishment movements if the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** page is turned on.  

You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away, pick, or movement instructions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field on the warehouse instruction header, application will hide the breakbulk lines whenever the larger unit of measure is going to be completely used. For example, if a pallet is 12 pieces and you'll use all 12 pieces, the pick will then direct you to take 1 pallet and place 12 pieces. However, if you must pick only 9 pieces the breakbulk lines aren't hidden, even if you've selected the **Breakbulk Filter** field. The lines aren't hidden because you must put the remaining three pieces somewhere in the warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse, also in connection with breakbulk, you should try to:  
>
> - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes.  
> - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure.

# Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment

To let people work in their preferred language, the user interface (UI) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is translated by apps that Microsoft provides, or by language apps that our partners provide on AppSource. Administrators install the language apps in their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Afterward, on the **My Settings** page, people can choose the language in which they want to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Languages** page lists all languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. However, to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a selected language, the language app must be installed in the environment. If someone chooses a language that a language app isn't installed for, they might be confused when the UI doesn't change.

To avoid confusion and make it easier for people to select a language they can use, administrators can use the **Allowed Languages** page to list the languages that they installed language apps for. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the list of languages on the **My Settings** page to show only the allowed languages.

## Create a list of allowed languages

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allowed Languages**, and choose the related link.
1. In the **Language ID** field, choose the language to allow.
1. Repeat step 2 for each language that you installed a language app for.

# Report and document layouts overview

A report layout controls content and format of the report. For example, the data fields in the report dataset that appear on the report, how they're arranged, the text style, images, and so on. From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can change which layout is used on a report, create new layout, or modify the existing layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations that you send to customers as PDF files.

You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Introduction

A report layout sets up the following things:

* The label and data fields to include from the dataset of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report.
* The text format, such as font type, size, and color.
* The company logo and its position.
* General page settings, such as margins and background images.

You can set up multiple layouts for a report, and then switch between them to suit different reporting needs.

<!--You can use one of the built-in report layouts or you can create custom report layouts and assign them to your reports as needed. Learn more in [Create a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).-->

There are two important aspects of report layouts that influence how you work with them:

* The **Layout Type** indicates the kind of file that the layout is based on.
* The **Layout Source** indicates the origin of the layout.

## Layout types

There are four types of layouts that you can use for reports:

* Word
* RDLC
* Excel
* External

### Word

Word layouts are based on Word documents (.docx file type). Word layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Microsoft Word. A Word layout determines the report's content - controlling how that content elements are arranged and how they look. A Word layout document typically uses tables to arrange content, where the cells can contain data fields, text, or pictures.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout-overview.png)](media/word-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

<!--![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/nav_wordreportlayout_edit_in_word_example.png) -->

Learn more in [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).

### Excel

Excel layouts are based on Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx file type). They let you create reports by using familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data with tools like formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and more.

[![Shows the an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)](media/excel-layout-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

### RDLC

RDLC layouts are based on client report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). These layouts are created and modified by using SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft RDLC Report Designer. The design concept for RDLC layouts is similar to Word layouts, where the layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word layouts.

[![Shows the an example of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png)](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md).

### External

An external layout type refers to an advanced type designed for specific reports. The reports and the layouts themselves are typically provided by partners, not Microsoft. The actual file type of the layout varies depending on the provider.

Learn more in [Developing a custom report render](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-custom-render).

## Layout sources

In addition to the type, layouts are further divided into three categories, based on their source or origin.

* Extension layouts

   Extension layouts are layouts that are part of an extension installed in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. These layouts are typically standard layouts provided by Microsoft, for example, in the base application. Or, they could be layouts that are included in extensions from other software providers. You can identify extension layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column shows the extension name and publisher.

* User-defined layouts

   The other source of layouts is the people who use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. People with the right permissions can add new layouts in various ways. For example, you could start from an existing extension layout or a user-defined layout. You can identify user-defined layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column is blank.

   Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

* Custom layouts (obsolete)

  Custom layouts are also layouts that users create. The difference is that these layouts are created from the now obsolete **Custom Report Layouts** page, and they can only be Word and RDLC type. Although you can still create custom layouts, they're being phased out in favor of user-defined layouts.

  Learn more in [(Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

Learn more about which type is best for you in [Decide what type of layout you want](ui-get-started-layouts.md#decide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing to remember is that you can't modify extension layouts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. For example, you can't change the layout name or type, or upload and replace it with another version. If you try, an error message displays. You can create a user-defined or custom layout based on the extension layout instead.

<!--
### Built-in and custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in layouts. Built-in layouts are predefined layouts that are designed for specific reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reports will have a built-in layout as either an RDLC report layout, Word report layout, or in some cases both. You can’t modify a built-in report layout from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you use them as a starting point for building your own custom report layouts.

Custom layouts are report layouts that you design to change the appearance of a report. You typically create a custom layout based on a built-in layout, but you can create them from scratch or from a copy of an existing custom layout. Custom layouts enable you to have multiple layouts for the same report, which you switch among as needed. For example, you can have different layouts for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, or you can have different layouts for the same company for specific occasions or events, like a special campaign or holiday season.

Deciding on whether to use a Word, Excel, or RDLC layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look and your knowledge of tools for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This means that the same report might look different when using the Word report layout compared to the RDLC report layout.

* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC report layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Word and especially Excel layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC report layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

For information about how to switch the layout currently used on a report, see [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md).

## View report layout lifecycle telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send data to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure about the actions users take on report layouts, like adding, modifying, deleting, and more. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. Learn more in the following articles of the Developer and IT Pro help:

* [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry - Enable telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Actual (Total Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-total-price)
- [**Billable (Invoiced Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#billable-invoiced-price)
- [**Realization %**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-)
- [**Realization Variance**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-variance)

# Create service items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "service item" refers to equipment or items that require service. When you create a service order, you specify the items that need service. In the order, you can link a service item to an item in inventory or a service item group.

When you receive an item that needs service, you can register it as a service item. There are several ways to do so. For example, you can create a service item on the **Service Items** page, or as part of another process, such as when working with a service order.

## To create a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To create service items within a service order

When you receive items for service that you want to register as service items, you can create them as service items in the **Service Order** or **Service Quote** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Create Service Item** action.  

    A number is assigned to the service item and a service item card is created. The **Service Item No.** field is filled in with the number of the new service item.

## To create a service item when shipping items

When you ship items by posting either sales orders or sales invoices, the shipped items are automatically registered as service items if the following condition is met. The items must belong to a service item group with the **Create Service Item** check box selected. If the items have serial numbers registered in the Item Tracking Lines page, this information is copied automatically to the **Serial No.** field on the service item card when creating service items.  

The following procedure shows how to create service items when you ship items on sales orders.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.  
3. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Print** action.  
4. Choose the **Ship** or **Ship and Invoice** action.  
5. The service items are automatically created for the items on the order, provided these belong to a service item group that you have set up to create service items. If you registered specific serial numbers on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, they will be assigned to these service items.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an item is a BOM and you have exploded the BOM, the exploded BOM items are processed in the same way as regular items. Service items are created based on the service items group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition. Additionally, if a service item is created for an exploded BOM item that is made up of other BOM components, these items are created as service item components for the exploded BOM service item.  
>
> If an item is a BOM and you have not exploded the BOM, a service item is created for it based on the service item group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition.  

## To insert a starting fee for a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action.
3. Choose the service line, and then choose **Actions**, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Starting Fee** action.  

    A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the selected service item.

## Block items, item variants, or specific service items

You can prevent items, item variants, or service items from being used in service management transactions, such as service contracts, service orders, and service invoices. This can be useful if you want to restrict the availability of some items or service items for service purposes, for example, due to discontinued support, limited stock, or contractual agreements.

To block an item or an item variant from being used in service management transactions, turn on the **Service Blocked** toggle on the **Item Card**, **Item Variants**, and **Item Variant Card** page. You can also set this field on the **Item Template** page, and it will be copied to the items created from that template.

When an item or an item variant is service blocked, it isn't available for selection on the following pages:

- Service Line (except for service credit memos, where you'll see a notification that the item or variant is blocked, but allowed on this type of document)
- Service Item
- Service Contract Line
- Standard Service Line

If you manually enter an item number or variant that's blocked, you'll get an error message that states, "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items or item variants, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** or **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page.
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, **Create Contract Service Orders** or **Create Contract Invoices**  on the **Service Contract** page.
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** page.
- **Release to Ship** or **Post** on the **Service Order** page.
- **Post** in the **Service Invoice** page.

### Block a service item

To block a service item from being used in service management transactions, on the **Service Item Card** page, in the **Blocked** field, choose one of the following options:

- **Service Contract**: Block the service item from being used in service contracts and service contract quotes, but not in service orders or other service documents.
- **All**: Block the service item from being used in any service management transaction, including service contracts, service orders, and other service documents.

When a service item is blocked, you can't select it on the following pages:

- Service Contract Line (if blocked for service contract, or all)
- Service Item Line (except for service credit memos, if blocked for all)

If you manually enter a service item number for a blocked service item, an error message displays "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** and **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, or **Change Customer** on the **Service Contract** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** (if blocked for all).
- **Release to Ship**, **Post** on the **Service Order** (if blocked for all. If service order documents contain multiple service items, and some are blocked and others are not, you can release and post non-blocked lines. Consider whether to turn on the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle on the **Service Management Setup** page).
- **Post** on the **Service Invoice** page (if blocked for all).

You can also view the blocked service items by applying a filter to the following reports:

- Service Items (report 5935)
- Service Items Out of Warranty (report 5937)
- Service Profit (Service Items) (report 5938)

### Data upgrade

This feature doesn't require additional setup. However, if you upgrade your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], be aware of the following:

- If you have items, item variants, or item templates where the **Sales Blocked** toggle is turned on, the **Service Blocked** field is also turned on for those records during upgrade. This ensures that the existing sales blocked logic also applies to service management transactions.
- Data upgrades only if you have at least one service item in your company, which means you're using the service management functionality and need the data upgrade. If you don't have service items, the data upgrade is skipped and the **Service Blocked** toggle is turned off by default for all items, item variants, and item templates.

# Record sustainability entries

You can manually record greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or water and waste intensity in the sustainability ledger by using sustainability journals. You can also use purchase documents or general journals to record GHG emissions.  

<!--> [!NOTE]
> Posting water and waste intensity and using general journals for posting emissions will be enabled starting *2025 release wave 1*.  -->

## Sustainability journals

Sustainability journals are designed to track and record sustainability-related activities by using the same user experience as other journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually enter emissions and water or waste intensity in a journal. Alternatively, if you don't have the information, you can use built-in formulas to accurately calculate emissions or water or waste intensity based on parameters that correspond to various types of sources and accounts.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in that journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where it can't be changed. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries.

### Use journal templates and batches

By default, there are standard and recurring sustainability journal templates.

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. To do so, select the **Batches** action on the **Sustainability Journal Templates** page, and then create the new **Sustainability Journal Batch** on the new page. For example, you can define your own journal batch for each emission scope by using the **Emission Scope** option and then selecting among the four existing scopes or **Water/Waste** option. For each batch, you can add or change the **Source Code** and **Reason Code** values.

> [!TIP]
> If you have many lines, you can help reduce the risk of mistakes by having one journal batch for each emission type. Alternatively, you can use the common batch for all emission types.

### Validate sustainability journals

On the **Sustainability Setup** page, you can turn on a background check to help prevent posting delays. If any mistakes occur while you work in the sustainability journal, the validation notifies you and prevents you from posting the journal.

When you enable the validation, the **Journal Check** FactBox shows issues on the current line and in the whole batch. Validation occurs when you load a journal batch and when you select another journal line. The **Issues Total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found. You can select the tile to open an overview of the issues.

### Work with sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you plan to post in the same batch.
3. For internal documents, you can leave the **Document Type** field blank. If not, you can select **Invoice**, **Credit Memo**, or **GHG Credit**.  
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use a batch where the emission scope is configured, the **Emission Scope** value in the sustainability account must equal the **Emission Scope** value in the batch.

5. You can either manually fill in the emission amounts or use formulas.

    - If you have accurate information about gas emission or water or waste intensity and want to post it (that is, if you have the information on the received invoice, or some other measured model), select the **Manual Input** field to indicate that you manually enter the amounts. In this case, you can't enter your data directly in the **Fuel/Electricity**, **Distance**, **Custom Amount**, **Installation Multiplier**, and **Time Factor** fields because they become uneditable. However, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields remain editable, and you can enter your data directly in them.
    - If you don't have accurate knowledge of the gas emission or water or waste intensity and must calculate it, don't select the **Manual Input** field. In this case, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields become uneditable. However, you can enter your calculation details based on the formula that you're using. To learn more about the formulas that are defined in the **sustainability account category**, go to [Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger](finance-sustainability-accounts-ledger.md#account-categories).  

6. To post the journal, select the **Post** action. When you post in a sustainability journal, entries are generated in the sustainability ledger.

> [!NOTE]
> For water and waste intensity calculation, you can only use a formula with the **Custom Amount** that's multiplied with the emission factor from the **Sustainability Account Subcategory**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your formula is based on the **Calculate from General Ledger** option in the sustainability account category, you must use the **Collect Amount from G/L Entries** action before you post the journal. The action calculates emissions based on this data source. Additionally, if you made changes to the emission factors after the journal lines were filled in, you must select the **Recalculate** action to get the correct amount in the journal.

### Changing account subcategories in the journal line  

You can have more than one **Account Subcategory** related to one **Sustainability Account**, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting. To use a different subcategory for each account, you can easily change this value on the **Sustainability Journal** line, but you can only select subcategories that are already associated with the specific account and account category.

> [!TIP]
> Here's an example. You want to use one account for different types of cars, but the cars have different emission factors. You can set up one account and create an account subcategory for each emission factor. When you work in your sustainability journal, you can easily change your account subcategory based on the car type you choose to use for recording emissions.

### Recurring journals

A recurring journal is a sustainability journal that has specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. Examples include sustainability transactions such as electricity or heat, or other similar transactions. You can use recurring journals to post fixed and variable amounts.

When you use a recurring journal, you create the entries that you regularly post only one time. Information such as the accounts, dimensions, and dimension values remain in the journal after posting. Each time that you post, you can make any changes that are needed.

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how the amount on the journal line is handled after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time that you post the line, you can select the **F Fixed** option to let the amount remain after posting. If you use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time that you post, you can select the **V Variable** option to delete the amount after posting.

The **Recurring Frequency** field is also important and must be set. It's a date formula field that determines how often the entry on the journal line is posted. Learn more in [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

The **Expiration Date** field determines the date when the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after that date. The advantage of using the **Expiration Date** field is that the line isn't immediately deleted from the journal. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future. If the field is blank, the line is posted every time, until you delete it from the journal.

## Purchase documents  

To enable recording of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in any purchase-related documents, you must select the **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** on the **Sustainability Setup** page. 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   - Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want the invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   - Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want the order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
2. Populate the header and lines based on the instructions in [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. If you have information about emissions on your invoice from the vendor, choose the appropriate **Sustainability Account No.** in the document lines and add emission values using one of the following fields (based on what you want to track and emissions you have on your physical invoice): **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, or **Emission N2O**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values you enter in the emission fields are fixed amounts per line. They aren't multiplied with the **Quantity** field. You can use **Sustainability Account No.** only when the **Type** field (**Option Values**) is **Item** or **G/L Account**. You can't use **Resource** or **Charge (Item)** **Option Values**. 

4. If you want to review total emissions before posting, you can open the statistics page and find the total posted emissions and emissions for posting per document (any purchase-related documents) on the **Sustainability** FastTab.
5. Post the documents and open a new **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
6. Select the **Find Entries** action. You have a **Sustainability Ledger Entry** as one of the related entries on the **Find entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post the document, for each of the purchase lines where you have **Sustainability Account No.**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an independent **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **Invoice** as a **Document Type** and the same **Document No.**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create and post a **Purchase Credit Memo** manually, or by using the **Cancel**, **Correct**, or **Create Corrective Credit Memo** actions, in which case [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the existing values from the posted invoice.  

## General journals

You can use general journals to post gas emissions together with the financial amounts. This option is used if you want to post your incoming invoices using journals and not documents. In this situation, you can [use general journals](ui-work-general-journals.md) as usual, but before posting journals, you should add emissions. There isn't an option to use formulas in general journals. After you select the right **Sustainability Account No.** for the journal line, you can add only total emission amounts in the **Total Emission CO2**, **Total Emission CH4**, or **Total Emission N2O** fields. After you post, lines are recorded in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** and if you included a carbon equivalent calculation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select the **Sustainability Account No.** in the journal line only if **Document Type** for this line is **Invoice** or **Credit Memo**. For all other options, you can't select the **Sustainability Account No.** and post emissions.

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# Set Up Shipment Methods

Shipment methods often depend on the items, the customers, and the vendors. For example, if the customer lives on an island, they can choose to have items always shipped by air or always by sea. Some customers may require next day delivery. Some may want to pick up the order. On the customer and vendor cards, you can specify what sort of delivery is desired.

You set up the description and code for each shipment method on the **Shipment Methods** page. For example, you can set up the code FOB, and enter Free on Board in the **Description** field. You can then enter the code in **Shipment Method Code** fields elsewhere in the system, such as on a customer card. Then when you create new orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on, the system will enter the description represented by the code. You can change it on the document as needed.

## To set up a shipment method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Shipment Methods** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, specify a code and description for the shipment method.

> [!TIP]
> If you use Incoterms, set up shipment methods to represent the relevant Incoterms rules.

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. You can't post usage or sales for the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Enter external document numbers

You can enter external document numbers for customers and vendors in all sales and purchase orders, invoices, and credit memos. You can use these numbers to search for posted sales and purchase lines later.  

> [!NOTE]
> Specify the document number that your customer or vendor has specified. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not check if these external document numbers are unique or duplicates.

The following procedure explains how to specify an external document number on a sales order, but similar steps apply to other sales and purchase documents.

## To enter external document numbers in a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant sales order, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the invoice number.

# Use OCR to turn PDF and image files into electronic documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service sends the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo, or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service interprets characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It might not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it might misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. To learn more, go to [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

A dedicated job queue entry processes the traffic of files to and from the OCR service. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. To learn more, go to [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record is created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. To learn more, go to [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you take a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. To learn more, go to [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option gets any documents that the OCR service completed.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, the **OCR Status** field contains **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, do the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. To learn more, go to [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document displays, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, go to the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or nonposted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines are filled in only if you mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references for document lines of the type Item. To learn more, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. To learn more, go to [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information is added in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], show on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. To learn more, go to [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line is for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account to add on the resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account to insert on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields with incoming documents. They're used for automatic payment reconciliation only. To learn more, go to [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It might not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it might misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page update with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Define Retention Policies

This article describes how administrators can define retention policies to specify how often to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries can make it easier to work with the more relevant data. Policies can delete data based on an expiration date, or you can add filters to include only certain expired data.

## Required setups and permissions

Before you can create retention policies, you must set up the tables to include and the periods of time to keep data.

|Setup  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Allowed Tables**     |We provide a list of tables that you can include in retention policies. If you want to add tables from an extension to a retention policy, a developer must add their tables to the list. To learn more, go to [Include your extension in a retention policy](admin-data-retention-policies.md#include-your-extension-in-a-retention-policy-requires-help-from-a-developer).          |
|**Retention Periods**     |Specify periods of time for which to keep data in the tables in a policy. The periods determine how often data is deleted.         |

Additionally, you must have the **SUPER** user permissions or the **Retention Policy Setup** permission set. Users who have the Retention Policy Setup permission set can define retention policies for tables. That's true, even if they don't have Read and Delete permissions for the tables. The job queue entry must run as a user with permissions to read and delete the data. Don't grant the Retention Policy Setup permission set to users who shouldn't be allowed to delete data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and you want to try out retention policies in the the Cronus demonstration database, there are a few things you need to do. The demonstration company doesn't contain tables that you can use with retention policies, so you need to add them. To do that, create a new, blank company in the demonstration database. In the new company, import the RapidStart configuration package for your country/region that corresponds to the standard NAV17.0.W1.ENU.STANDARD.rapidstart package. The setup data for retention policies will be available in the new company.

### Create retention periods

Retention periods can be as long or as short as you want. To create retention periods, on the **Retention Policies** page, use the **Retention Period** action. The periods you define are available for all policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For compliance reasons, we have defined a minimum retention period for some tables. If you set a retention period that's shorter than minimum required, a message displays the mandatory period.

### Set up a retention policy

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Retention Policies**, and choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new retention policy. 
3. In the **Table ID** field, choose the table that you want to include in the policy.
4. In the **Retention Period** field, specify the length of time for which to keep the data in the table.
5. Optional: You can apply the policy to specific data in a table, rather than all records, by filtering the data for each line. The policy will apply only to the records that the filters return. To specify the filter criteria, turn off the **Apply to all records** toggle. The **Record Retention Policy** FastTab displays, where you can set filter criteria. To learn more about how filters work, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each line has its own retention period. If you specify different retention periods for the same data, the longest period is used. Also, some tables contain filters that you can't change or remove. To help you identify these filters, they appear in a lighter color font.

#### Video guidance

This video provides an example of how to set up a retention policy.

>[!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=511928c9-f956-45f6-8748-0c96f7ff0d33]

## Apply retention policies

You can use a job queue entry to apply retention policies to delete data automatically, or you can manually apply policies.

To apply a retention policy automatically, just create and enable a policy. When you enable a policy,, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a job queue entry that applies the it according to its retention period. All retention policies will use the same job queue entry. By default, the job queue entry applies the policy every day at 0200. You can change the default, but if you do we recommend that it runs outside business hours. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

You can manually apply a policy by using the **Apply Manually** action on the **Retention Policies** page. If you want to always apply a policy manually, turn on the **Manual** toggle. The job queue entry will disregard the policy when it runs.

## View retention policy log entries

You can view activity related to retention policies in the **Retention Policy Log** page. For example, entries are created when a policy is applied, or if errors occurred.

## Include your extension in a retention policy (requires help from a developer)

By default, retention policies cover only [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the list we provide. You can remove default tables from the list, and you can add tables that you own. That is, you can't add a table that you did not create yourself. For example, you can't add other tables from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from an extension that you have purchased.

To add your tables to the list of allowed tables, a developer must add some code. For example, to the installer codeunit for the extension (a codeunit with the *install* subtype).

When a developer adds a table, they can specify mandatory and default filters. Mandatory filters can't be removed or modified later when you add tables to define a retention policy. The default filters are just suggestions.

The following are examples of how to add a table to the list of allowed tables with, and without, mandatory or default filters. For a more complex example, go to codeunit 3999 "Reten. Pol. Install - BaseApp".

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
    begin
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Retention Policy Log Entry");
    end;
```

The following example includes a mandatory filter.

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        ChangeLogEntry: Record "Change Log Entry";
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
        RetentionPeriod: Enum "Retention Period Enum";
        RecRef: RecordRef;
        TableFilters: JsonArray;
        Enabled: Boolean;
        Mandatory: Boolean;
    begin
        ChangeLogEntry.Reset();
        ChangeLogEntry.SetFilter("Field Log Entry Feature", '%1|%2', ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::"Monitor Sensitive Fields", ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::All);
        RecRef.GetTable(ChangeLogEntry);
        Enabled := true;
        Mandatory := true;
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddTableFilterToJsonArray(TableFilters, RetentionPeriod::"28 Days", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), Enabled, Mandatory, RecRef);
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Change Log Entry", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), TableFilters);
    end;
```

After a developer has added tables to the list, an administrator can include them in a retention policy.

# Register Employees

To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first add each employee by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page.

## Adding new employees

You can add new employees manually, by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a templates for different types of employee profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new employees, and helps ensure that the information is correct each time. If you create templates for more than one type of employee, you can choose the template to use when you add an employee. If you create only one template it will be used for all new employees. After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected employees. To create a template, you fill in the information that you want to reuse on the Employee Card page, and then save it as a template.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Employee Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping employee records up-to-date can simplify personnel-related tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the Employee Card page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab on the **Employee Card** page. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

## To set up an employee

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Employee Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To insert a picture of an employee

If you have a picture of an employee, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. In the **Employee Picture** FactBox, choose the drop-down button, and then choose **Import**.
4. On the **Select a picture to upload** page, then do one of the following steps to upload the picture file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The picture is inserted in the **Employee Picture** FactBox.

## To register various information about an employee

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employees’ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. Choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
4. **In the Alternate Address List** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat step 4 for each alternate address.

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Updating standard costs with the Standard Cost Worksheet](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-the-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

# Business Central for multi-site and international organizations

Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the headquarter company and the sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.
