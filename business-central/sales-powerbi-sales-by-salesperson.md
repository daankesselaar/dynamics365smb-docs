## Use the report

This report helps management and sales teams track the sales amounts that each salesperson generates and their contribution to the overall revenue.

Sales managers can use the report to monitor the sales performance of each salesperson and identify top-performers. For example, this information is helpful when you determine rewards. The report also helps identify under-performers who perhaps need support.

For example, you might notice that a particular salesperson's sales declined over the last few months. With this information, you can provide extra training or resources to help that salesperson achieve their sales targets.

Salespeople can use the report to monitor your own sales performance and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing the sales amount, quantity, and gross profit, you can easily identify which customers and items contribute the most to your sales. With this information, you can focus your efforts on the most profitable areas.

For example, if you notice that a particular customer contributes a significant amount to your sales numbers, you can focus on building a stronger relationship with that customer to increase their loyalty.
