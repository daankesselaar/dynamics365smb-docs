##### Actual Capacity Cost

**Formula**

Calculates the actual cost of capacity usage based on production order lines and related inventory adjustments. Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Variables for Production Order Details**:
   The measure defines variables for the **Production Order Number**, **Production Order Line Number**, **Item Number**, and **Production Order Status** from the **Production Order Lines** table.

2. **Inventory Adjustment Lines**:
   It then creates a table of relevant inventory adjustment lines that correspond to the current production order line, with the condition that the **iSFinished** status is set to **TRUE** if the production order status is **Finished**.

3. **Inventory Adjustment Details**:
   The measure selects the order number, item number, and order line number from the inventory adjustment lines.

4. **Capacity Ledger Entries**:
   It then filters the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table to match the **Order No.**, **Order Line No.**, and **Item No.** from the inventory adjustments and ensures **Subcontracting** is excluded.

5. **Return the Actual Capacity Cost**:
   Finally, the measure calculates the sum of **directCost** from the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table, dividing it by the **ShareOfCapCost** measure to account for the specific share of capacity costs.

This complex calculation ties together various production and inventory details to derive the actual capacity cost for the production orders.

**Data Source**

- Capacity Ledger Entry
- Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)

##### Actual Capacity Overhead Cost

##### Actual Manufacturing Overhead Cost

**Formula**

Calculates the total overhead cost incurred during manufacturing by combining indirect cost percentages and per-unit overhead rates with actual production metrics. Here's how it works:

1. **IndirectCost**:
   It sums the **indirectCostPercent** values across all production order lines.

2. **OverheadRate**:
   It sums the **overheadRate** values across all production order lines.

3. **OutputQty**:
   It calculates the total output quantity from the **Item Ledger Entries** table, filtered to include only entries of type **"Output"**, and scoped to the currently selected production order.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   The measure multiplies the sum of the following by the **IndirectCost** percentage (converted from percent to decimal), and then adds the product of **OutputQty** and **OverheadRate**.

   - [Actual Material Cost](#actual-material-cost)
   - [Actual Capacity Cost](#actual-capacity-cost)
   - [Actual Subcontracted Cost](#actual-subcontracted-cost)
   - [Actual Capacity Overhead Cost](#actual-capacity-overhead-cost)

**Data Sources**

- Item Ledger Entry
- Capacity Ledger Entry

##### Actual Material Cost

**Formula**

Calculates the total material cost consumed in production by summing the **costAmountActual** from the **Value Entries** table, filtered to:

- Include only entries where **Item Ledger Entry Type** is **Consumption**.

The result is then multiplied by **-1** to reflect material consumption as a cost.

**Data Source**

- Value Entry

##### Actual Subcontracted Cost

**Formula**
Calculates the total direct cost of subcontracted work associated with production orders. Here's how it works:

1. **Context per Line**:
   For each row in the **Production Order Lines** table, it defines key variables:

   - ProdOrderNo
   - ProdOrderLineNo
   - ProdOrderItem
   - ProdOrderStatus

2. **Inventory Adjustment Matching**:
   It retrieves matching rows from **Inventory Adjustment Entry Order Line**, where:

   - THe order number, line number, and item match the production order line variables.
   - The **iSFinished** flag corresponds to whether the production order is marked as **Finished**.

3. **Subcontracted Capacity Ledger Entries**:
   It then filters the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table to:

   - Match the order number, order line number, and item number from the inventory adjustment.
   - Include only entries where **Subcontracting** is **TRUE**.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   It calculates the total **directCost** from these filtered subcontracted capacity ledger entries and divides it by the **ShareOfCapCost** measure.

5. **Aggregation**:
   `SUMX` iterates this logic over all production order lines, returning the total actual subcontracted cost.

This measure isolates and aggregates costs related to subcontracted operations.

**Data Source**

- Prod. Order Line
- Capacity Ledger Entry
- Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)

##### Prod Order Actual Capacity Need

**Formula**

Calculates the actual capacity used for production orders, converted into the unit of measure specified in the manufacturing setup. Here's how it works:

1. **Manufacturing Time Factor**:
   Retrieves the appropriate time factor from the **Time Factors** table based on the capacity unit defined in the **Manufacturing Setup**.

2. **Quantity Calculation** (`Qty` variable):
   Iterates over filtered *Capacity Ledger Entries* (excluding subcontracting), and for each row:

   - Determines the **Qty Per Capacity Unit of Measure** (defaulting to 1 if zero).
   - Looks up the appropriate **Time Factor**:

     - If the **Qty Per Capacity Unit of Measure** is zero, it uses the time factor based on the work center’s unit of measure. Otherwise, it uses the time factor based on the entry's own capacity unit.
     - Computes the adjusted quantity as `quantity / QtyPerCapUnitOfMeasure * TimeFactor`.

3. **Final Conversion**:
   Divides the total adjusted quantity by the **Manufacturing Time Factor** to express it in the target unit.

This measure provides a standardized view of how much capacity was actually used, accounting for differences in units and time factors across capacity entries.

##### Expected Manufacturing Overhead Cost

**Formula**

The **Expected Manufacturing Overhead Cost** measure calculates the total manufacturing overhead cost for a production order by:

1. **Retrieving Direct Cost**:
   It uses the variable **ExpMfgDirCost**, which represents the expected manufacturing direct cost.
     - **ExpMfgDirCost** = [Expected Material Cost](#expected-material-cost) + [Expected Capacity Cost](#expected-capacity-cost) + [Expected Subcontracted Cost](#expected-subcontracted-cost) + [Expected Capacity Overhead Cost](#expected-capacity-overhead-cost)

2. **Iterating Over Production Order Lines**:
   For each line, it adds:

   - The value of **ExpOvhdCost**: Calculated by iterating over each row in the **Production Order Lines** table. Multiplying the **overheadRate** by the **quantityBase**.
   - A percentage-based overhead component, calculated as the line’s **indirectCostPercent** multiplied by the total **ExpMfgDirCost**, divided by **100**.

3. **Summing the Result**:
   `SUMX` aggregates the per-line overhead contributions into a total.

   Filters the **Work Center** table to include only those with a **Subcontractor No.**. For example, subcontracted operations.

2. **Calculating Expected Operation Cost for Subcontracting**:
   Computes [Expected Operation Cost](#expected-operation-cost) restricted to those subcontracting work centers.

3. **Determining Share of Total Capacity Cost**:
   Retrieves the **ShareOfTotalCapCost** for the current production order from the **Production Order Lines** table.

   Multiplies the **Expected Operation Cost for Subcontracting** by the order’s share of total capacity cost.
