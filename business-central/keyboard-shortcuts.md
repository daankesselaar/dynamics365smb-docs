# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

| Select these keys<br>(these keys in macOS) | To do this |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Show access keys for selecting actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu of the page. Learn more in the [Access keys for action bar and navigation menu](#access-keys-for-action-bar-and-navigation-menu) section. |

|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>|Open a related record's card or list page filtered to the value in the lookup or assist edit field|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Down arrow</kbd> | Open a related record's card or list page, which is filtered to the value in the lookup or assist-edit field. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> | Show the tooltip for a field or a column header of a table. If the field has validation errors, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> to show the validation error. Select the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> to close the tooltip. |

| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> | Reload the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application. (The effect is similar to the effect of selecting the **Refresh** or **Reload** button in the browser.)|

## Access keys for action bar and navigation menu

Access keys are keyboard shortcuts you can use to select specific actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu for easier navigation. They're similar to the access keys in Excel and Word. Access keys are available in the Business Central web client only when the display language is set to one of the [supported languages](#supported-languages).

To use access keys on a page, first select the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key to show *key tips*. Key tips are letters in small boxes next to the actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu.

To select an action, select the key combination that is shown in the key tip, such as <kbd>H</kbd> or <kbd>J</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.

- If the action has a submenu of other actions, the keys tips for the submenu are shown. You can then continue to use access keys if you want.
- If the action opens a different page, key tips are turned off. To show them on the new page, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.
