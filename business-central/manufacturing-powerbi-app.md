# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Manufacturing app gives insights into your manufacturing activities. Its detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data help:

- Streamline manufacturing processes
- Improve decision-making at all levels of the organization
- Optimize production efficiency

## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization

COOs need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently you're using your resources and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process, and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.

## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: improving resource usage

Manufacturing managers ensure that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-average-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates them by work center. This report can help you catch unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example scenario: tracking production lines

Manufacturing supervisors ensure that goods and materials flow smoothly through the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report shows the use of work centers in real-time, which helps you spot bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underused. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical use of work centers and find trends and patterns. This report helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This report helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.
