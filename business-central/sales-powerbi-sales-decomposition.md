## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to identify trends, break down sales metrics into their key contributing components, and make informed adjustments to strategies.

As the CEO of a furniture company, the report enables you to assess high-level sales trends and identify key drivers behind performance changes. For example, you notice that sales of office desks drive significant growth in a certain region. The decomposition tree reveals that 30% of this growth is attributed to new customers acquired in the past quarter. Based on this insight, you decide to invest in expanding marketing campaigns to attract buyers in other regions.

As the regional sales manager, the report helps you monitor contributions at individual locations and optimize regional sales strategies. For example, you spot that a location has seen a 15% drop in sales, primarily due to a decline in sales of classic desks. In response, you assign a dedicated salesperson to the region to focus on re-engaging client and offer special discounts.
