# Manually transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you applied and processed all CODA statement lines, you can manually transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal. The financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference between the two balances. Posting isn't allowed if the statement line amounts don't balance with the statement ending balance. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-automatically-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).
