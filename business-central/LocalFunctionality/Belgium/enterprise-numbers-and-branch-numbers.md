# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the companyâ€™s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table
