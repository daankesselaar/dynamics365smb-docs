## Localization architecture

Starting with release 2023 wave 1 (v22.3), Swedish localization is updated to work as an extension on a top of W1 BaseApp. For the next three releases, you can choose whether to enable new features. After this period, old features will become obsolete and the new localization will be automatically enabled.
