# Dutch electronic banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct debit files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank statement import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.
