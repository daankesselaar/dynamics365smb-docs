# Norwegian giro and OCR-B font

A General Interbank Recurring Order (giro) is a payment system that operates like a credit transfer.  

The last line on the giro uses the OCR-B font. Bankenes Betalingssentral (BBS) requires this to be used with optical character recognition (OCR) when handling payments from customers. Learn more in [Brukehåndbok Indbetalingstjeneste (NO).pdf](https://www.nets.eu/no-nb/SiteCollectionDocuments/Egiro/Brukehåndbok%20Innbetalingstjenestene%20(NO).pdf) on the NETS.eu website.  

The OCR-B-10 BT font is generally available from software vendors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], Norwegian sales documents use the OCR-B-10 BT font from BitStream Inc. on the giro. Learn more at the fonts.com website at [OCR-B-10 BT](https://www.fonts.com/font/bitstream/ocr-b-bt/10).  

You can use any OCR-B font, but if other fonts are used, a Microsoft Certified Partner is required to update the sales documents. Contact your partner for more information.
