# Remittance errors in the Norwegian version

Remittance errors for payments might occur when data is transferred and after payments are sent to the bank. Both kinds of errors are reported on the **Return Error** page.  

The remittance system handles all error codes, which can be sent through the return files. It isn't required to manually cancel payments rejected by the bank.  

## Types of errors  
There are two types of remittance errors:  

- Transfer error  
- Rejection  

## Transfer errors  
If errors occur during transfer and no return data is created, the bank didn't receive the payments.  

If the payment file can't be sent to the bank, you must cancel the payment order in the remittance system.  

## Rejections  
If there's an error or information is missing with a payment that was sent to the bank, the return contains a rejection of the payment.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Rejections vary from bank to bank. Contact your bank regarding how to handle rejection of payments.  

If there's a rejection, the error code from the bank and an explanation is displayed for the payment on the **Waiting Journal** page. You have to handle the rejection based how the remittance agreement was set up. For more information, see [Set Up Remittance Agreements](how-to-set-up-remittance-agreements.md).
