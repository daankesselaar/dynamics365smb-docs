# Export remittance payments in the Norwegian version

You can use the export remittance payments process to export the payments file to your computer. You can then transfer the remittance payments to the bank.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you can export a remittance payment, you must select a payment format in the **Payment Export Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

You export payments to a bank file by choosing the **Export Payments** button on the **Payment Journal** page. The process might be different, depending on the export format that you select:  

- Payments using the SEPA payment standard are directly exported to a file when you choose the **Export Payments** button. Learn more in [Making Payments](../../payables-make-payments.md).  

- Payments using local payment standards, such as **Telepay**, are exported with either the **Remittance - export (bank)** or the **Remittance - export (BBS)** report, which automatically opens when you choose the **Export Payments** button.  

The procedure for exporting payments using the **Remittance â€“ Export** batch job is described in this article.
