# Post a negative entry in the German version

You can use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. To meet legal requirements, this field is visible by default in some journals, but if not, you can personalize the page to add them. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

## Post a negative entry  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
1. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
1. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** checkbox.  
1. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.
