# Disregard payment discounts

Use the disregard payment discount at full payment feature to accept payments when the following conditions are true:  

- Payment discount date < payment date <= payment tolerance date  
- Full amount >= payment amount >= full amount - payment discount  

## Disregard a payment discount  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line with the payment term for which you want to activate or deactivate payment discounts.  
1. Select the **Disreg. Pmt. Disc. at Full Pmt** checkbox to initiate activation for this feature. To deactivate, clear the checkbox.
