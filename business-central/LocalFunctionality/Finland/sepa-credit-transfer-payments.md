# SEPA credit transfer payments in the Finnish version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Finnish enhancements to allow you to create Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) credit transfer files to send vendor payments to banks. A SEPA credit transfer is a payment that is transferred according to the file format specified by the European Payments Commission.  

> [!NOTE]
> Users can use new SEPA formats. To do this, the user needs to use a new code unit *13413* "Exp. SEPA CT pain.001.001.09" and report *13413* "Exp. SEPA CT pain.001.001.09" that can export files in a new format.
