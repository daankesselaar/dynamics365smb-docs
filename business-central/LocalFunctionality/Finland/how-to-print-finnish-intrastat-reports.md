# Print Finnish Intrastat reports

Companies in the European Union (EU) must report the extent of their trade with other EU countries/regions according to specific rules. You must report the movement of goods to the Intrastat authorities in their respective countries/regions.  

The completed entries can be sent in a file to the Intrastat authorities, or you can print a report and manually enter the information on the forms from the Intrastat authorities.
