# Set up 340 reports for small businesses in the Spanish version
Use the following procedure to set up your business to report on a cash basis, that is, Cash Accounting Criteria (CAC). If you haven't already done so, you can set up posting groups for cash-based VAT accounting for purchases and sales.  

When you file a report 340, any transaction lines that are associated with unrealized VAT are assumed to take place under cash accounting.  

After VAT posting is set up to handle unrealized VAT, any printed sales order, purchase order, and so forth, will be modified to have the following label in bold font added to the report just before the section reporting the document lines: **RÃ©gimen especial del criterio de caja**.  

## To set up reporting under CAC  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.

5.  On the **General** FastTab, set the **Unrealized VAT Type** to **Percentage**.  
6.  On the **Sales** and **Purchase** FastTabs, specify general ledger accounts for the various **VAT Unreal. Account** fields.
