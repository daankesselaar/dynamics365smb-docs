# SII - Invoice and Credit Memo Types in Sales and Purchase Documents

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Spanish SII requirements for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Immediate Information Supply).  

Learn more about how to set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for SII at [Set Up SII for VAT Reporting in the Spanish Version](sii-setup.md).  

The following sections show the output of the various types that are used for invoices and credit memos and how they're implemented in the Spanish version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Sales invoices

|--|--|--|
|F1|Invoice|Normal invoice.|

|F3|Invoice issued to replace simplified invoices issued and filed|Same as for F1.|
|F4|Invoice summary entry|Possible, but the XML file is same as for F1 because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support summary invoices. <br /><br />Submissions will result in known error: Missing `NumSerieFacturaEmisorResumenFin` element.|
