# Create report 347 in the Spanish version

All companies must provide an annual declaration, **Report 347**, to the tax authorities providing the sales and purchase transactions from the previous fiscal period.  

The Report 347 declaration is generated in a format that tax authorities approved to upload to their Virtual Office website or submission on CD-ROM.  

Before you create the Report 347 declaration, you can run a report to identify payments in cash that isn't applied to a document.  

## Identify unapplied payments in cash  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **347**, and then choose the link for the **347 Declaration** area.  
1. Choose the **Unapplied Payments in Cash** action.
