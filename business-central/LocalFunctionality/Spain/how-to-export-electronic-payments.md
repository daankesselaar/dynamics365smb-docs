# Export electronic payments in the Spanish version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export payment journal entries into a file format according to four different payment standards. You must use the following pages to export according to the different payment standards.  

|Payment standard|Page to export from|  
|----------------------|---------------------------|  
|AEB N34|**Payment Orders**|  
|AEB N34.1|**Payment Orders**|  
|E-PAY|**Payment Journal**|  
|SEPA|**Payment Journal** or **Payment Orders**|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you can export a payment, you must select a payment format in the **Payment Export Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page.
