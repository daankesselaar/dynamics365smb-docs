# Set up and close income statement balances

You can use income statement balancing accounts to balance and track several accounts at the same time. The **Close Income Statement** batch job transfers income statement accounts to an account in the balance sheet, and closes the income statement accounts. When the **Close Income Statement** batch job is run, the entries are automatically posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The fiscal year must be closed before the batch job can run.  

## Set up the income statement balance account  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select an existing general ledger account, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
1. Expand the **General** FastTab.  
1. In the **Income Stmt. Bal. Acc.** field, select the adjustment account for the auxiliary commercial account.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > During adjustment, balances are expensed or credited to this account.  

1. Enter information into the required fields, and then choose the **OK** button.
