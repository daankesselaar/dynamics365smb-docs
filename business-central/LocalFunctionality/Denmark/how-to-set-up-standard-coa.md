# Standard chart of accounts in Denmark

The new Danish bookkeeping act requires the use of a standard chart of accounts. Because of this requirement, the Danish tax authority is providing a standard chart of accounts that can be used. Use the chart of accounts when you prepare annual accounts, and when you calculate regular tax and value-added tax (VAT) payments. You can use any chart of accounts that's included on the **Chart of Accounts** page. However, for required reporting, you must use the **G/L Mapping** page to map all general ledger (GL) accounts with the standard chart of accounts that's required by the law.

## Set up a standard chart of accounts

GL accounts require a specific standard chart of accounts for use in Denmark. Before you start, make sure that you install the **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. After you configure your GL accounts, your exported files (Standard Audit File for Tax \[SAF-T\] and Regnskab Basis) are based on the configured mappings. To configure a standard chart of accounts, provide the GL account as explained in [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).

Learn more in [Danish Local Functionality](denmark-local-functionality.md), which provides a list of features that are specific to Denmark.
