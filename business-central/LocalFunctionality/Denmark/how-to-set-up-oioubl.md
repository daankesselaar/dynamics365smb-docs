# Set up OIOUBL

You must define a location for storing Offentlig Information Online UBL (OIOUBL) files when you create electronic documents such as invoices or credit memos. You must also define payment methods, payment terms, and item charges, and you must set up relevant customers for OIOUBL.

* Set up customers for OIOUBL.  

### About OIOUBL profiles

OIOUBL profiles are adaptations of business processes for various types of transactions, and differ depending on the types and contents of the documents that are exchanged. In Denmark, the two profiles that are required are the **Simpel fakturaproces** (Procurement-OrdSim-BilSim-1.0) and **Billing Basic** (urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0) profiles. The Billing Basic profile is based on the Northern European Subset (NES). Your customer must be able to receive documents in one of these profiles. If you aren't sure, ask your customer about the profile they require. Refer to the entry on OIOUBL profiles in the frequently asked questions section at [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://aka.ms/Digitaliseringsstyrelsen).  

The default profile for all customers is the Simpel fakturaproces profile, which is chosen on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. You specify the profile for a specific customer on the **Customer** card. If you want to use the Billing Basic profile you need to add it. To do so, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the button in the **Default Profile Code** field, and then choose **New**. Enter a name for the code, and then in the **Profile** field, enter **urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0**. You can then choose the profile either as the default profile, or for one or more customers.

## Set up payment terms

If you set up payment terms for customers, the electronic documents include discounts you give for early payments.
