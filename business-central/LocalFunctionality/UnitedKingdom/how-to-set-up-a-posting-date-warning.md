# Set up a posting date warning in the British version

A warning message displays when you post or batch post sales and purchase documents with a posting date not same as the work date. You must set up for this on the **Sales Receivables Setup** and **Purchases Payables Setup** pages.  

## Set up a posting date warning for sales and purchases  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Receivables Setup** page or the **Purchases Payables Setup** page, in the **General** FastTab, select the **Posting Date Check on Posting** checkbox.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A warning message displays when you post or batch post documents with a posting date not same as the work date. If you select **Replace Posting Date** checkbox while batch posting, you're warned about the replacing posting date not being the same as the work date.
