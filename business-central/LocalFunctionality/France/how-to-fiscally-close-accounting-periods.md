# Fiscally close accounting periods

When a fiscal period is complete, you can fiscally close the period to make sure that no more general ledger entries can be posted.  

## Process to close accounting periods  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
1. On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Fiscal Period** action.  

   If more than one fiscal period isn't fiscally closed, the earliest one should be fiscally closed. A message appears to identify the period that should be closed and explains the consequences of closing it.  

1. To fiscally close the period, choose the **Yes** button.  

When the period is fiscally closed, the **Fiscally Closed** field is selected, and the **Fiscal Closing Date** field is updated for the period.
