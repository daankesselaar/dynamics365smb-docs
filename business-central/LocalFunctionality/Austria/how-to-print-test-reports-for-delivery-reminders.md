## Print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder List** page, choose the **Delivery Reminder - Test** action.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder - Test** page, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.
