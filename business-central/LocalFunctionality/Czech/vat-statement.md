# VAT statement in the Czech version

The VAT Statement report contains many improvements, which enable the user to:

- Add Stat. Reporting Setup with general setup for VAT reporting.
- Add two new operation rows (Row Division and Row Multiplication) in the **Type** field.
- Add setup for VAT from advances.
- Filter the **VAT Entries** selection for the VAT statement line by the **EU Triangular Trade** field. This is required, as EU (European Union) triangular trade (middle person – one debtor) must be reported in separate rows.
- Print the VAT Statement report with a new option to round off calculated amounts in the VAT statement to the nearest whole value.
- Filter data based on VAT date using VAT periods.
- Filter data for the posted VAT statement of later date.
- More VAT statement types – Recapitulative, Corrective, Supplementary (by §43 part 1 of VAT Law 235/2004) – payer can submit a supplementary VAT statement.
- Export the VAT statement to an .xml file.
- Add comments and attachments to export to the tax authorities.
