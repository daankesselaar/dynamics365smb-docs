# New design of output documents in the Czech version

A new set of printed reports for external documents is created. All documents have the same layout design (headers, footers, font type, and size, etc.).

Additionally to standardization, Dynamics NAV documents were extended according to all requirements required by the Czech legislation:  

- Registration No., VAT Registration No.
- Deduction of advances with information about invoice and date of payment received
- VAT specification printout grouped by VAT Identifier
- Naming of tax corrective documents based on Credit Memo type
- Printout of documents related to advance payments
