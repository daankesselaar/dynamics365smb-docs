# Inventory movement templates in the Czech version

Movements of items from item journals must be posted with the defined Inventory Adjmt. Account that corresponds to the given type of movement.

## Define custom templates for posting inventory movements

Within the template, it's possible to set the type of transaction (negative adjmt., positive adjmt., transfer, etc.)  and the Gen. Bus. Posting Group (define Inventory Adjmt. Account).
These settings are automatically copied to the item journal line based on the selected inventory movement template.

Inventory movement templates can be used mainly for posting movements in the item journal and  journal. They have other uses in posting differences in the physical inventory of items.
