# Financial report feature in the Czech version

Financial reports are one of the most extensively used features for analysis and reporting to which Eastern European countries/regions often ask for these improvements:

- Common list of expressions – Contains named lines for use in formulas in all financial reports. You do this by defining one of the financial reports as a common list of expressions called a shared financial report.
- Saving results (current state) of analysis – Allows you to store the results of analysis done using financial reports, modification of results, and retrieval of results later on.
- Formulas drill-down – Allows you to drill down on the results of formulas, including for totaling type formulas. By drilling down on the result of the formula, you get a new page containing the list of elements used to calculate the results and their descriptions.
- Additional data sources – Enables you to perform analysis on value-added tax (VAT), customer, vendor, and value entries in addition to performing analysis on general ledger (G/L) entries.
