# Cash desk localization for Czech (extension)

In the Czech version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], the Cash Desk functionality helps companies with the legislation requirements and best practices in Cash Desk operations.

The Cash Desks and Cash Documents features allow you to define cash accounts and Cash Desks for the physical receipt and money withdrawal. Each Cash Desk must have a separate number series of the cash documents. You can set up separate number series for the receipt cash documents and withdrawal cash documents.
