# Cash Desk localization for Czech (extension)

In the Czech version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], the Cash Desk functionality helps companies with the legislation requirements and best practices in Cash Desk operations.

The Cash Desks and Cash Documents features allow you to define cash accounts and Cash Desks for the physical receipt and money withdrawal. Each Cash Desk must have a separate number series of the cash documents. You can set up separate number series for the receipt cash documents and withdrawal cash documents. The Cash Desk cases are predefined cases to simplify data entry. You can specify individual user authorized to operate with the particular Cash Desk and transmit Cash Desks between users.

## Key Features

- Cash Desk setup, Cash Desk users

The Cash Desk card contains basic information about the Cash Desk, such as number, currency, contact details, etc. It also contains settings for posting, definitions for controls and limits, and preset No. series for Cash Desk documents.
