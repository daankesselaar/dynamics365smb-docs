# Fixed asset posting of disposal

Czech accounting standards require specific posting when a fixed asset is being disposed of or being sold. After selling or posting fixed assets, the posting of disposal ensures that the fixed asset value remains the same as the acquired value after depreciation.

The fixed asset remains unchanged even after it's put to use. When the fixed asset is depreciated periodically, a corresponding sum is debited from the acquired cost at the time of disposal. The balance amount is the current fixed asset value.

On the **Depreciation Book** page, select the **Corresponding G/L Entries on Disposal** check box to make this feature operational. Also select the **Corresponding FA Entries on Disposal** check box to retain the correspondence between G/L entries and FA entries.
