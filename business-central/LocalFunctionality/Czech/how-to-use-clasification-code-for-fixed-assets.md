# Classification code in the Czech version

The Tax of Income Law 586/1992 insists on sorting fixed assets by production classification marked CZ-CPA and by building operations classification marked CZ-CC. The new **Classification Code** table and the **Classification Code** field are added. The field is used for FA classification to the tax group.
