# Rounding account in inventory in the Czech version

The Rounding Account in the Inventory feature enables you to post all rounded costs (rounding entries in the Value Entry table) to another General Ledger Account instead of the Inventory Adjustment Account. This feature enables you to post a rounded cost on a different Account than the acquisition cost.
