# Advanced features of the physical inventory in the Czech version
To comply with the legislation, companies require differentiation of accounting of deficits and surpluses. Thanks to the setting of default Whse. Net Change Template for these inventory movements in the Inventory Setup, the user can easily change Gen. Business Posting Group depending on the type of inventory movements.

Companies need to distinguish the posting of inventory movements of the same goods so they require line-break of physical inventory Journal line. Such accounting is required for legal reasons. For example, they need to have a different account for deficits in the limit, and another account for deficits over the limit.
