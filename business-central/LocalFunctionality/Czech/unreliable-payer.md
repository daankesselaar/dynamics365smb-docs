# Unreliable payer in the Czech version

The amendment of VAT Law 235/2004 (ยง106a) introduced the concept of *Unreliable Payer*. The treasury department is obliged to publish the names of unreliable payers.

This feature uses this service to obtain published information and indicate payer status on vendor cards and purchase documents.
The treasury department also publishes information about registered bank accounts of the payer (only these accounts are allowed for payments). Information about payer registered bank accounts is stored on the vendor bank account cards and used in cash management.
