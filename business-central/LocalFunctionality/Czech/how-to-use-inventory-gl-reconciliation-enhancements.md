# Inventory – G/L reconciliation enhancements in the Czech version

Since the Czech localized application contains modifications in the inventory posting (special Account for rounding functionalities and special intermediate WIP accounts), this must also be included in the **Inventory – G/L Reconciliation** matrix form.  
These modifications are introduced to the interface and the calculation procedures are modified.
