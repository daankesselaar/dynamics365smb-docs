# Fixed asset location/responsible history report in the Czech version

This feature provides users with the ability to track changes to the location and responsible employee for fixed assets.

With the addition of this feature, users are able to control location history of the fixed asset and the history of employees responsible for the fixed asset.
This feature also provides reports for company verification where a specific fixed asset is/was located or to whom it is/was assigned.

To enable FA Location and responsible-employee tracking (FA history), user must first enable this feature by selecting the **Fixed Assets History** check box on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. User can then start to track changes in fixed assets' location and responsible employees. The changes are stored in the **FA History Entry** table.

Items of fixed assets:

- Save changes in FA evidence
- Include time and user stamp changes

New reports for transactions and history documentation added:

- FA Assignment/Discharge
- FA History
