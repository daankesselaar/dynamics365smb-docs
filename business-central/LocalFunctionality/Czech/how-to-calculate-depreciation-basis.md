# Calculation of depreciation basis in fixed assets in the Czech version

Due to Czech legislation, it's necessary to calculate tax depreciations from the depreciable basis, which can be different from acquisition costs. According to the requirements, the formula mentioned above that is defined in the Income Tax Act, is modified to calculate depreciation amounts using the Czech declining-balance depreciation method for the second and following years of a fixed asset's life.

The tax depreciation is calculated annually and the **Force No. of Days** option is recommended for calculating the correct depreciation amount.
