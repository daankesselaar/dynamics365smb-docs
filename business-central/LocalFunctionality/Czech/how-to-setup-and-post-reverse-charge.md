# Reverse charge - Setup and posting in the Czech version

To set the regime of transferred tax liability and its reporting. The setting of Tariff and Commodity Numbers ensures monitoring of invoice posting in the appropriate mode (normal or transferred tax liability) and their correct reporting in the VAT control report. As soon as the monitoring of the limit of a given commodity is switched on (PDP check field in the VAT posting settings), if the limit is exceeded (setting in the Commodities code list), a message is displayed stating that the invoice must be charged in the appropriate mode. The codes reported in the control report are set in the Tariff Numbers code list.
