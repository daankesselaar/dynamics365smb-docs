# Check for requests to change posting group in the Czech version

The standard functionality extends with checks if there's a request to change posting groups for customer, vendor, item and bank account cards.

- On the Customer Card, the customer's posting group can be changed if there are no open customer entries.
- On the Vendor Card, you can change the vendor posting group if there are no open vendor entries.
- On the Item Card, you can change the item posting group if there are no open item entries and at the same time there are no uninvoiced closed item entries.
- On the Bank Account Card, you can change the posting group of the bank account if the Balance or Balance (LCY) isn't zero.
