# Check of output in inventory – time sequence in the Czech version

The standard functionality of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] is extended by checking the time sequence of warehouse operations. After activating the check, ensure that it isn't possible to delivery items with a posting date preceding the posting date of its receipt.
