# Customers/Vendors reconciliations in the Czech version

At the end of each fiscal year (or another period, when requested), companies send a statement of balances to Customers and Vendors in order to reconcile them with Customer and Vendor records. Customers and Vendors either confirm the statement or not and send it back with corrections, based on their own information. This feature allows users to prepare such report in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)].
