## To print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.

3.  On the **Delivery Reminder - Test** page, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.
