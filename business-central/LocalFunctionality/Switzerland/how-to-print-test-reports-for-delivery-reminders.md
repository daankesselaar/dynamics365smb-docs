# Print test reports for delivery reminders in the Swiss version

After you create delivery reminders and make any needed modifications in Switzerland, you can either print the test reports or issue the delivery reminders.  

A test report is a document that lets you review and modify a delivery reminder before you issue it.  

## Print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder List** page, choose the **Delivery Reminder - Test** action.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder - Test** page, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.  
1. Choose the **Print** to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.
