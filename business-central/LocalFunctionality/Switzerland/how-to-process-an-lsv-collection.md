# Process an LSV collection in the Swiss version
You can use the **LSV Journal** page to create and process payments from Lastschrift Verfahren (LSV+) customers. You can register these payments in the cash receipt journal, create an LSV file, and then print the collection order. For more information, see the Cash Receipt Journal page and [Export Payments Using LSV](how-to-export-payments-using-lsv.md).  

When you run the **LSV Suggest Collection** batch job, each suggested collection is registered on an LSV journal line, and the open invoices are transferred to the LSV journals. For more information, see the LSV Journal table.  

You can view, edit, or delete the suggested payment lines. If you correct the suggested amount, then the difference is marked as a discount. You can run the batch job multiple times for different customer groups. The suggestion lines can be placed in the same journal.  

## To create an LSV collection  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **LSV Journal List**, and then choose the related link.
