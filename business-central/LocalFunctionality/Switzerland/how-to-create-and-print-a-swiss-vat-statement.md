# Create and print a Swiss VAT statement in the Swiss version
Based on the information that you have specified on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically create a new VAT Statement Setup for realized VAT reporting. Before proceeding with the procedures in this article, make sure that you have set up VAT posting setup with values specified for the sales and purchase cipher fields.  

>[!NOTE]
> From January 2024 onward, the Cronus company's VAT Statement has been refreshed to include new Ciphers 303 and 383.  

## To set up a Swiss VAT statement template  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update VAT Statement Template**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select a template in the **VAT Statement Template Name** field.
3.  Choose the **OK** button. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to create a new template.  
4.  Check the resulting VAT Statement and adjust as needed.  

     The VAT Statement page contains the **VAT Statement Cipher** field, which indicates in which cipher of the report the result will be printed. This field is automatically populated by the batch job based on the information on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. The field can be edited if needed.
