## To set up general journal batch

Journal batches are created based on the journal templates. All journal batches created from a specific template have the same structure, default settings, and information defined in the template. However, since these settings are defaults, business users can change them for a specific journal batch.
Batches are typically used to separate one user's entries from another. For example, User-A and User-B both work on general journal entries. User-A typically makes entries and posts them later when they are approved. To keep User-B's entries from becoming mixed with User-A's entries, separate batches can be assigned to the two users.
