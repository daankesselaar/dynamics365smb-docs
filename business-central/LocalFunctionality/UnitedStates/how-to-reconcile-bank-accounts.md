# Reconciling bank accounts in the US version

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bank reconciliation and deposits features are no longer available for the North American versions (US, CA, and MX) in 2023 release wave 2. The features are now part of the standard version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], so that more countries can benefit from them. To learn more about the standard features, go to [Manage and Reconcile Your Bank Accounts](../../bank-manage-bank-accounts.md).
>
> For details about what changed, go to [Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions).
>
> If you're still using the deprecated **Bank Reconciliation Worksheet** or **Deposits** pages, there are a few things you should do after you upgrade to 2023 release wave 2. For example, if you have open entries, you'll probably want to complete them. To learn more, go to [NA bank reconciliation and deposits are deprecated in the North American version](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-na-bank-rec).

Use the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page to reconcile bank account ledger entries with bank statements.
