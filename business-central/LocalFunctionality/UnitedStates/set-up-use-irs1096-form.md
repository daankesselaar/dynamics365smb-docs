# Set up and use the IRS 1096 form in the US version

Form 1096 is used to transmit paper tax forms to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. This feature lets you run the Form 1096 report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and send it to the IRS, if necessary. The feature is only related to already transmitted paper 1099 forms.

> [!NOTE]
> Form 1096 reporting supports only the IRS codes that are supported for Form 1099 reporting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. If you add other IRS codes to lines on the Form 1096, the report doesn't include them.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The IRS 1096 feature is compatible only with the [legacy 1099 functionality](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md), which lets you submit printed 1099 forms. The [new IRS 1099 feature](set-up-use-irs1099-form-v24.md) supports only electronic submissions, and not printed forms, so the 1096 form isn't required and this feature isn't compatible with the IRS 1099 feature.

## Enable the extension

Form 1096 is an extension. After you install the extension in your environment you must enable it, as described in the following steps.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Feature management**, and then choose the related link.
1. Find **Feature: Enable using Form 1096 to transmit paper Tax Forms to the IRS in the United States** and in the **Enabled for** field, choose **All Users**.
1. When you enable the feature, use the setup guide to set it up. The only information required is to specify the **IRS 1096 Form No. Series** to use. This number series is used to assign numbers for 1096 forms per certain period.

If you didn't use the setup guide to configure **IRS 1096 Form No. Series**, you can do so on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. Fill in the **IRS 1096 Form No. Series** field on the **Number Series** FastTab.

Complete the following steps to set up more required fields for reporting.

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
1. To specify the EIN number to show on the report, on the **Communication** FastTab in the **EIN Number** field, enter the number you registered with IRS.  
1. To specify who communicates with the IRS, in the **IRS Contact No.** field, select the employee responsible for this communication.  

## Create a new 1096 form

> [!NOTE]
> The IRS 1096 report layout currently supports reporting for the year 2023.  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1096 Forms**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Create formsâ€¦** action to create a new entry.
1. In the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, specify a date range for the calculations. Vendor ledger entries with posting dates in this period are considered.
1. If you want to replace existing forms with new forms, for example, if you made corrections, choose the **Replace** option. If you don't select this option, new forms are created and existing forms remain the same.
1. After you create the new forms, choose **OK**. A confirmation displays the message, **IRS 1096 forms have been created**.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a 1096 form for each of the IRS codes posted in vendor ledger entries during the period you defined.

You can open the forms to review and correct them if necessary.

- **Starting Date** - Specifies the starting date of the period specified for the form.

- **Manually changed** - Specifies that the line was changed manually. This field is marked automatically if a record is changed manually.
- **Amount** - Specifies the amount used for printing the form. This value matches the calculated amount minus the calculated adjustment amount after choosing the **Create Forms** action. You can change this value. If you change this amount manually, the **Manually changed** field is marked.
