# Basic tax setup in the US version

To ensure compliance with local tax reporting, use the **Tax Setup** page to define basic tax information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The page guides you through settings such as choosing the proper group code for nontaxable sales and the default accounts for posting calculated tax.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries/regions that use value-added tax (VAT). For information about how to set up and report VAT in your country/region, see the articles in the [Local Functionality](../../about-localization.md) section.

## Set up taxes

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Setup**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Tax Setup** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
   * On the **Default Accounts** FastTab, specify the general ledger (G/L) accounts to use for posting calculated tax on different transactions. Learn more about how to set up or edit G/L accounts in [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](../../finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you are in the US, we recommend running the **Tax Setup** together with the **Set Up Sales Tax** assisted guide. Learn more about the guide and other important pages and fields to set up in [Sales Tax in the US](us-sales-tax.md).
