# Set up initial item costs in the Italian version

When you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in your organization, you must define initial item costs.

On the **Before Start Item Cost** page, you can enter information about inventory items, such as component costs, routing costs, and overhead costs.  

## Set up initial item costs  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Before Start Item Cost**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. Enter information into the required fields. This includes the **Starting Date**, **Purchase Quantity**, **Purchase Amount**, **Production Quantity**, and **Production Amount** fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

The entries in this page are used to calculate the average year cost. For more information, see Item Cost History List and Calculate End Year Costs.
