# Define debit and credit amounts

The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields are included in multiple journals and tables, including the **General Journal**, **Cust. Ledger Entry** table, and **Vendor Ledger Entry** table. The debit and credit amounts must match in the journals and tables, or you'll be unable to post or save.  

## Steps to define debit and credit amounts  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Debit Amount**|Enter the debit amount.|

    > [!WARNING]  
    > The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields must match. If the amounts are different, you will not be able to post or save the journal.
