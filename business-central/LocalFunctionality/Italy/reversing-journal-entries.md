# Reversing journal entries in the Italian version

Controls are added to the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page to comply with local laws. These controls prevent you from performing the following actions:  

- You can't reverse an invoice, credit note, or document involving VAT management.  
- You can't reverse posted invoices, credit memos, or debit memos.  
- You can't delete posted invoices, credit memos, or general journals in the sales, purchase, or service areaâ€”even if they have been printed.  
- You can't reverse sales, purchase, or service headers for reserved documents.
