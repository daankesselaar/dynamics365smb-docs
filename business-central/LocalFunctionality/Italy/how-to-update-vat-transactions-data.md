# Update VAT transactions data
Before you create the first VAT transaction report, you should prepare the existing data by running the **Update VAT Transaction Data** report. You should also run this report if you make changes to the setup based on new requirements from the tax authorities.  

You can run the **Update VAT Transaction Data** report as a test before you change any data. When you verify that the filters meet your expectations and the requirements of the tax authorities, you should run the report again to make the appropriate changes to data.  

> [!CAUTION]  
>  Before you run the **Update VAT Transaction Data** report, you should activate the change log on the **Change Log Setup** page. Also, you should enable logging for modifications to the **Include in VAT Transac. Report** field on the **VAT Entry** table.  

## To update VAT transaction data  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update VAT Transaction Data**, and then choose the related link.
