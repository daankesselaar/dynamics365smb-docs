# Electronic invoicing in New Zealand

This article provides information on how to work with the New Zealand localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

You can read detailed information on how to set up the E-Documents framework in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> The E-Document framework for the New Zealand localization supports only the Peppol PINT A-NZ format.

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PINT A-NZ**.  
1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up E-Documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
1. In the **Service Integration** field, you can select any service provider available for the New Zealand market with whom you have an agreement.  
1. Close the page.
