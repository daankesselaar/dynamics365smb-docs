# Delete posted invoices and credit memos in the Icelandic version

## Before v24.0

In Iceland, in accordance with legislation, you can't delete sales and purchase invoices and credit memos after they're posted. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the **Delete** command isn't available for these types of posted documents. 

## After v24.0

If you activate the new [Icelandic localization based on W1 Base App](iceland-global-core-app.md), you can delete sales, purchase invoices, and credit memos, but only in cases where they're older than seven years at the beginning of the new fiscal year.

> [!NOTE]
> The deletion is technically controlled with the new ENUM field **Document Retention Period** in the **General Ledger Setup** page. This field is hidden and has the **IS Docs Retention Period** option by default enabling this control.
