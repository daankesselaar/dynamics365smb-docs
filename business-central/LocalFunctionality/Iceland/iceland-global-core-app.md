# Iceland W1 core app setup

Microsoft completed the delocalization process for the Icelandic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] from version 24.0. The new Icelandic localization uses the W1 base app, and all localization features are delivered as apps. The migration isn't enabled by default. Users must do it manually when they decide that they want to complete this process.

To complete the migration to new localization model, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Iceland Core App Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. Select the **Enabled** field to enable the Iceland core app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This process includes data migration. Therefore, after you enable the Iceland core app, you can't turn it on again.

1. Select **Next**.
1. Select the **I accept the data update** field to confirm that you understand the update procedure and agree to proceed. We highly recommend that you select the **Review Affected Data** link to review the affected data.
1. Select **Finish**.
