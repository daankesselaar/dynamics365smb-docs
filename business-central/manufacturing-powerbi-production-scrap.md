# Production Scrap (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Production Scrap** report presents important key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Scrap %** and **Scrap Quantity by Work Center**, **Machine Center**, **Source No.**, and **Production Order**.

The **Production Order Scrap %** KPI card highlights the relationship between **Finished Quantity** and **Scrap Quantity** to help clarify the drivers behind the production order scrap percent.

The **Scrap Quantity Over Time** chart shows how scrap quantity changes over time. This chart allows you to identify trends in production scrap as processes change.

Work center and machine center statistics display in the KPI Bar. **Work Center Scrap %** and **Machine Center Scrap %** are derived from the **Work Center Scrap** and **Work Center Output** respectively. These figures help you understand the efficiency of your production facilities at a glance.

The **Scrap % by Production Order** chart gives you an easy way to compare scrap rates across different productions orders. Cross filter this report by the **Scrap Quantity vs. Expected Scrap Quantity by Source No.** chart to identify which production orders contribute to the scrap rate.

The **Scrap Quantity by Scrap Code** visual allows you to quickly compare and analyze why scrap occurred.

Used together, these visuals help uncover where and why waste is happening, so you can take steps to reduce it.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing managers.

COOs use the report to measure the effectiveness of manufacturing processes and resources. By analyzing the capacity scrap quantity, you can identify areas that need improvement and optimize resource use. For example, a high scrap rate at a particular location might indicate a problem with the machinery or the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can reduce waste and improve efficiency, leading to cost savings.

For manufacturing managers, this report reveals important measures about capacity scrap quantity. By analyzing the scrap rate, you can identify areas that need improvement, such as processes or materials. For example, a high scrap rate for a particular item category might indicate a problem with the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can optimize resource use to reduce waste and save costs.
