# Machine Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Machine Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each machine center. Use this report to ensure that machine centers aren't overloaded.

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on machine centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded machine centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular machine center. Additionally, by monitoring the machine center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a machine center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for machine center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all machine centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The Machine Center Load report includes the following KPIs and measures:
