# Copilot in Business Central overview

This article answers common questions about Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## What is Copilot in Business Central?

Copilot is the AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. Copilot in Business Central is the world's first AI-powered assistant across all lines of business. With Copilot in Business Central, small and medium-sized organizations empower their workers through intuitive AI tools that boost creativity and save time.

## Where can I find the list of Copilot features in Business Central?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Learn more in [Work smarter with Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://aka.ms/BCAI).

## How does Copilot approach security, privacy, and compliance?

Copilot is built on the Microsoft cloud and designed for enterprise use, with the security, privacy, and compliance controls that our customers expect. Here are some key points to common questions:

- When a user interacts with Copilot, it inherits their data permissions and can't read any more data than the user already has access to.
- Microsoft doesn't read your prompts or use your data to train AI models without your explicit permission.
- For customers within the EU Data Boundary, data doesn't move outside that boundary. 

Learn more about Copilot data security and privacy in Dynamics 365 at [FAQ for Copilot data security and privacy for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/faqs-copilot-data-security-privacy) and data movement across geographies in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

## How does Copilot approach AI safety?

Generative AI within Copilot in Business Central aligns with Microsoft's responsible AI principles, including fairness, reliability, safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Learn more in [Responsible AI FAQs for Business Central](responsible-ai-overview.md) or explore our [Responsible AI transparency report](https://aka.ms/RAITransparencyReport2024).

## Is Copilot free?

## Does Copilot in Business Central require a minimum number of users?

Currently, no minimum number of users is required to start to use Copilot in Business Central.

## How does Copilot use the Azure AI time quota that is included with licenses?

Business Central offers numerous AI-powered features. Some features, such as sales and inventory forecasting, use specific machine learning models. These features rely on Azure AI and aren't related to Copilot. As the Dynamics 365 licensing guide indicates, 30 minutes of Azure AI time are included with Business Central licenses. This quota refers to non-Copilot features, where consumption of Azure AI time has no effect on Copilot in Business Central.

## Is Copilot in Business Central available worldwide?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Each Copilot capability defines its own list of supported regions and supported languages. Although most features might be available only in English at first, we aim to unlock more languages and regions over time. Learn more at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).

## Is Copilot aware of my environment customizations?

Some but not all Copilot features can work with your custom pages, tables, and other content from the apps that you have installed. For example, you can use [analysis assist](analysis-assist.md) on your custom lists, or you can use [chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md) to find records in custom tables. Learn more about how each Copilot feature works with your customizations in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md) and [Chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md).

The accuracy and user experience of Business Centralâ€™s AI-powered features might vary based on the apps that you have installed.

## Does Copilot have to be trained on my data?

Copilot in Business Central relies on powerful AI foundation models that are coupled with data management features of the Business Central platform. No expensive or time-consuming training is needed before your organization can start to use Copilot with your own company data.

## Can I develop my own copilots for Business Central?

Microsoft empowers people to achieve more through copilots that are adapted to different situations.

Copilot in Business Central is the AI assistant that is intended specifically for the Business Central app.

## Does Copilot in Business Central work with Copilot for Microsoft 365?

Currently, there's no direct connection between Copilot in Business Central and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot features inside Business Central are unaware of your Microsoft 365 data.

Conversely, when working in the Microsoft 365 suite of applications there are options for Copilot to use Business Central data. One such option is Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance, a stand-alone product that uses general GPT training data, Microsoft 365 Graph data, and ERP information. Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance can connect to Business Central and work with ERP data useful to specific contexts and scenarios, like collections management.

Learn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance with Business Central in [Collect outstanding balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md). Learn more general information at [Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-finance).

## Is Copilot available for Business Central online only?

Yes, Copilot is exclusive to Business Central online. Therefore, it isn't available for other deployment types, such as on-premises or private cloud.

## Is Copilot available to Embed applications?

Currently, because of technical limitations, we can't offer Copilot to customers who run independent software vendor (ISV) Embed apps. ISVs can extend Copilot with their own functionality or provide alternative uses of generative AI.
