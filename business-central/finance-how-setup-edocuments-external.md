# Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that this article describes, you must install the **E-Document Core** app and one of the E-Documents connectors with external endpoints apps. You can use these apps for default integration with the external, non-Microsoft, access points to automate the e-document flow. Because these apps represent only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations.

## Install an E-Documents connector  

To install an E-Documents connector, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.
3. Choose the connector you want, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.
4. Install the app from the AppSource.

## Set up the connection

Based on the endpoint service provider, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents to.
4. Turn on the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** toggle to indicate whether to use the global location number (GLN) as an identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** app.

The following list of access point providers are covered by default:  

- Avalara
- B2BRouter
- Logiq
- Pagero
- SignUp

Microsoft has no contractual obligations with these providers. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get the necessary credentials. The services might require extra licensing or payments for their services.
