# EBITDA (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **EBITDA** report provides an overview of your company's performance from the perspective of both earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). You can review EBIT and EBITDA over time to identify trends in operational performance and inform decisions about cost management and pricing strategies.

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to evaluate cash flow potential before making strategic decisions. By analyzing EBIT, you can gauge the efficiency with which your core business generates profits from operations. EBITDA excludes both nonoperational costs and noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization. Use EBITDA when you compare your business to your peers in the industry.

EBITDA is good for comparing cash flow potential across similar businesses. EBIT offers a fuller picture of profit by including asset-related costs, which is essential for assessing long-term operational efficiency.
