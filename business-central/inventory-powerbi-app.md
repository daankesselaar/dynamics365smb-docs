# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.
