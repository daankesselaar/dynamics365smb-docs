# What is Shopify?

Shopify is a subscription-based application that allows you to set up an online store and sell products. The Shopify platform offers online retailers a suite of services for payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement.

## What is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Shopify Connector?

With the Shopify Connector, businesses can link their Shopify stores with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to maximize business productivity. Using the Shopify Connector, you can access and manage insights from your business and your Shopify online store as one unit.

### Capabilities

  - Each shop has its own setup, including a collection of products and locations used to calculate inventory and price lists.  
- Bidirectional synchronization of items or products.
  - The connector synchronizes images, item variants, bar codes, vendor item numbers, extended and marketing texts, tags, and metafields.  
  - Export item attributes to Shopify.  
  - Use selected customer price groups and discounts to define prices exported to Shopify.
  - Define prices and discounts for product catalogs linked to B2B companies.
  - Decide whether items can be created automatically or only allow updates to existing products.

  - Update inventory levels on multiple locations in Shopify.  
- Bidirectional synchronization of customers and companies.
  - Smart-map customers by phone and email.  
  - Use specific country/region templates when creating customers, which helps ensure that tax settings are correct.  
- Import orders from Shopify
  - Include orders created in various sales channels, such as online stores, **Shopify POS**, or **B2B**.
  - Shipping costs, gift cards, tips, shipping and payment methods, transactions, and risk of fraud, return, refund, or cancellation information.
  - During import, you can automatically create customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] or decide to manage the customers in Shopify.  
  - Receive payout information from Shopify Payments.

  - Optionally, choose to transfer item tracking information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify.
