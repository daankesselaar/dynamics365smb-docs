# FAQ for technical details

This article answers frequently asked questions about the Shopify Connector.

## Which Microsoft products work with the Shopify Connector?

The connector is available only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The connector is preinstalled for new environments. Organizations with existing environments can download and install the connector from AppSource. The organization must have both a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license and a Shopify license to use the connector. To learn more about supported countries/regions, languages, and editions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Shopify Connector on the AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238).

It isn't available for on-premises deployments.

The Shopify connector doesn't work for [Embed App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview), where the client URL has the `https://[application name].bc.dynamics.com` format.

The Shopify connector doesn't work with other Dynamics 365 applications, like Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## What support is offered for the Shopify Connector?

To learn more, go to [Support for the Shopify Connector](shopify-support.md).

## Currently unsupported features; however, we're tracking them and may consider adding them

- Markets
  - Prices per country/region. One price list is available for the selected currency. Shopify handles the conversion to other currencies.
- Draft orders

## Is the Shopify Connector extensible?

The Shopify Connector offers a few points of extensibility. We're keeping the number of points to a minimum so that we can follow the rapid development on the Shopify side without introducing breaking changes. However, the most important scenarios are covered. 

To learn more and explore some examples, go to [Extend the Shopify Connector](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extending-shopify).

Instead of building every modification as an extension, we suggest that you investigate whether you can contribute code to the Shopify Connector through a codevelopment process with Microsoft.

## Is the Shopify Connector open for contribution?

This extension is open for contributions from our community. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/Shopify) in the Microsoft AL application add-ons repository.

## Building your version of the Shopify Connector

According to Shopify, if you want to build and publish a connector app on Shopify marketplace that has the primary purpose of transferring or sharing merchant data to a third party ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]), you must have written consent from Shopify. As part of this process, you must get consent from Microsoft in the "End Recipient Data Acknowledgement Form". We need to ask you to handle the matter with Shopify because Microsoft can't sign third-party agreements.

### What to do

Check the Shopify requirements because you still might be able to have an unlisted app.

Alternatively, the Shopify Connector for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] constantly gets new features and new customers. If you discover a specific gap, consider [submitting a product suggestion](https://aka.ms/bcideas) or a code contribution to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. For requirements that might not be relevant for a majority of customers, and can't be easily addressed by the current extensibility model, please reach out to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] development team to discuss the use case. We should be able to find a feasible solution.
