# Production Order WIP (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

 The **Production Order WIP** report provides insights into the work-in-progress (WIP) inventory across production orders, displaying both trends and detailed valuation data.

The **Production Order WIP Report** consists of two key visuals that give insights into work-in-progress (WIP) inventory. The top visual is a timeline chart that showcases the **Ending Balance Value of WIP** inventory over time. The visual plots the **Ending Balance Value** as the Y-axis and the **Month Year** as the X-axis to offer a clear trend analysis and lets you find fluctuations and patterns in WIP inventory.

The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** table gives you a detailed breakdown of production order-related inventory valuation. The table includes essential columns, such as:

- Production Order
- Description
- Source Type
- Source No.
- Starting and Ending Dates
- Beginning Balance
- Consumption
- Capacity
- Output
- Ending Balance Value

Together, these visuals provide both high-level and detailed perspectives on WIP inventory.
