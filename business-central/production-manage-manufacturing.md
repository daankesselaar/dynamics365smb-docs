When demand is planned for and the materials are issued according to production BOMs, production operations can start in the sequence defined by the production order routing.  

An important part of production, from a system point of view, is to post production output to report progress and to update inventory with the finished items. You can post output manually, by filling in and posting journal lines after production operations. Or, it can post automatically with the use of backward flushing. In that case, material consumption is automatically posted along with output when the production order changes to finished.  

As an alternative to the batch journal for output posting for multiple production orders, you can use the **Production Journal** page to post consumption and/or output for one production order line.

There are a few things to set up before you can start production. For example, work centers, routings, and production BOMs. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Manufacturing](production-configure-production-processes.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
