# Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

## Project Analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: view project costing performance

CFOs want to ensure that you aren't overspending on specific projects from a high-level. By analyzing the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against its budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) report to view key information on profit statics per project.

## Project analytics for project managers

To fit this category, you might have a role such as Project Manager.

### Example scenario: tracking project completion and sales

Project managers want to know how each project is performing and get high-level information about them. The [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report can help you compare key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by using either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) reports.
