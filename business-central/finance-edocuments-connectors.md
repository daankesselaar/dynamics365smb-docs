# Connect E-Documents to external access points

[!INCLUDE [e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

You can use E-Documents in Business Central to send and receive electronic documents with your business partners. To receive documents, you need to connect E-Documents to an external access point that handles the communication and validation of the documents.

 > [!NOTE]
 > These connections require communication with external service providers who might require other payments and contracts. To get the credentials you need, contact the service providers.

The steps to connect E-Documents to an external access point depend on the type of connector you choose.

## Available service providers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports Pagero, Avalara, Logiq, SignUp, and B2BRouter access points for e-documents. If we add more connectors, we'll update this article with the parameters when they're ready. You can also find more connectors on AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> This article doesn't explain how to connect with local service providers. You can learn more about the local service providers that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports in the country-specific documentation.  

Microsoft doesn't have a contractual obligation with Pagero and Avalara. You must have a contract with them if you want to use their connectors.
