# Enabling Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to get [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ready for integration with Power BI. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already enabled for integration, although there's some information about licensing that you might want to read. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have set up your environment to connect to Power BI before users can work with it.

## <a name="license"></a>Power BI Licensing

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users get a free Power BI license that provides access to the most common features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. You can also purchase a Power BI Pro license that provides access to additional features. The following table provides an overview of the features available with each license.

|Power License|View reports|Create reports|Share reports|Refresh reports| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps|
|-------------|--------||
|Power BI free|![a checkmark.](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace)  | ![another checkmark](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace) |(limited)|(limited)||
|Power BI Pro|![yet another checkmark.](media/check.png) |![it's a checkmark](media/check.png)|![again a checkmark](media/check.png)|(extensive)|![last checkmark](media/check.png)|

You can't use a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] free license for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps. To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).
