# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.
