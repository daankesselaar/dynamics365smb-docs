## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to identify the primary drivers of sales performance and uncover actionable insights.

As the CEO of a furniture company, this report can help you identify the furniture categories that drive the highest sales. For example, you might discover that ergonomic chairs are a major revenue contributor, with sales figures typically three times higher than other types of chairs. This insight can guide your investment decisions and provide valuable data to share with stakeholders.

As a sales manager, this report can help you identify the customer demographics behind sales trends. For instance, the **Key Influencers** visual might reveal that a significant number of office desk orders are placed by customers located in a certain region, with a higher likelihood of ordering quantities of five or more, which is twice as often as customers in other regions.

Using this insight, you can develop targeted strategies. For example, offering bulk pricing discounts for office desks, encouraging larger purchases and strengthening customer loyalty. You can optimize your pricing strategy while catering to regional buying behaviors.
