# Project Register (report)

The **Project Register** report shows one or more selected project registers.

You can filter the report to show only the register entries that you want to see. If you don't set a filter, the report can be impractical because it can contain a large amount of information.

On the project journal template, you can indicate that you want the report to print when you post.
