# Fixed Asset Book Value 01 (report)

The **Fixed Asset Book Value 01** report shows detailed information about acquisition cost, depreciation value, and book value for individual assets and groups of assets. The detailed information is also summarized at a group level, if needed.

If you select the **Budget Report** field, the report calculates the expected depreciation for the period. Enter a group type if you want the report to group the fixed assets and print group totals. For example, if you have six FA classes, select the **FA Class** option to print a group total for each FA class.
