# Maintenance Register (report)

The **Maintenance Register** report shows posted maintenance entries that are sorted by register number.

You can set a filter to specify the register to show entries for. It's important to set a filter because otherwise the report might show a large amount of information.

You can set up the report to print as a part of the posting process. That is, you can print it when you post. To print the register when you post the journal, choose the **Post and Print** action in the journal.
