# Maintenance - Analysis (report)

The **Maintenance - Analysis** report shows detailed maintenance expenses for fixed assets.

You can choose whether to use posting dates or fixed asset posting dates to control the data the report shows.

The report has three amount fields that can show maintenance amounts broken down by different maintenance types. Select the maintenance code for the maintenance type you want to include in the report.

The report has three period fields in which you can select one of the following options:

- Before Starting Date
- Net Change
- Ending Date

**Net Change** is the period between the starting and ending date. The option you select determines how the report calculates maintenance amounts.

The report lets you group fixed assets and calculate totals by category. For example, it can show maintenance expenses for fixed assets in each fixed asset class. You can also choose to show amounts for each fixed asset.
