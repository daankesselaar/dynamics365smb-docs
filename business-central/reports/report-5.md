# Receivables-Payables (report)

The **Receivables-Payables** report shows a summary of outstanding accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) balances and compares them to the general ledger (G/L). You can select a posting date and currency to tailor the report.

The report displays a side-by-side comparison of customer and vendor balances versus their respective G/L control accounts. This helps confirm consistency and highlight reconciliation issues.

## Use cases

[!INCLUDE [report-5-scenario](../includes/report-5-scenario-include.md)]

Controllers and finance teams can use the report to:

* Reconcile AR and AP subledger balances with their respective G/L control accounts during financial close.
* Identify discrepancies between subledger and ledger balances.
* Confirm consistency and highlight reconciliation issues.
* Quickly verify if AR and AP subledgers match their respective control accounts in the G/L.

Auditors can use the report to:

* Verify that customer and vendor balances align with the G/L.
* Investigate mismatches that could indicate posting errors or timing issues.
