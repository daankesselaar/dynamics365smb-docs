# Insurance Register (report)

The **Insurance Register** report shows posted insurance ledger entries sorted by register number.

You can set a filter to specify which register to show entries for. It's important to set a filter because otherwise the report might show a large amount of information.

You can set up the report to print as part of the posting process. That is, it can print when you post. To print the register when you post the journal, select the **Post and Print** action in the journal.
