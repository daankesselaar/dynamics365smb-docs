# G/L Deferral Summary (report)

The **G/L Deferral Summary** report analyzes the effect of deferrals on general ledger (G/L) balances by period, giving transparency into future recognized values.

You can use filters such as a posting date and deferral code to narrow the scope of your review.

## Use cases

[!INCLUDE [report-1700-scenario](../includes/report-1700-scenario-include.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Here are some tips on how to use the report:
>
> * Use posting date filters to focus your review. Narrow the report to a specific period by setting posting date filters. This filter helps isolate deferral activity for a particular month, quarter, or fiscal year, making reconciliation easier.
> * Apply deferral code filters for targeted analysis. If your organization uses multiple deferral codes (for example, for different revenue streams or expense types), filtering by deferral code allows you to analyze the impact of each category separately.
> * Reconcile deferred balances periodically. Run the report at regular intervals (for example, month-end or quarter-end) to reconcile deferred balances and ensure that revenue and expenses are recognized in the correct periods.
> * Audit for irregularities in deferral handling. Use the report to spot anomalies, such as unusually large deferrals or missing entries, that might indicate posting errors or misapplied deferral templates.

Finance professionals can use the report to:

* Review deferred entries and their impact on G/L balances over time.
* Summarize deferral activity by G/L account and posting period.
* Reconcile deferred balances and understand how they affect financial reporting.

Controllers and auditors can use the report to:

* Gain transparency into future recognized revenue and expenses.
* Ensure accuracy in deferral postings and compliance with accounting standards.
* Identify discrepancies or irregularities in deferral handling and investigate them.
