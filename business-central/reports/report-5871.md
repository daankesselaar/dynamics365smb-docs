# Item - Able to Make (Time) (report)

The **Item - Able to Make (Time)** report tracks the availability of bill of materials (BOM) items over time, based on five key figures that adjust according to supply and demand, and the availability of components for assembly or production.

Use this report to determine whether you can fulfill a sales order by a certain date. The report looks at your current inventory and the amount you can produce from available parts.

The data displays in a graph that shows the total quantity you can produce at any given time.
