# Maintenance - Next Service (report)

The **Maintenance - Next Service** report shows the next date on which service and repairs are planned for each asset.

For each asset, the report gets this date from the **Next Service Date** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.

You can define a period (starting date and ending date) for the assets to include in the report.

- Fixed assets that have a next service date before the date in this field aren't included.
- Fixed assets that have a next service date after the date in this field aren't included.
