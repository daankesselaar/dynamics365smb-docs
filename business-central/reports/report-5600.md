# Fixed Asset Analysis (report)

The **Fixed Asset Analysis** report provides a comprehensive examination of an organization's fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, for different purposes.

You can specify two date columns and three data columns to display in the report.

For example, to generate a report for reconciling with the general ledger, add columns for:

* Acquisition cost at an ending date.
* Depreciation at an ending date.
* Book value at an ending date.

A check report could have acquisitions/net change, write-down/net change, and appreciation/net change, so you can check every change to a fixed asset.

If you select the **Budget Report** field and specify an ending date in the future, the report calculates the future depreciation and gives estimates for future depreciation and book values, if you selected those fields as report columns.
