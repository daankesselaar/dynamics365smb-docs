# Closing Trial Balance (report)

The **Closing Trial Balance** report shows this year's and last year's general ledger (G/L) account debit and credit balances. For income statement accounts, the report shows balances without closing entries. The report lists closing entries on a fictitious date between the last day of one fiscal year and the first day of the next.

You typically post the closing of the income statement accounts at the end of a fiscal year.

Use the report to verify that all financial transactions are accurate and that the total debits equal the total credits, so you're sure the books balance before you close the financial year.
