## Customer Table

**Customer Measures**

- [No. of Customers](#no-of-customers)
- [No. of Lost Customers](#no-of-lost-customers)
- [No. of New Customers](#no-of-new-customers)
- [No. of Recovered Customers](#no-of-recovered-customers)
- [No. of Returning Customers](#no-of-returning-customers)
- [Sales Lost Customers (12M)](#sales-lost-customers-12m)
- [Sales New Customers](#sales-new-customers)
- [Sales Recovered Customers](#sales-recovered-customers)
- [Sales Returning Customers](#sales-returning-customers)

### No. of Customers

**Formula**  

Distinct count of the **Customer No.** column from the **Sales** table.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Lost Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were "lost" (stopped purchasing) within the current date selection. It determines the latest date in the selection, prepares a table of customers and their associated "lost" dates, and then filters out the customers whose lost date is within the selected date range. Finally, it counts the rows in this filtered table to get the number of lost customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure counts new customers by finding the date of their first purchase. It includes customers if their first purchase happened within the date selection.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were temporarily "lost" (stopped purchasing) but later made a new purchase. It identifies customers who had a "lost" date before the selected date range, then determines which customers made a new purchase within the current period. The measure filters and counts only those customers whose new purchase occurred after their lost date, returning the total number of recovered customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who made a repeat purchase during the current period. It identifies existing customers by filtering customers whose first purchase was before the selected date range, then determines which of these customers made another purchase within the current period. The measure returns the count of these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Lost Customers (12M)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales lost over the past 12 months due to customers who stopped purchasing ("lost" customers). It first identifies the most recent "lost" date, then filters customers who were lost before that date. It gets the sales from the previous 12 months for these lost customers and calculates the total revenue they generated before they stopped purchasing.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales from customers who made their first purchase within the current date range. It identifies each customer's first purchase date, filters out customers whose first purchase occurred during the selected period, and then sums the sales amount from those new customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by recovered customers. Recovered customers were previously lost but made a purchase afterward. It identifies temporarily lost customers, checks whether they made a new purchase in the current period, and then sums the sales figures for them.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by returning customers. Returning customers are customers who made their first purchase before the current period and made more purchases in the current period. It identifies returning customers by finding the intersection of active customers and customers who purchased previously, and then sums the sales from these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
