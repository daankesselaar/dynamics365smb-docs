# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). ATo use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

Follow the steps to set up Intrastat reporting.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, select or enter field information as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes some of the key fields.

   | **Zip File(-s)** | Specifies whether the report files should be added to the zip file. |
   | **Data Exch. Def. Code – Receipt** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file for received goods. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **Yes**. |
   | **Data Exch. Def. Code – Shipment** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file for shipped goods. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **Yes**. |

6. On the **Numbering** FastTab, enter a value in the **Intrastat Nos** field.

### Set up a reporting file

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **General** FastTab, enter information about the data exchange definition, data file type, column separator, related codeunits, XMLport, and other fields as needed.
3. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, enter a value in the **Line Type** field to describe the formatting of lines in the data file and where you need to define the number of columns for this line.
4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column. 
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new entry.
7. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Table ID** value (for **Intrastat Report Line**, choose **4812**), and enter the following field information:

   1. Specify the **Field ID** value for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** value for each column as needed. The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have developed custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a supplementary unit of measure, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks whether you want to update related items. If you choose to update related items, the **Unit of Measure** value on the **Item Units of Measure** page is updated for all items that have the same tariff number.
>
> When you add a tariff number that has a defined **Unit of Measure** value to the item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically adds a new unit of measure to the **Item Units of Measure** value for the item. The **Qty. per Unit of Measure** value is based on the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field.

## Automate the process of inheriting the country of origin for items

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to transfer the country of origin from the purchase document to the sales invoice, you must use item tracking lines. Otherwise, the system won't use the default value.

The sections that follow describe how to set up the transfer.

### Intrastat report

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Intrastat Report Setup** in the **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** field, choose the **Purchase Headers** option.  

### Item  

You must enable item tracking for these items, either serial numbers, lots, or both. To enable item tracking for the item, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the item that you want to configure.
3. On the **Item Card** page, on the **Item Tracking** FastTab, select one of item tracking codes using the **Item Tracking Code** field.
4. When you make a selection, you can see how the item tracking codes are configured.
5. Select the code you want, and select **OK**.

### Use the item in purchase documents

After you select an item that has item tracking enabled on the purchase line, follow these steps.  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and run the **Item Tracking Lines** action.
2. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page after adding **Serial No.** or **Lot No.**, and entering value in **Quantity (Base)** field, choose one of the following options:  
   1. The **Lot No. Information Card** action if you're using lots.   
   2. The **Serial No. Information Card** action if you're using serial numbers.  
3. You can choose **New** (**+**) to create new lot or serial numbers on the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages. 
4. The **Country/Region Code** is populated with the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. You can change it if you want.
5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Reporting** FastTab, check whether **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** is selected. If it is, two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values are configured.
3. Verify that the **Zip File(-s)** field is selected, to ensure that report files are added to the zip file.

The process of working with Intrastat reports is the same as the global feature.

<!-- ### Belgium-->

### Czech Republic

The new Intrastat report experience for the Czech Republic is available in 2023 release wave 1. In the meantime, continue to use the **Intrastat Journal** feature.

### Finland

In Finland, there are a few more steps to set up Intrastat. Intrastat reporting in Finland requires two different files for receipts and shipments. There are also two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Report Setup** page, on the **File Setup** FastTab, enter the field information as described in the following table.
