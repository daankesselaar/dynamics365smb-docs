# Use resources for projects

You record the usage of resources in the project journal to keep track of costs, prices, and the work types that are linked to projects. For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

You can also post the usage of a resource in a resource journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.

## To assign resources to projects

You assign resources to projects by creating project planning lines for the project. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).
