title: Electronic Invoicing FAQ
summary: |
  The built-in document exchange service submits electronic invoices to TradeShift, a  service provider that relays electronic invoices to PEPPOL or NemHandel recipients. But the service supports a limited number of versions.   
  
  This FAQ answers some of the key questions about electronic invoicing.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > Tradeshift integration is no longer supported in Business Central and is planned for deprecation. Instead, please try using the new E-Document functionality in Business Central https://aka.ms/bcedocuments.
