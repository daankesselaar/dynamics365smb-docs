    questions:
      - question: |
          Is there a difference between searching and filtering?
        answer: |
          Yes.
          - Search is simple and broad: it matches records that contain the search text across any visible fields on the page, and is case insensitive.
          - Filtering is flexible and you can apply them to specific fields, including fields that don't display on the page. Filters display records with exact, case-sensitive matches, but you can adjust them with search symbols, tokens, and formulas. To learn more about how to use these features, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
          
      - question: |
          Exactly which fields are matched when searching?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies the search criteria to all fields that display on the page. If a field is hidden, such as by using personalization, search ignores the field. Search criteria are applied to fields only if their data type matches that of the search criteria. For example, searching for the term *today* searches all text and code fields for the literal value "today," and date fields where *today* is evaluated as an expression for the current date. Search doesn't look in numeric fields. To learn more about filter criteria, go to [Filter criteria and operators](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#FilterCriteria).
          
      - question: |
          Is there a keyboard experience for search and filter?
        answer: |
          Search and filter are optimized for mouse-free interaction with data. There are various shortcut keys that you can use to speed up your work. To learn more, go to [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md#KeyboardFilter).
          
      - question: |
          Is the filter pane available on all lists?
        answer: |
          The filter pane is available on pages where the list is the primary content on the page, such as worksheets and list pages, including lists reachable from the navigation bar. The filter pane isn't yet available for lists that display as parts. For example, FactBoxes or Role Center parts, or for lists that display as dialogs, such as in lookups. When a list is embedded on a page, such as sales lines on a sales order, the filter pane is available when focusing on that list using the focus mode button. For more information, see [Focusing on Line Items](ui-enter-data.md#Focus).
          
      - question: |
          How can I save my filters?
        answer: |
          Your filters and adjustments to predefined filters are remembered throughout the session (while you remain signed in), even if you navigate away from the page. You can permanently save filters as a named view of the list by choosing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon in the filter pane. For more information, see [List Views FAQ](ui-views-faq.yml). Unlike filters, search text isn't kept when you leave a page and isn't saved when you save a view.
          
          On report request pages, you can also save filters or use predefined filters. For more information, see [Use Saved Settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).
          
      - question: |
          Are filters the same as Advanced Filters and Limit Totals in Microsoft Dynamics NAV?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] builds upon these popular features and delivers a modern and highly usable experience for finding and analyzing your data. With more keyboard shortcuts and the introduction of search, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] surpasses the functionality provided in Dynamics NAV.  
          
      - question: |
          Can I search and filter using the companion apps and add-ins for Microsoft 365?
        answer: |
          On different display targets, such as mobile devices or in Outlook, you can search in lists but can't filter on individual fields in most cases. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Microsoft Teams, both search and filter are available on lists.
          
      - question: |
          How do I view how my search terms were applied to fields in the list?
        answer: |
          After you enter search terms in the search box, you can view the exact search criteria and which fields they were applied to. Open the page inspection pane (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>), and choose the **Page Filters** tab.

      - question: |
          Can I do anything about the "Searching for rows is taking too long" message?
        answer: |
          There's a time-limit for how long search operations can take. First, try changing the search criteria and search again. If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, contact your system administrator, because an administrator can increase the time-limit for searches.
          
          As an on-premises administrator, you increase the time-limit on searches by changing the **Search Timeout** setting of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance?#Database) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro Help.
          
      - question: |
          Does Microsoft plan to extend the filter pane experience?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          How do I change the output of the decimal separator key on my numeric keypad?
        answer: |
          The region setting in Business Central determines the output character of the decimal separator. The setting is on the **My Settings** page. You can temporarily switch it to a period (.) by selecting the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys. Select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> again to switch back. To learn more, go to [Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).
