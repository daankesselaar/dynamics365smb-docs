## Use the report

The report is intended for business leaders and managers.

COOs ensure that the purchasing department operates efficiently and effectively. One of the key metrics you monitor is the year-over-year growth in purchases. This report lets you quickly explore purchase trends over time, and identify areas of concern. For example, you might notice that purchases are increasing rapidly in a particular item category. You can use this information to discuss how to manage costs with the head of purchasing.

Purchasing managers ensure that the company sources goods at the best price without compromising quality. Use this report to track purchasing trends across different categories and identify areas where you can save. For example, you might notice a rapid increase in purchases of a category of products. With this information in mind, you can work with the manufacturing team to identify whether to change item planning or supplier selection to optimize product cost and quality.
