# Project management

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports project accounting and more:

- Manage project management tasks, such as creating projects and scheduling resources.
- Provide budget information and monitor progress.
- Track machine and employee hours on projects using time sheets.

Project managers have a good overview of their projects, including the employees, machinery, and other resources they involve.

## Get started with projects

Project management can be complicated.
