The report also helps you track the expected capacity need percentage to keep the utilization rate above the required threshold.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the capacity of machine and work centers. The report provides insights into the capacity used by hour, allowing you to optimize the use of your machine and work centers. You can use the gauges to track today's utilization percentage and the current week's utilization percentage, and adjust the production schedules accordingly. The report helps you ensure that you complete production orders on time by keeping the utilization rate above the required threshold.
