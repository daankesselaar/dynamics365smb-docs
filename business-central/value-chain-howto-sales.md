# Sustainability value chain in sales

When you sell items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the **CO2e per Unit** field from the **Item** card for each sales line that contains emission values. It uses the average calculation method to calculate the value.  

When you post all sales documents, the posted documents keep the **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values for each line.

The result of posting shows as a new sustainability value entry for each line that has **Sale** as its **Item Ledger Entry Type**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values aren't used in default report layouts. However, if you want to show these details when you print reports, you can create a new document report to show this data.
