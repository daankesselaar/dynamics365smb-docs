Security groups replace user groups starting in 2023 release wave 1 (version 22). You can keep using user groups until 2024 release wave 2 (version 25).

Security groups work like user groups. Admins assign permissions to the security group so its members can do their jobs. Learn more in [Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups](../ui-security-groups.md).
