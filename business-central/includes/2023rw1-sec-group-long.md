> [!NOTE]
> Security groups replace user groups starting in 2023 release wave 1 (version 22). User groups aren't available after 2024 release wave 1 (version 24).
>
> Security groups work like user groups, but they're defined in Microsoft Entra ID for online or Windows Active Directory for or on-premises instead of Business Central. This setup lets admins reuse security groups with other Dynamics 365 apps. Learn more in [Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups](../ui-security-groups.md).
>
> With Business Central on-premises version 22, 23, or 24, use the assisted setup guide to convert user groups to permission sets. This process helps you transition to security groups.
