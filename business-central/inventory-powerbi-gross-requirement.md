# Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Gross Requirement** report looks at all outbound transactions to determine the quantity required per item.

The report shows the gross requirement for an item and the different documents that include it. This information is coupled with the **Project Available Balance** that calculates the balance at any point in time.

## Use the report

The report helps management and procurement officers to determine whether the organization is keeping up with demand.

Managers can use the report to ensure that stock levels are high enough to maintain the production schedule and sales demand for each item. The report helps identify bottlenecks in production by showing items where the available inventory doesn't meet the gross requirement.

Procurement officers can view sales and production volumes and ensure your available balance meets the requirements for each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions on the items you should replenish.
