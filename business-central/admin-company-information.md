# Company information overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] organizes business entities in *companies*. For each company, you must fill in some of the basic company details and relevant information on the **Company Information** page. The information on the [**Company Information**](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1) page is used in documents, such as invoice headers. You can set up more than one company, such as a parent company and a subsidiary.  

If the company's inventory warehouse is located at a different address than the company headquarters, you can complete the various ship-to fields and the **Location Code** field on the **Shipping** FastTab. The information in these fields is then printed on purchase orders, for example, so vendors ship items to the correct location.  

For each company you set up, you must fill in the **Company Information** page, together with the **General Ledger Setup** page. You must also set up each area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, for each company. Learn more at [Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

The **Company Information** page contains different fields and FastTabs, depending on your country/region. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes the most common FastTabs.

[!INCLUDE [admin-company-info-fasttabs](includes/admin-company-info-fasttabs.md)]

After you fill in the information, you can close the page.  

## Working with multiple companies

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes multiple companies, your users might want to use *company badges* to help them quickly identify and keep track of which company they're currently working in. For more information, see [Display a company badge](#badge).

There are a few features you can use to switch among companies as you work, like the company switcher (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>). Learn more at [Switch to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

## <a name="badge"></a>Display a company badge

When there's more than one company or environment, the company switcher shows on the upper-right side of the app bar near the search icon. By default, the company switcher uses a standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments").

Starting in 2023 release wave 2, version 23, the company badge appears in the browser tab when using the web client. It's also in page links that you [copy and paste](across-share-data-features.md#copying-a-link) in rich text editors, like Word, Outlook, and Teams.

The following video shows how to work with company badges.

### Set the company badge

On the **Company Information** page, you can replace the standard company icon with a custom badge on a per-company basis. A company badge can make it easier to identify the company you're working in.

1. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
2. When done, refresh the browser (select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>) to update the badge in the client.  

> [!TIP]
> A company badge also indicates the type of environment the company is in. A round company badge signifies a production environment, and a square badge signifies a sandbox environment.

## Change company display name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

## Experience

The default user experience in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial doesn't reveal all capabilities. You can switch on the full experience on the **Company Information** page.
