## Use the report

Management and sales teams use this report to track ongoing opportunities and the value they're expected to generate.

As a sales manager, you want to oversee the opportunity pipeline and monitor the performance of salespeople. Using this report, you can review the value by location and sales cycle stage, and identify demographics to focus on. This can help you grow future sales and inform you on where to invest in new marketing campaigns. Additionally, you can analyze key metrics for each salesperson to provide support.

For example, by reviewing the [Win/Loss %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#win-loss-percent), you might identify a salesperson who is underperforming. Using this information, you invest in further training and mentorship to improve their opportunity outcomes and overall profitability.

As a salesperson, the **Opportunity Overview** helps you to monitor your sales performance and manage opportunity progress. Using the sales cycle and location information, you're encouraged to nurture a diverse portfolio of prospects. Meanwhile, insights from the sales cycle stage  motivate you to take action on tasks and advance opportunities.

For example, you might identify an opportunity in the initial stage that has high estimated value. With this knowledge, you decide to prioritize the opportunity and re-engage with the contact to reinforce the client relationship and progress the opportunity.
