# Sustainability Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w2](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

The Sustainability Power BI app provides detailed insight into the emission usage of an organization to support Environment Social Governance (ESG) reporting. The report helps identify key areas to change. The app provides various reports that focus on areas that organizations want to track, such as [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md), [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) and [Social Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=37091).

## Sustainability analytics

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- Sustainability Manager
- Data Analyst

### Example scenario: The sustainability team needs to review their water and waste usage over a period

As someone on the Sustainability team, you want to consistently review your water and waste usage at specific facilities. Using the [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md) report, you can review the capacity at each facility and location to understand the available capacity, should you need it in the future.

The report also allows the team to track different water and waste types along with the YOY and DOD change to ensure they're moving in the right direction.

## Sustainability analytics for the Executive team

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- CEO
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Sustainability Officer

### Example scenario: Ensure targets are being met

For someone on the executive team, you need to ensure targets you put in place for the organization are being met. The [Realized Emissions vs. Target](sustainability-powerbi-realized-emissions-vs-target.md) report can quickly and efficiently compare your actual emissions with your target and make informed decisions about where to make changes.

You can compare the data in this report with the [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) report to ensure your organization is on the right track.

For an executive looking for a quick, high-level view for their organization, you can use the [Sustainability Overview](sustainability-powerbi-sustainability-overview.md) report.

## Alternative use cases

While the reports benefit these examples, in some scenarios other roles can also use this report pack. For example, a Procurement Manager might use the [Emissions by Category and Scope](sustainability-powerbi-emissions-by-category-and-scope.md) report to review Scope 3 so they can identify better vendors. Or, a member of the Human Resources team can use the [Social Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-social-analysis.md) report to get a view of employee activities.
