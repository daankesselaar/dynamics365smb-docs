# Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Customer** report gives a clear picture of your organization's customers and their sales activities. It highlights key metrics for each customer, such as sales amount and quantities along with the costs associated. You can break down the metrics by the specific items that are sold per customer to identify key trends.

## Use the report

This report is meant for all users to identify key customers and other customers that buy less than expected.

A COO can quickly identify a list of the top customers generating revenue for the company. You can easily identify which customers are generating the most revenue and how much each customer is contributing to your company's overall revenue. This information helps you make informed decisions and can provide valuable insights to the CFO regarding where the revenue is coming from.

A business development manager can quickly identify how you're attracting new customers to purchase from your organization. You can break down the metrics to find out how salespeople are performing. This information can then translate into what a sales manager would want to see, and enable them to track how sales are going for different salespeople.

For salespeople, the report you help can tailor your onsite visits to your customers based on their recent purchases. This report can also show you insights into specific period trends for this customer, and identify opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.
