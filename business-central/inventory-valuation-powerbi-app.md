# Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory Valuation app pulls data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to provide business leaders key information about inventory across their organization. The app has various reports that offer insights into costing areas. The report can help you make informed decisions and ensure you account for costs.

## Inventory valuation analytics for leadership teams

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock costs

Chief executives want to identify locations that hold the most stock value. The [Inventory Valuation by Location](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-location.md) report can help you find that location. You can also break down this data by using the [Inventory Valuation by Item](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-item.md) report to explore the value of each item you have on hand.

## How to use the reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

The following table describes on how you can use each report in the app.
