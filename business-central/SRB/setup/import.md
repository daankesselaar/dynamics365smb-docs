# Import of contracts and contract lines

Before you can set up contracts and contract lines, you must create some data, or import it from another system. In addition to customers, vendors, and items, you must create service commitment packages, service commitment package lines, and more. You use configuration packages to import data. The data for customer contracts, contract lines, service objects, and service commitments imports to tables created specifically for processing the data.

## Import of master data

To import customers, items, service commitments, vendor contracts, and so on, create [Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages).

|Name|Table|
|:--|:--|
|Items|27|
|Service Commitment Templates|70920754|
|Service Commitment Packages|70920755|
|Service Commitment Package Lines|70920756|
|Item Service Commitment Packages|70920758|
|Vendor Contract|70920763|

## Import customer contracts, contract lines, service objects, and service commitments

There are particular import tables for importing customer contracts, contract lines, service objects, and service commitments. After the import, you can view, edit, and use the data to create corresponding records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Imported Customer Contracts**, **Imported Service Objects**, and **Imported Service Commitments** pages. Use the following tables to import and create service objects, service commitments, and contract lines.

|Name|Table|
|:--|:--|
|Imported Customer Contracts|70920710|
|Imported Service Objects|70920708|
|Imported Service Commitments|70920709|

### Import customer contracts

The **Imported Customer Contracts** page serves as an intermediate step for the data transfer of service objects. The imported data displays on this page. Use the **Create Customer Contracts** action to create the customer contracts (just headers, no lines). The action always processes all rows that aren't processed, regardless of filters and selection.

|Name|Description|To fill|

|Sell-to Customer No. (Code20)|Indicates the number of the customer who receives the contractual services and is invoiced by default.|Always|
|Sell-to Contact No. (Code20)|Specifies the number of the contact that receives the contractual services. In the contract, the number is the **Sell-to Customer No.** from that customer, if empty.|Optional|

* The **Processed on** field shows the date and time of the processing.
* Errors display in the **Error Text** field.

### Import service objects

The **Imported Service Objects** page serves as an intermediate step for the data transfer of service objects. The imported data displays on this page.

### Import service commitments

The **Imported Services Commitments** page serves as an intermediate step for the data transfer of service commitments and contract lines. Use the **Create Service Commitments** action to import and process the data. This action can create comment lines in contracts, service commitments that aren't billed, and contract lines and service commitments that are billed. The action always processes all lines that aren't processed, regardless of filters and selection.
