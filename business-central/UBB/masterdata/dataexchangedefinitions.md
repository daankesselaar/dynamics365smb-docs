# Data exchange definitions

Data exchange is a standard feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about data exchange and data exchange definitions, go to [Set up data exchange definitions](../../across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md). 

Data exchange definitions are fundamental to import and process data in usage based billing. This article summarizes the key aspects.

The data exchange definition example in this article refers to an import file for usage data. It's a CSV file in UTF-8 encoding with column separators as semicolons. To learn more, go to [Import data in usage based billing](../processing-usage-data/imports-processing.md).

## Definition for data import

For billing, you must first import and process data. To learn more, go to [Imports and processing](../processing-usage-data/imports-processing.md). For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to extract the data from the CSV file, it needs the data's schema. The schema is available on the [usage data supplier](suppliers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Usage based billing provides the **USAGEBASED** data exchange definition as an example. You can use the definition, but you must adapt it to your setup. You can import and export data exchange definitions on the **Data Exchange Definition** page by using the **Import Data Exchange Definition** and **Export Data Exchange Definition** actions.

The **Data Exchange Definitions** page has the following FastTabs:

* General
* Line Definitions
* Column Definitions

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Line Definitions** FastTab is higher on the page, fill in the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab before you enter information on the **Line Definitions** FastTab.

## Settings on the General FastTab

These settings affect the import file. The following table describes the important fields.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|File Type     | For importing usage data, businesses typically choose **Variable Text**.        |
|Type     | For importing usage data, businesses typically choose **Generic Import**.        |
|File Encoding     | The encoding of unicode characters for the import file.        |
|Column Separator     | Specifies the character that separates the columns in the import file. This is only relevant for the **Variable Text** file type.        |
|Header Lines     | Sets how many header lines the import file contains. This ensures that the header data isn't imported.        |

## Settings on the Line Definitions FastTab

On this FastTab, you only have to define one line, so that you can use the **Field Mapping** action to create the mapping between the columns of the import file and the fields of the target table. If you choose **Detail** in the **Line Type** field, a unique **Code** and a **Description** are assigned and the number of columns to process (import) is specified in **Column Count**. The default line with the **Header** line type is deleted.


## Settings on the Field Mapping page

After you fill in the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and create a line on the **Line Definitions** FastTab, you can set up the field mappings. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, choose the **Field Mapping** action, and enter the following settings on the **Field Mapping** page. 

On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as follows:

   * The **Table ID** field should contain **8018**. This is the **Usage Data Generic Import** table.
   * The **Name** field should contain a name.
   * The **Mapping Codeunit** field should contain **8030**. This is the **Generic Import Mappings** codeunit to use for the generic import type when you generate imported lines.
    
On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, fill in the fields as follows:
    
   * The **Column No.** field specifies a column definition, and the **Field ID** field specifies a target field from the table specified in the **Table ID** field.
   * The **Overwrite Value** checkbox indicates that field contents in the target table can be overwritten, if needed. We recommended that you select this checkbox for the **Subscription ID**, **Product ID**, **Product Name**, and **Quantity** fields, as described in the following table.

The following table provides a complete example of a setup on the **Field Mapping** FastTab on the **Field Mapping** page.

|Column No.  |Column Caption  |Field ID  |Field Caption  |Optional  |Transformation Rule  |Overwrite Value  |Priority  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|2    | Customer ID   |  7       |   Customer ID      | |No |No | 0|
|3    | Customer Name |  8       |   Customer Name      | |No | No| 0|
|7    | Subscription ID |10      |   Subscription ID      | |No | Yes | 0|
|8    | Product ID    |  17      |   Product ID      | |No | Yes| 0|
|10   | Product Name |   18      |    Product Name     | |No | Yes| 0|
|11   | Subscription Start Date  |  13  | Subscription Start Date| |No | No| 0|
|12   | Subscription End Date    | 14  | Subscription End Date  | |No | No| 0|
|13 | Billing Period Start Date| 15 | Billing Period Start Date | |No | No| 0|
|14 | Billing Period End Date  | 16  | Billing Period End Date  | |No | No| 0|
|16   | Cost        |  19      |   Unit Cost      | |No | No| 0|
|17   | Quantity    |  21      |  Quantity        | |No | Yes| 0|
|18   | Price       |  20      |  Unit Price      | |No | No| 0|
|19   | Amount      |  24      |  Amount          | |No | No| 0|
|22   | Cost Amount |   27     |  Cost Amount     | |No | No| 0|
|23   | Currency    |  25      |  Currency        | |No | No| 0|
|24   | Text1       | 20       |  Text1           | | No| No| 0|

## Settings on the Column Definitions FastTab

The following table describes the settings that define the columns to import.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     | Specifies the number of the column in the import file.        |
|Name     |  Specifies the name of the column. To keep things simple, we recommend that you use the name from the header of the import file.       |
|Data Type     | Specifies whether the data to import is a **Text**, **Date** or **Decimal**.        |
|Data Format     | Refers primarily to data of the **Date** data type. The field specifies how to format dates. For example, for a date in US format, the value should be **MM-DD-YYYY**.        |
|Data Formatting Culture     | Specifies the culture of the data format, if needed. For example, **en-US** for the **Decimal** data type indicates that a period is used as decimal separator according to US format.        |
|Length     | Only relevant if the file type is set to **Fixed Text**.        |
