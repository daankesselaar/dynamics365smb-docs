# Link subscriptions with service objects

In case an already existing service object should only be connected to a subscription afterwards (for example, if the service object was shipped in advance with a sales order or created in another way), the functionality **Connect Subscriptions to Service Object** is available for this purpose.

The **Connect Subscriptions to Service Object** page shows all subscriptions that aren't connected to a service object. In addition to the familiar fields from the [Usage based billing customers and subscriptions](../masterdata/customers-subscriptions.md), you can select the service object to link by using the **Connect to Service Object** field. In the **Connect to SO Method** field, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] suggests whether you can create the link on the basis of existing service commitments or new ones. The basis for this suggestion is whether the existing service commitments can be billed on a usage basis (the **Usage Based Billing** checkbox is selected for the service object) and are valid. Via **Connect to SO at Date** field, you can specify the date on which to create new service commitments.

After setting the defaults, the subscriptions to process are selected, and you can run the **Connect Subscriptions to Service Object** action. If errors occur, they display in the **Reason (Preview)** field. To correct the cause of the error, use the **Reset Processing Status** action to reset the processing status. After you correct the error, you can reconnect the subscription.

> [!CAUTION]
> You can't create new service objects using the method described here. To create new service objects, use the **Extend Contract** action. To learn more, go to [Extend contract](extend-contract.md).
