# Manage master data synchronization

After you set up master data synchronization, when you synchronize for the first time [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

- Couples records in the selected tables.
- Creates a recurring job queue entry for each table.

The job queue entries automatically synchronize data in the subsidiary companies when someone makes a change in the source company. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> For the automatic synchronization to work, the user who makes the change in the source company must have:
>
> - A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
> - Permission sets that allow them to reschedule a background task in the subsidiary company. To learn more about the required license and permissions, go to [Before you start](admin-set-up-data-sync.md#before-you-start).
>
> Otherwise, the change happens in the next unconditional synchronization run. The unconditional synchronization is controlled by the **Inactivity Timeout Period** field on the job queue entry.

However, sometimes things go wrong, and there might be situations that you need to manage or investigate. For example, if people change the same record in both the source company and a subsidiary, synchronization fails so that you can specify the change that's correct. Or, the source company might install an extension that changes the schema of one of the tables you're synchronizing by adding a field or two. If you want to synchronize the new fields in the subsidiaries, install the same extensions and update the table schemas in their setup.

This article describes the tools you can use to keep synchronization running smoothly.

## Overwrite local changes

You can use the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on the fields and tables you synchronize to allow data from the source company to overwrite data in the subsidiary company.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable the synchronization of a field and allow the subsidiary to write values in it independently from the source company. You must either disable synchronization for the field, or allow the source company to overwrite local changes.

## Update table schemas

If the source company changes a table, for example, by adding a field that you want to synchronize, subsidiaries must update their field mappings. On the **Synchronization Fields** page, use the **Update Fields** action.

## Enable or disable couplings between records

To start or stop coupling on specific records on a table, on the **Synchronization Fields** page, choose the fields, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

## Run a full synchronization

The **Run Full Synchronization** action schedules a synchronization for all of the table records in the source company, and resynchronizes all records unconditionally. For example, resynchronization is useful if you enable an extra field on a synchronization table, or add an extra field by using the **Update Fields** action. The action retroactively synchronizes the data in those fields.

## Synchronize modified records

If you change a setting for a table or field in a subsidiary, you must update the synchronization. To update the synchronization, use the **Synchronize Modified Records** action on the **Synchronization Tables** page.

The **Synchronize Modified Records** action schedules a synchronization of the following table records:

* Records that failed to synchronize in the last attempt.
* Records that were changed in the source company after the last scheduled synchronization. You can review the last scheduled synchronization time on the **Synchronization Tables** page in the **Synchronize Changes Since** field.

The action works in the same way as a scheduled synchronization, and you can use it as a way to synchronize outside the schedule. For example, if you select the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on a field to allow data from the source company to overwrite local changes, the action updates that data. You can also just wait until the next scheduled synchronization happens.

## Investigate the status of synchronization

There are two actions on the **Synchronization Tables** page that can help you monitor your synchronization:

* **Integration Synchronization Jobs**
* **Job Queue Entries**

The following table describes the actions.

|Page  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Integration Synchronization Jobs**     | Open the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page to investigate what happened each time a job queue entry ran. To dig deeper into the details about new records that were added, or explore why a record failed to synchronize, choose the numbers in the **Inserted** or **Failed** columns. You can also use this page to clean up older records that you might not need. To learn more about cleaning up, go to [Clean up old entries](#clean-up-old-entries).        |
|**Job Queue Entries**     | Access details about the job queue entry that synchronize data for a selected table. For example, use this page to manage the status of the job queue entry,    To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you find an error on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page that you can't resolve yourself, if you contact your partner or Microsoft for support, it's helpful to provide the error message and callstack information.

## Clean up old entries

Over time, the number of entries in the synchronization log will become large, so you might want to do a little housekeeping to remove unneeded entries. To make it easier to clean up old entries, the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page offers the following actions:

* **Delete Entries Older Than 7 Days**
* **Delete All Entries**

## Adding extensions

If the source company installs a new extension, the subsidiary must also install it if they want to synchronize data for it. The subsidiary can use the **Update Fields** action On the **Synchronization Fields** page to add the tables from the extension to the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Some tables get data from related tables. If you add an extension that doesn't include related tables, the fields on those tables aren't available. Verify that you added all related tables.

<!--
## Recreate a deleted job queue entry

If the recurring job queue entry is deleted for a table, you can quickly recreate it. On the **Synchronization Tables** page, choose the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action.
