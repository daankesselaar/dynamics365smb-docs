# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. To learn more about permission settings, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. To learn more about custom page layouts, go to [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for specific users, you can enter **Navigation menu only** in the **Description** field. That setting excludes the profile from the list of available roles on the **My Settings** page.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one that has similar settings. When you copy a profile, you also copy page customizations, both user-created and those from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't available to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and sign in.

> [!Caution]
> Don't rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in. They might have to restart [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and sign in again.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. To learn more about user settings, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. To learn more about Role Explorer, go to [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles export to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. To learn more about exporting profiles, go to [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps in the **Import Profiles** assisted setup guide.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a security group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they're using.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization isn't relevant. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all personalized pages and the user they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. To learn more, go to [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. To learn more, go to [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).
