# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

## Use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.
