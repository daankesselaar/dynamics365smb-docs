# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions. If you don't want to generate payment suggestions for a vendor, you shouldn't select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox. This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all purchase documents.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Enter and Post Cash and Bank/Giro Journals
The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## To post cash journals  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Date**|The journal entry date.|

    |**Description**|The description of the entry. This field automatically populates the description of the account number selected in the **Account No.** field.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code used to post the entry. You can select a code in this field only if the **Account Type** is **G/L Account**. For more information, see VAT Product Posting Groups.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br /><br /> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** check box.|  

4.  Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If there is a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

     The entries are posted to the general ledger. For more information, see General Ledger Entries.  

## To post bank or giro journals

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.

    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version
Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases are not included in this declaration. <br /><br />
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it is required that the merchandise have crossed the border physically. It is not enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. For more information, see the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  

- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. For more information, see [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## To prepare for electronic declaration
Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. A list of certificate providers can be found here: [https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  

    - Register a user of Digipoort, which can be done here: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).

    - Obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, which can be obtained at the Dutch Tax Administration website: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

2. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. For more information, see [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

3. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. For more information, see [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## To create an electronic declaration
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## To submit an electronic declaration
With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

3. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message will be displayed.

## To import a response message from the tax authorities
For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To process a response message from the tax authorities
When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data has been processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The processed information about the response message is displayed in the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

4. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT

# Import and reconcile bank statements
Banks provide electronic bank statements for all your financial interactions. You can import these statements into the bank or giro journals.  

The import bank statement is supported by the following protocols:  

- Rabobank mut.asc  
- Rabobank vvmut.ac  
- Rabobank ASCII  
- SEPA CAMT  

## To import and reconcile bank statements  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank/Giro Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Import Bank Statement** action, select the required import protocol, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3.  To reconcile the bank statements automatically when importing, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Automatic Reconciliation** check box.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This function does not work for bank statement files of type SEPA CAMT. Instead, use the **Match Automatically** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](../../bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  

4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
5.  To import the file that contains the electronic bank statement, specify the file name and path, and then choose the **Open** button.  

The electronic bank statement is imported into the bank or giro journals. For more information, see [Dutch Electronic Banking](dutch-electronic-banking.md).

# Docket Reports in the Dutch Version
The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount will be paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system will select the **Docket** check box on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  

- The payment is not based upon an invoice.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# CMR Notes in the Dutch Version
A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

 Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR Notes  
Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR note used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.       

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
>  CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

 The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it is not prescribed.  

 The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## To make an Audit file  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br /><br /> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you do not want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be .xaf.

# Dutch Electronic Banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment Files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct Debit Files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. For more information, see [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank Statement Import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

For more information, see [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).

# Italian VAT

Companies must pay VAT to the state for most purchased goods and services. VAT can be deducted if the goods or services purchased by a company are used in the production of its income.  

 In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can define periodic VAT reports on the **VAT Report** page. You can fill in the lines based on VAT entries, and then export the VAT report to the appropriate authorities.  

## VAT Codes and Rates

VAT codes and rates must be set up even though some transactions are not subject to VAT rates. There are also many VAT-liable operations that are subject to a zero VAT rate by provision of the law.  

The related VAT code is printed for each invoice line. Invoices for VAT transaction entries that are not subject to VAT rates must be recorded and printed with a note stating that VAT is not owed.  

### Computing VAT

VAT is computed for transactions to comply with the rules in effect on that the day the transactions occur. Thus, the date on which a transaction legally occurs must be tracked when recording transactions.  

### Dates

The date of issue is the document date and the date of registration is the posting date. Reporting date filters are based on the posting dates. This is changed from the previous behavior in which reporting date filters were based on the Operation Occurred Date.  

### Non-deductible VAT

VAT cannot be deducted for some purchases because of:  

- The type of goods or services purchased – VAT is fully or partially non-deductible by provision of the law on goods like cars, mobile phones, food purchased at restaurants, and so on.  

- Partially deductible pro-rated VAT – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between sales operations for which VAT is owed, and all operations performed. VAT exceeding this ratio cannot be deducted.  

## Service Tariffs

The European Union (EU) has issued directives that change the VAT reporting for cross-border trade of goods and services in the EU.  

In Italy, the EU sales list (Intrastat) and annual listing reports are updated to include services. This involves a change in the reporting format. A new table for service tariffs is added so that companies can classify services that must be included in the Intrastat report. Users must add the relevant service tariff to all documents that are for cross-border transactions. The service tariff specified on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab for the document can be modified in each line in the document.  

## VAT Transaction Reports

You must submit periodic reports to the tax authorities, which list transactions that include VAT with amounts over a specified threshold. The VAT transaction reports are created based on transactions with customers or vendors from a country/region that is outside the EU and is not listed as blocked according to Italian authorities. Transactions with customers or vendors from EU countries/regions are reported through **Intrastat** reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides support for the following transaction types:  

|**Transaction Type**|**Supported**|
|--------------------|-------------|  
|FE - Customer invoices (factures issued)|Yes|  
|FR - Vendor invoices (factures received)|Yes|  
|NE - Customer credit notes (notes issued)|Yes|  
|NR - Vendor credit notes (notes received)|Yes|  
|DF - Transactions without invoices (direct invoices) (customer)|No|  
|FN - Customers invoices, when customer is non-resident|Yes|  
|SE - Vendor invoices, when vendor is non-resident|Yes **Note:** The purchase of services is assumed, but differentiation between service and goods is left for the user to implement.|  

 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does not report the following types of transactions:  

- Prepayment invoices, because the total amount will be reported at the time of the final invoice.  

- Operations without an invoice, for example, VAT entries posted via general ledger accounts, because a VAT registration number, a fiscal code, or a customer or vendor reference is required for inclusion in a report.  

- Self-billed transactions, which are not supported.  

The VAT transactions reports include lines where the amount is over the threshold and lines that must be included for other legal reasons. The threshold amount is set by the Italian authorities.  

Document lines contain a field to indicate if the line must be included in the VAT transaction reports. The **Include in VAT Transac. Rep.** fields are selected automatically based on the day of the transaction and a comparison with the threshold amount for the calendar year. If sales lines are related to a blanket order, the threshold is compared to the amount for the blanket order. This only applies to sales line of type **Item**. For service lines, the comparison is made with the service contract amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos are included in the VAT transaction report if the customer or vendor is from a country/region that is outside the EU and is not listed as blocked.  

When you post credit memos, you must update the **Refers to Period** field to specify the relevant period. The VAT transaction reports will include credit memos where the **Refers to Period** field is set to **Current Calendar Year** or **Previous Calendar Year**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] adds credit memos to the VAT reports in different ways depending on the application status and the value of the **Refers to Period** field. The following table describes the scenarios.  

|Scenario|Impact|  
|--------------|------------|  
|A credit memo is applied to a single invoice.<br /><br /> The **Refers to Period** field is set to **Current Calendar Year**.|The **Invoice No.** field will be set to the document number of the invoice.<br /><br /> The **Invoice Date** field will be set to the date that is specified in the **Operation Occurred Date** field<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will deduct the credit memo amount from the amount of the original invoice. If the resulting amount is above the threshold, both the invoice and credit memo will be included in the VAT transactions report. If the resulting amount is below the threshold, neither invoice or credit memo will be included in the VAT transactions report.|  
|A credit memo is applied to multiple invoices, or it is not applied.<br /><br /> The **Refers to Period** field is set to **Current Calendar Year**.|The **Invoice Date** field will be set to the last day of the year that is specified in the **Operation Occurred Date** field. For example, if the **Operation Occurred Date** field is **07-11-11**, the **Invoice Date** field will be set to **31-12-11**.<br /><br /> Only the credit memo will be included in the VAT transactions report.|  
|A credit memo is applied to multiple invoices, or it is not applied.<br /><br /> The **Refers to Period** field is set to **Previous Calendar Year**.|The **Invoice Date** field will be set to the last day of the year before the date that is specified in the **Operation Occurred Date** field. For example, if the **Operation Occurred Date** field is **07-11-11**, the **Invoice Date** field will be set to **31-12-10**.<br /><br /> Only the credit memo will be included in the VAT transactions report.|  

When service contracts are compared with the threshold, the **Annual Amount** field is converted to your local currency (LCY). The conversion is based on the **Currency Code** field and the exchange rate on the date in the **Starting Date** field for the service contract.  

Transactions with reverse charges are not included in the VAT transaction reports. Transactions with prepayments are also not included in the VAT transaction reports.  

To prepare your data for these reports, you must set up VAT posting to include VAT transaction report amounts. When a transaction such as posting a sales invoice is made that uses this VAT posting setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] checks if the transaction meets the threshold amounts. The check is based on document lines because a document can contain lines that must be included in the VAT transaction report and lines that must be excluded. The VAT transaction reports must only contain the lines that must be submitted, so [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] compares amounts against the threshold for each line instead of for a document.  

You must submit a VAT transactions report electronically to the tax authorities. For more information, see [Create Electronic VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-create-electronic-vat-transactions-reports.md).

# Prepare for VAT transactions reports in the Italian version
You must submit periodic reports to the tax authorities to list all transactions that include VAT. The tax authority establishes the thresholds at which reporting is required. Currently, the threshold is set at zero, meaning that all transactions are to be reported. To prepare for these reports, you must set up VAT posting to include VAT transaction report amounts.  

## To set up VAT transaction amounts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **VAT Transaction Report Amount** action.  
3.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Individual Person**|Select if this customer is an individual person.|  
    |**Resident**|Specify if the customer is a resident in Italy.<br /><br /> If a customer isn't a resident, you must also specify a tax representative on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.|  
    |**First Name**|Specifies the first name of the person.|  
    |**Last Name**|Specifies the last name of the person.|  
    |**Date of Birth**|Specifies the date of birth of the person.|  
    |**Place of Birth**|Specifies the place of birth of the person.|  

3.  If the customer isn't resident in Italy and isn't an individual person, you must specify a tax representative for the customer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Before you can specify a tax representative, you must have created the tax representative as a contact.  

### To specify a tax representative for a non-resident customer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a customer.
2.  On the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Tax Representative Type**|Specifies if the tax representative is a customer or a contact. You must set this field to **Contact**.|  
    |**Tax Representative No.**|Specify the contact that is the tax representative for this customer.|  

    You set up information, so that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] tracks new transactions with VAT that meet the thresholds specified by the tax authorities. Before you create the first VAT transaction report, you should prepare the existing data. For more information, see [Update VAT Transactions Data](how-to-update-vat-transactions-data.md). You can then create VAT transactions reports. For more information, see [Create Electronic VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-create-electronic-vat-transactions-reports.md).

# Create Electronic VAT Transactions Reports in the Italian Version
You must create a list of transactions that include VAT with amounts over the current threshold on or before the specified occurrence date. You submit this report to the tax authorities.  

## To create a VAT transactions report  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Without Contract**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are not associated with a contract.|  
    |**Contract**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are associated with a contract.|  
    |**Other**|The VAT entries that resulted in this line are not associated with a special contract, such as ongoing maintenance or other exceptions.|  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the contract that the tax authorities are looking for can be blanket orders or service contracts. To identify if the VAT report line belongs to a blanket order or service contract, you can drill down to see the underlying VAT entries from the **Amount** field.  

Credit memos are included in the VAT transaction report if the customer or vendor is from a country/region that is outside the EU and not excluded. For more information, see [Italian VAT](italian-vat.md).  

Now that you have created the VAT report, you must submit it to the tax authorities. For more information, see [Export VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-export-vat-transactions-reports.md).

# Set Up Journal Templates and Batches
All European Union (EU) companies must submit Intrastat reports to the customs office, detailing their trade with other EU countries/regions for the current year. An Intrastat summary report is presented to the tax authorities monthly, quarterly, or yearly depending upon the company's business.  

You can print Intrastat reports on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batches** page based on Intrastat journal entries. You can manually place entries into the journal, or use a batch job to place the entries there. Before you can do this, you must set up Intrastat journal templates and batches.  

## To set up Intrastat journal templates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  To create a new Intrastat journal template, choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Intrastat Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

|Field|Description|

# Create Multiple Fixed Asset Cards in the Italian Version
You can create multiple fixed asset cards automatically during purchase invoice posting. For example, if your company purchases 200 computers of the same kind from the same vendor, you do not have to manually create a fixed asset card for each computer; the fixed asset cards can be created automatically.  

## To create multiple fixed asset cards  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Lists** action, and then choose the **Fixed Assets** action.  
3.  On the **Fixed Asset List** page, choose the **New** action.  
4.  On the **Fixed Asset Card** page, fill in the relevant fields.  

    You will use the value of the **No.** field when you generate the remaining fixed assets later.  

5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Create a new purchase order, or open the existing purchase order.  
7.  Expand the **Lines** FastTab.  
8.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Type**|Select **Fixed Asset**.|  
    |**No.**|Specify the fixed asset number.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** This should be the same fixed asset number that you entered in the **Fixed Asset** list.|  
    |**No. of Fixed Asset Cards**|Specify the relevant number of duplicates for your fixed asset.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** During invoice posting, duplicate fixed asset cards are automatically generated and added to the fixed asset list. The only difference between the duplicate fixed asset cards is the number assigned to each fixed asset.|  

9. Choose the **OK** button.

# Set up and print Intrastat reports for Italy

> [!NOTE]
> This article is based on new redesigned Intrastat experience with enhanced features available from the 2022 release wave 2. If you're using old functionality based on Intrastat journals, learn more about old Intrastat experience at the [Print Intrastat for Italy](intrastat-for-italy-old.md). The old feature isn't available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. 

You can print monthly and quarterly Intrastat reports and submit them to the authorities on a diskette by running the **Intrastat Make Disk Tax Auth** batch job. Information regarding the receipt and the delivery of goods is included automatically.  

## Set up Intrastat reporting

Learn more in [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md).

## Work with Intrastat reporting

Learn more in [Work with Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-report-intrastat.md).

## Local Italian functionalities

### Additional parameters

When you create new a **Intrastat Report**, you need to make another setup at the **Export Parameters** FastTab. You can choose the period for reporting choosing one of the following options at the **Periodicity** field: Month, Quarter, Year. You can also choose the **Type** - Purchases or Sales, to choose the type of item ledger entries to be included.  

You also need to enter the **File Disk No.** to specify the floppy disk number if you're creating a reporting disk. If you want to specify whether to include intra-community entries from drop shipment documents to **Intrastat Report**, you need to mark the **Include Intra-Community Entries** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you print, you can select the path and file name. If you do not specify this information, the file will be named **scambi.cee** and will print to the root of the C drive.  
    
### Corrective Intrastat report  

A corrective Intrastat report in Italy is a declaration submitted to correct errors or make adjustments to previously filed Intrastat reports.

To prepare corrective intrastat report, you previously must post the credit memo, and it must be applied to the posted invoice. Corrective credit memo can't be in the same period as original invoice.  

If you already posted and applied documents, you can prepare a new Intrastat report and mark the **Corrective Entry** field to specify if the Intrastat report has an adjusting entry, and also populate the **Corrected Intrastat Report No.** field to specify the corrected report.

# Issue Vendor Payments and Customer Bills

The vendor and customer bill pay feature supports SEPA-based formats in addition to Italian file formats. You can pay vendors according to the SEPA Credit Transfer standard and collect payment from customers according to the SEPA Direct Debit standard. The following procedure describes the process for sending a SEPA-based payment to a vendor. The steps are similar for collecting payment from a customer.  

Before starting the following procedure, make sure that information for your company's bank has been provided on the **Bank Account Card** page. On the card, include information for the following fields:  

- IBAN  
- SWIFT Code (optional)  
- Payment Export Format  
- SEPA CT Msg. ID No. Series  

In addition, there must be a posted purchased invoice against which you can send a payment.  

## To issue payment to a vendor  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.

5. On the **Transfer** FastTab, specify information for the **IBAN** field.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.  
7. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Bill Card**, and then choose the related link.  
8. Choose the **New** action.  
9. On the **General** FastTab, enter information in the following fields: **Bank Account No.** of the vendor and **Payment Method Code**.  
10. Choose the **Suggest Payment** action.
11. Set filters, as appropriate, and then choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.  
12. Choose the **Create List** action.
13. Choose the **Yes** button to send the bill payment.  
14. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Bill List Issued**, and choose the related link.
15. Select the bill payment that you issued from the list, and then choose the **Edit** action. The **Vendor Bill List Sent Card** page opens.  
16. To export the payment information, choose the **Export Bill List to File** action. You can review the xml file that was sent.  

    1. Export to File (for standard SEPA format files)

# Italian fixed assets
Fixed assets are properties owned by a company and used in the production of its income. Assets can be either tangible or intangible, and can be either durable or non-durable. Cars, machines, and furniture are examples of tangible assets. Startup costs and licenses are examples of intangible assets.  

The following features are added to the fixed assets functionality:  

- There are several types of depreciation available, including the following: anticipated, accelerated, and reduced.  
- Automatic creation of multiple fixed asset cards from an invoice.  
- A **Depreciation Book** report that displays depreciation by fixed asset type.  

Anticipated depreciation allows companies to delay payment of taxes on assets by using an augmented depreciation rate for the first three years. This augmented depreciation rate must be a maximum of twice the normal depreciation rate. Thereafter, the depreciation rate is halved for the first year, and then doubled for the remaining two years. For subsequent years, the depreciation follows the standard pattern.  

Accelerated depreciation allows companies that can demonstrate that an asset’s use is more intensive than that of a standard asset to use a higher depreciation rate for this asset. Accelerated depreciation allows companies to shorten the period of an asset’s depreciation.  

Reduced depreciation allows companies that can demonstrate that an asset’s use is less intense than that of a standard asset can use a lower depreciation rate for it, and recover the difference during the following fiscal years. Reduced depreciation allows companies to lengthen the period of an asset’s depreciation.

You can run the **Update VAT Transaction Data** report as a test before you change any data. When you verify that the filters meet your expectations and the requirements of the tax authorities, you should run the report again to make the appropriate changes to data.  

> [!CAUTION]  
>  Before you run the **Update VAT Transaction Data** report, you should activate the change log on the **Change Log Setup** page. Also, you should enable logging for modifications to the **Include in VAT Transac. Report** field on the **VAT Entry** table.

    |**Show List Only**|Select if you don't want to update data.<br /><br /> If you select this field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] prints a report so that you can verify the changes before data is modified. The report contains a line for each document where the VAT base is equal to or greater than the threshold amounts. **Warning:**  Don't select both this field and the **Set Include in VAT Transaction Report** field.|  
    |**Set Include in VAT Transaction Report**|Select to set the **Include in VAT Trans. Report** to **Yes** on all VAT entries where the amounts meet the threshold amounts that are specified in the VAT posting setup. **Warning:**  If you select this field, your data is updated.

# Italian Subcontracting
Companies contracted for production often outsource the production of components to subcontractors. In order to know how many components to transfer to the subcontractor, there is a link between the subcontractors' operations and the BOM. This facilitates Master Production Scheduling (MPS) and Material Requirements Planning (MRP), and enables contractors to manage their outsourced and subcontracted components.  

Special unit prices are often negotiated between main contractors and subcontractors, so an extra subcontracting price list is available.  

## Work in Progress  
You can send an item to a subcontractor and have the subcontractor return it as a Work in Progress (WIP) to the main contractor. You can also send and receive groups of items without forced reference to the item card.

# Vendor Payments and Customer Bills Overview in the Italian Version
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can manage automatic bills to customers and from vendors.  

In addition, the bill pay feature supports the issuance of payment in many formats, including SEPA Credit Transfer, SEPA Direct Debit, and Italian bill formats.  

## Customer Bills and Vendor Bills  
You can issue a document to your bank with the payment amounts that are due to vendors on or before a certain date. The bank will pay the amount on or before that date by transferring the money from your bank account to the vendor's bank account.  

Similarly, you can issue a billing document to your customers who have payments that are due on or before a certain date. The customers can pay the amount to your bank, which then transfers that amount to your bank account. The bill is then given to the customer as evidence of your receipt of the payment.  

Before you can process bills, you must add your bank information to the **Company Information** page. You must also create bill posting groups and assign a bill posting group to the bank account that you will use for automatic bills. For more information, see [Set Up Automatic Payments and Automatic Bills](how-to-set-up-automatic-payments-and-automatic-bills.md). Then, you can generate lists of customer bills and vendor bills and process them.

# Set up compressed depreciation of fixed assets
You can compress fixed asset depreciation into subclasses and choose to display only the total sum by subclass. You can choose to post only the depreciation totals of assets that are grouped by category. This is particularly important for companies that have multiple fixed assets divided into many individual items.  

When you calculate depreciation, one line is generated for each fixed asset. For example, posting depreciations for 100 assets generates 100 lines that are posted to both the general ledger and fixed asset ledger entries.  

## To set up compressed depreciation of fixed assets  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Depreciation Book List** page, select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  To post only the depreciation totals of assets that are grouped by category, on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Compress Depreciation** check box.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Multiple depreciation lines are then compressed in the general ledger and are displayed in a single entry that is divided by fixed asset categories.  

4.  Choose the **OK** button.

# Fiscal Inventory Valuation

You must submit an annual report that shows the monetary value of inventory items for the fiscal year. According to the Italian requirements for fiscal inventory valuation, you must calculate the following cost types:  

- Year average cost  
- Weighted average cost  
- First in, First Out (FIFO) cost  
- Last in, First Out (LIFO) cost  
- Discrete LIFO cost  

## Fiscal Inventory Valuation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]

Initially, you must set up the fiscal inventory valuation for all cost types on the **Item Costing Setup** page and the **Item Card** page. For more information, see [Set Up Fiscal Inventory Valuation](how-to-set-up-fiscal-inventory-valuation.md).  

When you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must enter the inventory item ledger entries for the first year in order to calculate the item’s valuation. You can do this in the **Before Start Item Cost** page.  

To calculate discrete LIFO cost, you must set up information on the **Item Card** page and the **Subcontracting Prices** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> The discrete LIFO cost can only be calculated for items for which the **Inventory Valuation** field is set to **Discrete LIFO** on the **Item Card** page.

After you set up the discrete LIFO cost calculation, you can post sales and purchase transactions based on year-end costs.  

## End of Year

At the end of the fiscal year, you can run the **Calculate End Year Costs** batch job to calculate the fiscal inventory value of each inventory item according to the required valuation methods. The results are shown in the **Item Cost History List** page. Then, you can run the **Fiscal Inventory Valuation** report and the **LIFO Valuation** report to show the inventory valuation.  

For year-end operations, such as calculating the profit and loss during a fiscal year, there is a definitive period and a non-definitive period. If the **Competence Year** field on the **Item Cost History List** page is equal to the fiscal year end date, it is a definitive period, and you cannot recalculate data for a definitive period. If the definitive data differs from the fiscal year end date, then it is a non-definitive period. There should be data for at least one non-definitive period to perform calculations or partial calculations.

# Export VAT transactions reports in the Italian version
After you create a report, you can release it, and then export it for the authorities. To change the report, make sure that the Modify Submitted Reports check box is enabled in the VAT Report Setup page. If it isn't, to change the report when you want to correct an error, you have to create a new report, add the report with the error in the original report number, and then create a corrective report. For more information, see [Correct VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-correct-vat-transactions-reports.md).  

It's only possible to change the lines and fields when the document has the status Open. In the Released status, only the receipt no. is available for change. In the Submitted status, all fields are locked.

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select an existing report or create a new report:  

    - Select the relevant VAT report from the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
    - Choose the **New** action, and create a new report. For more information, see [Create Electronic VAT Transactions Reports](how-to-create-electronic-vat-transactions-reports.md).  

3.  Review the transaction details. To exclude a line from being reported to the tax authority, on the line, clear the **Incl. in Report** check box. To see the VAT entries that the line is based on, choose the drill-down button in the **Amount** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can create an empty report, that is, a report that has no lines, in the case in which there are no transactions to report.  

4.  Choose the **Release** action. The **Status** field is updated to Released.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is valid and ready for submission. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes.  

    After you release a VAT report, you can't edit it. But, you can change the report by reopening it. Choose the **Reopen** action.  

5.  Choose the **Export** action. The **Export VAT Transactions** batch job opens.  
6.  Select the **Detailed Export** check box, depending on your needs. The field controls whether to export the data in detailed format or in aggregate. If aggregate, lines are further grouped by VAT registration number or fiscal code.  
7.  Choose the **OK** button.

    The VAT report is exported as a .ccf file. You can now submit the report to the tax authorities by using the tool from the Italian Revenue Agency. Use the guidelines provided by the authority. For more information, see the [Italian Revenue Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206524).  

    After you receive a response from the tax authorities, you must update the VAT report.  

8.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Tax Auth. Receipt No.** field, specify the receipt number that you received from the tax authorities. In the **Tax Auth. Doc. No.** field, specify the document number that you receive.  
9. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action to finalize the report. The **Status** field is updated to Submitted.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can modify a report that has the status of Submitted only if you have enabled the **Modify Submitted Reports** check box on the **VAT Report Setup** page.

This article provides information that will help you to get started with Electronic invoicing for Italy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

# Print and reprint GL books and VAT registers in the Italian version

The tax authorities require that you submit two fiscal reports that list all of the posted ledger entries, the **G/L Book - Print** report and the **VAT Register - Print** report. Each printed page must have its own progressive number, and therefore, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the last printed page number before you run these reports again.  

The following procedure describes how to print or reprint the **G/L Book - Print** report, but the same steps apply to printing or reprinting the **VAT Register - Print** report.  

## To print the general ledger book report  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Book - Print**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Report Type**|Select the type of report to create.<br /><br /> If you select **Reprint**, the **From Progressive No.** field becomes enabled.|  
    |**Starting Date**|Enter the first date in the period from which posted entries are shown.|  
    |**Ending Date**|Enter the last date in the period from which posted entries are shown.|  
    |**From Progressive No.**|Specifies the progressive number for the report.|  
    |**Print Company Information**|Select to print company information on the report.<br /><br /> The remaining fields are populated based on the **Company Information** page.|  

    When you print the report, you are reminded to update the **General Ledger Setup** page with the page number on the last page.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does not save the page number automatically when you run the reports. After you run the G/L Book - Print report or the VAT Register - Print report, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the last printed page number..  

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

    To set the last printed page number for the VAT register report, search for **VAT Register**, and choose the link for the page under **VAT Posting Group**.  

4. In the **Fiscal Reporting** FastTab, in the **Last Printed G/L Book Page** field, specify the page number that is on the last page of the **G/L Book - Print** report that you printed.  

Both official reports can be reprinted. When you reprint a report, the first page of the report must have the same page number as it did when the report was printed the first time. If you want to reprint one of the reports, and the page number is incorrect, you can change the reprinting information for the report  

The following procedure describes how to view or change the page numbering for previously printed versions of the **G/L Book - Print** report, but the same steps apply to the **VAT Register - Print** report.  

## To view or change page numbers for reprinting the general ledger book report  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Change G/L Book Reprint Info.** action. On the **G/L Book Reprint Info** page, the **First Page Number** field specifies the first page number of the previously printed reports.  

When you update the **General Ledger Setup** page or the **VAT Registers** page with the page number of the last page of the printed report, make sure that you specify the correct page number. If the reprinted report starts with the wrong page number, the tax authorities won't accept the report. The **G/L Book Reprint Info** page and the **VAT Register Reprint Info** can help you identify the correct page number.

# Set Up Payment Terms in the Italian Version

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. For each payment term, you can specify if the payment can be made in installments. For example, you can define that a payment can be made in three installments with a third of the payment due after 30, 60, and 90 days.  

If a payment term must be paid in one installment, you must still specify how the due date will be calculated.  

When you first sign up for [[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Calculation** action.  
4. On the **Payment Terms Lines** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Payment %**|Specify the percentage of the total payment that this installment is for.<br /><br /> For example, if the payment must be made in one installment, enter **100**.|  
    |**Due Date Calculation**|Specify the formula that is used to calculate the date that a payment must be made.<br /><br /> For example, if the payment must be made in one installment after two weeks, enter **14D**. For more information, see [Use Date Formulas](../../ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas)|  
    |**Discount Date Calculation**|Specify the formula that is used to calculate the date that a payment must be made in order to obtain a discount.|  
    |**Discount %**|Specify the discount percentage that is applied for early payment of an invoice amount.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button.  

The **Payment Nos.** field on the **Payment Terms** page is updated. The payment terms that you set here will be a reference for automatic due date calculation for documents that you post for relevant customers and vendors.  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.

# Create a VAT statement

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to submit a periodic report of VAT transactions. The VAT statement is submitted as an FDF file that corresponds with an editable PDF file from the tax authorities.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As of July 1st 2020, the Austrian authorities changed VAT on certain hospitality services to 5% as a temporary measure part of a plan to stimulate the economy in areas that are hit hard by COVID-19. If you have customers or vendors in the impacted areas, you must create VAT posting groups that reflect the correct VAT rate and use these for transactions created on or after July 1st 2020. To make sure that the new 5% VAT transactions get included correctly in the VAT statements, run the **Update VAT Statement** action from the **Search** field. This rebuilds the VAT statement and includes the 5% transactions, ready for reporting in the corresponding box in the official VAT statement PDF template. Additionally, make sure that you acquire the official PDF template to use for VAT reporting.  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must fill in detailed information about your company address in the **Company Information** page before you create the VAT statement. This includes information about street, building, floor, and room number. This information is included in the FDF file.  

## Create a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement AT**, and then choose the related link.

# Swiss Electronic Payments

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to send invoices to customers electronically. The invoices are presented and paid directly using the customer's online banking software.  

## Electronic Payment Methods

You can make electronic payments by using the following methods:  

- Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR)  
- Lastschrift Verfahren (LSV+)  
- SEPA credit transfers  

## ESR

ESR is an electronic debtor service that uses payment slips to collect money. It is the standard electronic payment system created by Swiss Post. You can print ESR payment slips as invoice attachments, calculate ESR reference numbers, and import ESR files that have payment information from banks. For more information, see [Swiss Electronic Payments Using ESR](how-to-print-esr-invoices.md). You can also make ESR and ESR+ payments using the bank's version of this payment method, which is named Bank-ESR (BESR).  

## LSV+

LSV+ is a direct debit service that is used for processing payments. Companies can release customer payments directly from the customer's bank using direct debit. You can request and collect customer payments using direct debit in the LSV+ bank format, or in the DebitDirect PostFinance format. For more information, see [Swiss Electronic Payments Using LSV+](swiss-electronic-payments-using-lsv-.md).  

## SEPA Credit Transfers

To export payments according to the SEPA standard, you must use a bank account. On those bank accounts, the **Bank Acc. Posting Group** field must specify the relevant general ledger account. This way, the related general ledger entries will be consistent with the entries that are generated for the Swiss payment methods. For more information about how to export SEPA payments, see [Create SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File](../../finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md#creating-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-and-export-to-a-bank-file).  

### <a name="iban-qr"></a>IBAN and QR-IBAN

In Switzerland, requests for payments based on SEPA credit transfers can include a regular IBAN code for the bank account or a QR-IBAN code. For more information, see [QR-Bill Management](ui-extensions-qr-bill-management.md).  

The IBAN type on the recipient bank account must match the payment reference type on the entry when you try to pay a vendor. If the payment reference is a QR reference, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will check that the IBAN on the vendor bank account is a QR-IBAN code. If the payment reference is a creditor reference, that IBAN must be a normal IBAN.  

> [!TIP]
> If a vendor uses both types of accounts regularly, create multiple vendor bank accounts and use them accordingly. For more information, see [Using multiple bank accounts as issuers of QR-Bills](ui-extensions-qr-bill-management.md#multiplebankaccounts).

# Import Swiss Bank Clearing Numbers in the Swiss Version

Bank clearing numbers are unique numbers used to identify each bank agency or branch in the bank directory. This information is required for electronic payment. The file can be downloaded from the [SIX Interbank Clearing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145121) website.  

You can import the BC Bank Master .txt file—the official Swiss bank clearing number file—to update the bank clearing number information in the bank directory. When you import the bank clearing number file, the data is imported to the **Bank Directory** table, and the existing data is overwritten. After importing the bank clearing number file, you can define the updated bank branch number for customers and vendors. For more information, see the Customer Bank Account table and the Vendor Bank Account table.  

## To import Swiss bank clearing numbers  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Directory**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import Bank Directory** action.  
3. Choose the **...** button to open the .txt bank clearing number file.
4. On the **Import Bank Directory** page, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Automatically Update Clearing Numbers** field to update the bank clearing numbers automatically.  
5. Choose the **Print** button or the **Preview** button to import the bank clearing numbers, and then, on the **Open** page, locate the file that you have downloaded from the SIX Interbank Clearing website.
6. Choose the **Open** button.  

   If you choose the **Print** button, the contents of the file will be printed. If you choose the **Preview** button, the **Bank Directory** table will be updated and a report that has clearing numbers that have changed will be displayed.  

The following procedure describes how to define bank branch numbers for customer bank accounts. The same steps also apply for defining bank branch numbers for vendor bank accounts.  

## To define bank branch numbers for customer bank accounts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the customer for whom you want to create bank account information, and then choose the **Bank Accounts** action.  
3. On the **Customer Bank Account List** page, select the required bank account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Bank Branch No.** field, select the number of the bank agency or branch.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

# General ledger balance in the Swiss version

When you choose the **Balance** action on the **G/L Accounts** page, the **G/L Acc. Provisional Balance** page opens. It shows the balance of the final posted ledger entries and the balance of the postings entered in the current general journal.  

The journal balance references all lines from the beginning of the journal up to and including the current line.

For example, after recording customer payments you can check whether the bank balance is correct.

You can choose between two options:

* **All Journals**

    The unposted balance for all general ledger registers is calculated. It also includes values from ledgers that have another journal name not shown at the time.

* **Actual Journal**

    The unposted balance for the currently displayed general journal only is calculated.

# Close an LSV Collection in the Swiss Version
You must close Lastschrift Verfahren (LSV+) collections to write LSV files that can be sent to the bank for payment collection. When you close a collection, the collection is complete, and the postings in the LSV journal are combined.  

When the collection is complete, the current collection number is assigned in the LSV journal, based on the last collection. This LSV number is transferred to the customer entries for all outstanding invoices. The collection file can be reconstructed at any time using the LSV number. The **On Hold** field is also populated with **LSV** in the customer entries to avoid the duplication of open entries. For more information, see the **LSV Journal** table and the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table. You can also reopen a closed collection.  

## To close an LSV collection  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **LSV Journal List**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the required journal line, and then choose the **Modify Posting Date** action. This will modify the value in the **Credit Date** field by using the value suggested during the LSV collection.  
3.  In the **New Date** field, enter the new date.  
4.  Choose the **Close Collection* action*.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The fields on the **Options** FastTab for the **LSV Close Collection** batch job cannot be modified, and correspond to the selected journal line.  

5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **LSV Journal List** page, the value in the **LSV Status** field is changed from **Edit** to **Released**. The journal lines can no longer be modified.  

## To reopen an LSV collection  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **LSV Journal List**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the required journal line for which you want to reopen the collection, on then choose the **Reopen Collection** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only reopen the collection if you have not yet submitted the LSV+ file to the bank.  

3.  Choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reopening of the collection.

# Import ESR Payments in the Swiss Version
After you receive payment from a customer, you receive a file that contains information about paid invoices. You can receive this file from your bank electronically, or by mail.  

You can import the Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) invoice data from the file, print the data by using the sales invoice ESR report or the sales ESR coupon report, and verify before posting. For more information, see [Print ESR Invoices](how-to-print-esr-invoices.md).  

## To import ESR payments  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The journal must be empty before you import the ESR file. You cannot import more than one ESR file into the same cash receipt journal.  

3.  Choose the **Read ESR File** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have defined more than one ESR bank, a warning message displays instructing you to choose the relevant bank. For more information, see the ESR Setup table.  

4.  Choose the **Yes** button, and then choose the **OK** button.  

The payments information is imported to the journal lines. The payments are automatically applied to the respective invoices according to unique ESR reference numbers.

# QR-Bill Management in the Swiss Version of Business Central

Since July 1, 2020, companies in Switzerland must be able to receive QR-bills. QR-bills are payment slips that follow invoices, and are part of a country-wide initiative to streamline payment processes. QR-bills replace all existing payment slips and ESR-related functionality. They contain all the information needed to make payments, and a QR code on the payment slip makes it easy to import the information into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. All relevant information is imported and used to generate payments for the vendor who sent the QR-bill, including the payment reference, which automatically gets included in vendor ledger entries and exported in payment files to the bank.

## <a name="get-started"></a>Get started with the QR-Bill Management extension

The QR-Bill Management extension is included and automatically installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. To get started with the extension, you must make a few configuration changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. An easy way to do that is to choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **QR-Bill Setup**, and then choose the related link. The guide helps you enter information, such as:

* Specify whether to use your IBAN or QR-IBAN. QR-IBAN is an IBAN that contains a number between 30000 and 31999 on positions 5 to 9, such as *CH55 30024 123456789012*.
* Define how to display names and addresses on QR-bills, and how to use the German Umlaut Chars Encoding. (We recommend you use the default values.)
* Select the **Default QR-Bill Layout**. The layout determines whether to use IBAN or QR-IBAN, whether the reference type is creditor or QR reference, and whether to include billing information in the SWICO format.
* Enable sales and service invoice types and payment methods for QR-bills.
* Specify the journal template and journal batch to use when generating purchase journals from scanned or imported QR-bills.

If needed, you can change the layout settings on the **QR-Bill Layout** page.

## Issuing QR-bills

You can enable QR-bills for sales and service invoices. This option adds an entry to the **Report Selection - Sales** page that generates an extra PDF with the QR-bill when invoices are generated. To enable the feature, choose the **Document Types Enabled for QR-Bills** field on the **QR-Bill Setup** page, and activate the desired document types by selecting the appropriate box in the **Enabled** column.

## Adding billing information to QR-bills

When you create a QR-bill you can include billing information in the SWICO format, as advocated by SIX, the Swiss payment infrastructure provider. Ideally, business applications that produce or import QR-bills should also be able to process information such as the VAT amount, the vendor's invoice number, and so on, because it can be valuable for the payable invoice. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], we import this information but use only the vendor's invoice number. You need to customize if you want to include other information.

## Understanding the payment reference

Payment processes are all about paying the right amount to the right party, and making it easy for them to reconcile payments to close outstanding accounts. The QR-Bill Management extension handles these processes by generating a payment reference for QR-bills that is unique to invoices issued in a specific company, which means the same payment reference cannot be issued more than once.  

If your customer is also using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the payment reference is imported when receiving QR-bills, transferred to their **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, and used as a reference when creating vendor payments. Learn more at [Receiving QR-Bills](ui-extensions-qr-bill-management.md#receiving-qr-bills).

The flow is similar to the previous ESR reference functionality that QR-bills are replacing. Eventually, payment files (pain.001) are sent from the customer's business app to their bank with the message to transfer the amounts to the vendor's account. The bank then produces a customer statement file (camt.054) that the vendor can import to reconcile accounts. This file includes the payment reference and is imported through the Data Exchange Framework that is updated by the QR-Bill Management extension to import camt.054 files.

For ESR references, you can configure information, for example, so they include the customer number and invoice number. You cannot configure the payment reference in QR-bills. There will always be a 1:1 relation between an issued QR-bill and a payment, which makes reconciliation easy and eliminates the need to configure the payment reference on QR-bills. Instead, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses a unique counter for the payment reference. Additionally, logic is in place to block the import or scan of the same payment reference twice.

### <a name="formats"></a>Formats for QR references and creditor references

The QR reference consists of 26 numerical positions plus a check digit.  

The ISO Creditor Reference (ISO 11649) enables the creditor to make automatic comparisons between their bills and the incoming payments. It must include the value *RF* in positions 1-2 and a correct test character in positions 3-4, and can include up to a maximum of 25 characters.  

## <a name="multiplebankaccounts"></a>Using multiple bank accounts as issuers of QR-bills

Issuers of QR-Bills can use multiple bank accounts to route payments into different bank accounts. This is tied to the payment method where you specify the **QR-Bill Bank Account No.** When specified, the IBAN/QR-IBAN information from this bank account will be used on QR-bills that use the given payment method. This way you can route incoming payments into the desired bank account. If you do not use multiple bank accounts and specify the **QR-Bill Bank Account No.** on the **Payment Methods** card, the QR-IBAN/IBAN information from the **Company Information** page is used on QR-Bills instead. Make sure you have at least your primary bank account information set up there. Learn more at [Set Up Bank Accounts](../../bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an issuer of QR-bills, set up your bank accounts so the right accounts display to your customers, depending on if you use QR-IBANs or regular IBANs. If you are a receiver and payer of QR-bills, we recommend you set up vendor bank accounts correctly for payment and transfer to accounts with either regular IBANs or QR-IBANs.

### Adding a QR-IBAN to a new or existing bank account

To use a QR-IBAN different from the one set in the **Company Information** page, specify the bank account information in the **Bank Account Card**:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Payment Methods** list, choose the **New** or **Edit** action.
3. On the **Transfer** FastTab, enter the bank account in the **QR-IBAN** field.

## Scanning and importing QR-bills

To scan or import a QR-bill, you must use one of the following types of scanning devices:

* An input scanner that decodes the QR code and simulates the keyboard to paste the decoded value directly in a field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].
* A scanner that can decode the QR code and save it to a .txt file you import to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot import QR-bills received as PDF files directly into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] cannot interpret QR codes. You must use one of the above-referenced scanning methods.

## Receiving QR-bills

You can receive QR-bills in several places in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]:

* **Incoming Documents**, when you want a QR-bill to initiate the creation of a new purchase document or purchase journal.
* **Purchase Orders and Purchase Invoices**, when you want to import information from a QR-bill to an existing purchase document and use it to validate the amount and currency and to store the payment reference.
* **Purchase Journals**, when you want to create new purchase journal lines based on QR-bills. 

### Receiving a QR-bill through an incoming document

Receiving a QR-bill through incoming documents is especially useful when the process is automated, but you can also manually receive a QR-bill through incoming documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Incoming Documents** list, create a new entry by choosing **New**, and then **New**.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, enter a description in the **Description** field.
4. To import the QR-bill, choose one of the following actions:
   * **Scan QR-Bill** to scan a QR-bill into the incoming document entry.
   * **Import Scanned QR-Bill File** to use a file generated by the second scanner type described in the [Scanning and importing QR-bills](#scanning-and-importing-qr-bills) section.

> [!TIP]
> After you import the QR-bill, you can check for errors on the **Matching Details** FastTab.

From the incoming document you can create a purchase journal or a purchase invoice, and the payment reference from the QR-bill is assigned to both. Learn more at [Working with Incoming Documents](../../across-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you import QR-bills, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will look for a vendor bank account that has a matching IBAN or QR-IBAN. When you import QR-bills on incoming documents, a document or purchase journal is created and the vendor bank account determines the vendor to use. The incoming document approach helps ensure that the correct vendor is assigned. 

#### Receiving through the Kofax OCR service

> [!NOTE]
> If existing companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] want a QR reference to be returned when they use the Kofax OCR service, they must update the existing data exchange definition that's used as **Data Exchange Type** for processing invoices in incoming documents.  

Complete the following steps to update an existing data exchange definition. 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Data Exchange Definitions** list, find the line you want to update, and open the card. 
3. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **OCRINVHEADER**.  
4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, create a new line, and enter the following values.

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Column No.** | 11513 |
    | **Name** | Swiss QR-Bill Reference No. |
    | **Description** | Swiss QR-Bill Reference No. |
    | **Path** | /Document/HeaderFields/HeaderField\[Type\[text()='qrreference'\]\]/Text |
    
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.  
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new line, and enter the following values.

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Column No.** | 11513 |
    | **Target Table ID** | 38 |
    | **Target Field ID** | 171 |
    | **Validate Only** | False |

7. Close the pages.  

### Receiving a QR-bill through purchase orders or purchase invoices

Receiving a QR-bill through a purchase order or purchase invoice validates the invoice amount and adds the payment reference to the ledgers. Like incoming documents, you can scan or import a QR-bill to an existing purchase order or invoice. This process uses the QR-IBAN or IBAN from the QR-bill to find the vendor with a matching number. If no match is found you cannot scan or import the QR-bill, so you'll need to create the vendor bank account and then allow the QR-bill to be attached to the purchase document.

* To add a QR-bill to an existing purchase document, select the target document and then choose either the **Scan QR-Bill** or the **Import Scanned QR-Bill File** action on either the **Purchase Orders** or **Purchase Invoices** page.

When the QR-bill is scanned or imported to the purchase document, the amount, payment reference, and other information from the QR-bill are added. This data is used to validate the purchase document before it's posted. Posting is blocked if the amount on the order or invoice doesn't match the amount on the QR-bill. Validation also happens when you scan or import the QR-bill. If you upload the QR-Bill that doesn't contain the **Amount**, for example if the decoded QR-Bill has a blank line where amount should be, after you upload, the **QR-Bill** section is shown on the **Purchase Invoice** page. The **Amount** field of the **QR-Bill** section can be edited and you can add the appropriate amount to this field. If an uploaded QR-Bill does have value in the **Amount** field, it's automatically set to the **Amount** field of the **QR-Bill** section, but the field can still be edited.  

If the payment reference is already in use on a vendor ledger entry for a vendor, an error occurs. Vendors can't issue multiple QR-bills with the same payment reference. Similarly, an error occurs if the QR-bill and payment reference have already been imported to an open purchase document.

### Receiving a QR-bill through a purchase journal

You can scan or import QR-bills directly into a purchase journal. This option is useful when you want to create new journal lines based on a QR-bill. Scanning or importing directly into a purchase journal creates a new **Purchase Journal Line** using the vendor and amount from the QR-bill, and tries to identify the vendor by finding a **Vendor Bank Account** containing a matching IBAN or QR-IBAN. For example, using purchase journals is useful if you don't want to use purchase orders or invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Purchase Journals** list, create a new entry by choosing one of the following actions:
   * **Scan QR-Bill** to scan a QR-bill into the incoming document entry.
   * **Import Scanned QR-Bill File** to use the file generated by the second scanner type described in the [Scanning and importing QR-bills](#scanning-and-importing-qr-bills) section.

## Reconciliation

When importing bank transactions (camt) on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, it's assumed the file includes the payment reference and the corresponding **Customer Ledger Entries** is automatically found to settle the transaction.

# Swiss Purchase Documents and Sales Documents
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Swiss enhancements to purchase documents and sales documents. This includes the following:  

- Enhanced posting descriptions for general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries. For more information, see the G/L Entry table, the Cust. Ledger Entry table, and the Vendor Ledger Entry table.  
- The ability to have subtitles, subtotals, and begin and end totals in sales quotes and sales orders.  
- The ability to round invoice totals in payment journal lines if there is a payment discount.  
- The ability to turn off printing of additional shipment documents for purchase invoices and sales invoices.  

## Purchase Documents and Sales Documents  
The posting descriptions posted to ledger entries for purchase orders and sales orders display the name of the vendors or customers, and the invoices or credit memo numbers. For example, **Inv. 103020/ The Cannon Group PLC** is a posting description. This posting description displays a number that is relevant for financial transactions, which helps to analyze the transactions more easily.  

### Sales Quotes and Sales Orders  
When a sales quote or sales order is created, if the type of the sales quote line or sales order line is **Begin Total** or **End Total**, then the items listed on the lines are marked as physical items or as service items. The items then have subheadings for each item group, and a subtotal is created for each item group.  

The items are divided based on the system generated values displayed in the **Level** field.  

You can specify an item as a variant in the sales quote line. This allows you to list the alternative items without including the price in the quote. You can also refer to specific parts of a sales quote or sales order based on the value displayed in the **Position** field of the sales quote line or the sales order line. For more information, see the Sales Line table.  

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Purchase Invoices and Sales Invoices with Payment Discounts  
For purchase invoices and sales invoices, the invoice amount is reduced by the discount amount, and then rounded. The invoice total is also rounded if there is a discount. For more information, see the General Ledger Setup table.  

## Shipment Documents  
On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the **Shipment on Ship and Invoice** field is used to turn off printing of additional shipment documents for purchase invoices and sales invoices. When you post an order, a posted shipment and a posted invoice are automatically created. If the printed invoice is also used as a shipment document, additional shipment documentation does not need to be printed. You can turn off printing of additional shipment documents for purchase invoices and sales invoices by clearing the **Shipment on Ship and Invoice** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. For more information, see the Sales & Receivables Setup table.

# Swiss Electronic Payments Using ESR in the Swiss Version
The Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) electronic payment method is an electronic debtor service that allows the customer to bill open invoices in Swiss Francs (CHF) and Euros (EUR), and to post incoming payments efficiently. The reference number, or code line, contains all relevant bookkeeping data.  

With ESR electronic payments, you can do the following:  

- Send ESR payment slips with unique reference numbers on the invoices. Because of the unique ESR reference numbers, the payments for settlement are automatically applied to the related invoices. For more information, see [Print ESR Invoices](how-to-print-esr-invoices.md).  

- Download the ESR files from the bank daily. The files contain information about all paid invoices.  

- Import the ESR files and create payment lines automatically for each payment. For more information, see [Import ESR Payments](how-to-import-esr-payments.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can use the ESR module, you must set up the bank, bank account, and file name. You must also specify whether ESR or ESR+ should be used.

When you have evaluated the setup information, you can adjust the invoice form, and you can create a test series that you can ask your bank or postal service to validate.  

When you set up number series for invoices, you must follow these guidelines:  

- Use a maximum of eight digits.  
- Use only numeric characters.  
- Do not precede numbers with zeros.

# Swiss Value Added Tax

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following enhancements to Swiss VAT reporting:  

- Automatic adjustment of VAT amounts for invoices, according to payment discounts.  
- Additional VAT exchange rates for invoices in foreign currencies.  

For more information about Swiss VAT reporting and coding requirements, see [Swiss VAT Information](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/en/home/value-added-tax.html). The information is available in French, German, and Italian, as well as English.  

## VAT Amounts and VAT Exchange Rates

According to local VAT laws, the VAT base amount for an invoice can be reduced by the payment discount if a discount is granted. To allow automatic VAT adjustment for a payment discount on an invoice, the **Adjust for Payment Discount** field is activated by default on the **General Ledger Setup** page. You can also activate this function in the VAT posting setup. For more information, see the General Ledger Setup table and the VAT Posting Setup table.  

### Currency Exchange Rates for VAT Reporting

For invoices in foreign currency, you must use the official exchange rate provided by the government for the VAT calculation itself. You can also set up additional exchange rates for VAT, which you can use for aspects of the invoice other than the VAT calculation. You can provide the correct government VAT exchange rate for each relevant foreign currency in the exchange rate setup for invoices. For more information, see the Currency Exchange Rate table.  

You can also adjust all VAT amounts in VAT entries that result from foreign currency transactions. When you activate the adjust VAT exchange rate function, VAT exchange rates are adjusted automatically. The positive differences that result from exchange rates are posted to exchange rate gain accounts. The negative differences that result from exchange rates are posted to exchange rate loss accounts. For more information, see the Adjust Exchange Rates batch job.  

Additional information, such as VAT rate and original currency amount, is transferred to the VAT entries. For more information, see the VAT Entry table.

# Swiss inventory management
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Swiss enhancements to inventory management. This includes the following:  

- Detailed reporting.  For more information, see the Inventory - Sales Statistics report and the Inventory - List report.  
- The ability to track an invoice with multiple shipments.  
- Including an item card location code as the default location code for sales lines and item journals. For more information, see [Set Up Locations](../../inventory-how-setup-locations.md).

## Managing item details  
Companies can have different warehouses for different product categories. In such cases, you must use the default location code retrieved from the item card. When you define a location code for an item, it's transferred to the sales lines and item journals as a default item location code. For more information, see the Sales Line and the Item Journal Line table.  

Additional information, such as customer number, ship-to address code, and customer sales person code, is stored in item ledger entries. This information helps you to create customized reporting criteria, such as revenue per customer, and item or sales provisions for sales people. For more information, see the Item Ledger Entry table.  

## Invoices with multiple shipments  
If multiple shipments are posted for a customer, then you can create a combined invoice with the **Get Shipment Lines** function. For more information, see the Get Shipment Lines page. When you use this function, the text created on the invoice lines includes information about the shipment number and the shipment date. For example, the text could appear as Shipment No. 102040 of 25.01.01. This allows you to easily track invoices with multiple shipments.

# Adjust Exchange Rates in the Swiss Version
If you have taxable sales in a foreign currency, you must use the official rate for VAT currency conversion as set by the Federal Tax Administration.  

If these rates do not match the currency rates used in the purchase or sales invoices, you will have to adjust the VAT rates with a batch job later. These adjustments can only be run using an authorized VAT rate.  

You can run this batch job as often as you like, however make sure that you always run it before creating a VAT statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When using a report currency, make sure that the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is set to **No Adjustment**.  

For more information about VAT and foreign currencies, see the [ESTV](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=285999) website.  

## To adjust an exchange rate

# Swiss electronic payments using LSV+ in the Swiss version
The Lastschrift Verfahren (LSV+)—or direct debit—electronic payment method, an improved version of LSV, allows companies to retrieve payments directly from its customers’ bank accounts. To retrieve customer payments, you must send an LSV file to the bank, and the bank will collect the payments requested in the file.  

The LSV+ method is a direct debit principle with right of objection. Business Direct Debit (BDD) is a direct debit system without right of objection. The file format to be sent to the bank is the same for LSV+ and BDD.  

Before using the LSV module, you must define the settings on the **LSV Setup** page.

## Automatic ESR processing  
You can download payment credit transactions in Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) file format from the bank. You can receive processed LSV payments in the ESR file if the ESR reference number is integrated with the LSV+ system. If LSV+ payments are included in your imported LSV files, the related LSV journal lines are closed automatically. Automatic ESR processing is performed only for payments that use Swiss Francs (CHF), and requires that you do the following:  

- After you have sent the LSV+ file to the bank, submit a payments report within three business days following the requested LSV processing date.  

- Import the ESR files, and post the ESR journals. If an imported ESR transaction is related to an open LSV+ payment line, then the appropriate LSV journal line is automatically closed by ESR.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When importing an ESR file, the LSV journal line is closed by ESR if the appropriate LSV journal is found, regardless of the ESR transaction type.  

- After the LSV processing date, you can check the LSV journal lines. If all of the LSV journal lines are closed, then the status of the **LSV Status** field is updated to  **Finished**.

# Swiss General Ledger Accounts
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Swiss enhancements to general ledger accounts.

- Maintain the foreign currency balances of a bank account in the general ledger.  
- Sort general ledger account numbers on the **Chart of Accounts** page.  
- Preview the effects that posting general journals would have on the balances of certain general ledger accounts before actually posting them.  

## General Ledger Accounts and General Journals  
Companies often have different bank accounts for foreign currencies, and have a general ledger account for each bank account. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up currency code and foreign currency balance information on the **Chart of Accounts** page. This allows you to maintain the original foreign currency balance of a bank account. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the COA](../../finance-general-ledger.md).  

For example, a company has two bank accounts: one for local currency (LCY) and one for euros (EUR). You must create a general ledger account for each bank account. For the EUR account, define the currency code as **EUR** and post journals in EUR or LCY.  

When the exchange rate for EUR and LCY changes, you can update and adjust the local currency balance for the EUR general ledger account using the adjust exchange rates batch job. This batch job creates and posts currency adjustment entries to the general ledger and updates the LCY balance.  

## Data Type for General Ledger Accounts  
The data type is set to text for the general ledger account number or account code to support the sorting requirements for the standardized Swiss Kontenrahmen Käfer (KMU) common chart of accounts. The account numbers list is sorted based on the text data type. The KMU chart of accounts contains the following account numbers:  

- 1176  
- 119.0  
- 1190  

## Viewing Temporary Balances in General Journals  
Before posting a general journal you can preview the effect that posting would have on the balances of certain general ledger accounts. You can open a statistics page that shows the balances of the accounts, and the balances of the active lines that included the unposted values for the current journal. For more information, see [View Temporary Balances in General Ledger Journals](how-to-view-temporary-balances-in-general-ledger-journals.md).

# Print ESR invoices in the Swiss version

You can print an Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) payment slip in the following ways:  

- As part of the sales invoice ESR.  
- As a separate document called an ESR coupon.  

The sales invoice ESR report corresponds with the sales invoice that is accompanied by an additional ESR coupon. By using the sales ESR coupon report, you can print the blue deposit slip.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must select a printer and select settings during the ESR payment module installation to print the deposit slip correctly. For more information, see the Printer Selection table.  

The following procedure describes how to print ESR sales invoices, but the same steps also apply for printing ESR coupons.  

## To print ESR invoices  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Invoice ESR**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Sales Invoice ESR** batch job, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No. of copies**|Enter the required number of report copies.|  
    |**ESR Bank**|Select the ESR bank code that is to be printed in the report.<br /><br /> If the value in this field is \<Blank\> and the ESR payment method code isn't defined on the **ESR Setup** page, then the ESR main bank selected on the **ESR Setup** page will be printed.|  
    |**LogInteraction**|Specify if the interactions that you have with your contacts will be logged.|  
    |**ESR System**|Select the ESR system through which you can send new ESR coupons to customers. To use the ESR system that is used by the bank that you specify in **ESR Bank** field, select **Based on ESR Bank**.|  

3. Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

You can also reprint the sales invoice ESR report or sales ESR coupon report.

# Submit and report the IRS 1099 forms

This article guides users on how to report and submit IRS 1099 forms using Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## Register with the IRS  

You can't print 1099 reports directly on preprinted forms. You can submit 1099 forms using magnetic media or through integration with the IRIS. If you prefer to manually populate your 1099 forms, you can gather all necessary information from the **IRS 1099 Form Documents** and fill them out manually, outside of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

You can print or email 1099 copy substitutes to your vendors, including all the details the original form requires.

### Submit using integration with IRIS  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integration via IRIS APIs will be available in one of the upcoming minor releases.  

After you submit the document to the IRS by using the API, the status of the **IRS 1099 Form Document** changes to **Submitted**.  

> [!NOTE]
> More details about the integration will be available when we deliver the new feature.  

### Submit using magnetic media  

Submitting 1099 forms as magnetic media using the FIRE portal is optional for cloud users. However, it's the only available option for on-premises users because the Microsoft security certificate for A2A communication can only be used in the cloud.  

To prepare magnetic media for submission, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS 1099 FIRE**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the request page, specify the tax year for the 1099 forms that you want to report in the **Calendar Year** field, and the control code of the transmitter that is used to electronically file 1099 forms in the **Transmitter Control Code** field.
1. Fill in the other fields as necessary, and choose **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to test this functionality, select the **Test File** field to print a test file.  

## Print the document  

After calculation, you can use the **Print** action to print the document. When you print the report, you can choose which copy to print. You have the following options:  

- Copy B is for the vendor.
- Copy C is for the sender.
- Copy 2 is the second copy for the vendor.

## Email automation

### Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> You can't send the document via email if its **Status** isn't **Submitted**. This restriction helps you avoid sending an unsubmitted document to the vendor.

To send forms to your vendor, you must set up the consent and the email on the **Vendor Card** page. These settings include enabling the **Receiving 1099 E-Form Consent** field to acknowledge that your vendor provided signed consent to receive their 1099 form electronically using email.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your vendor gives consent for delivering 1099 forms via email, you can use the **E-Mail For IRS** field, but you can also keep this field blank and fill-in the standard **E-Mail** field. It will be used for sending instead.  

When the form document is created for a certain vendor, the values are inherited from the vendor card. You can see the
values on the **Email** FastTab of the document if you select **Show more**. After you create the document, you can't change the consent value in the document, but you can change the e-mail if needed. You can also change default values on the **Vendor Card** page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will apply these changes to all open (where the **Status** is **Open**) 1099 form documents if you confirm with **Yes**.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you send emails, you must configure the accounts, you use for email on the **Email Accounts** page.  

### Send emails

To send 1099 form to one specific vendor, you can do so from the chosen **1099 Form Document** by choosing the **Send Email** action. It's also possible to automate this process, and to send emails for multiple 1099 documents. To do that, open the **IRS 1099 Form Documents** list page, select one or more documents, and choose the **Send Email** action.  

After you run the **Send Email** action, select the report type you want to send. You can choose **Copy B** or **Copy 2** (required in some situations). By default, emails are sent only to vendors you haven't already sent them to. If you want to send emails for all selected documents (and resending for some of them), enable the **Resend Email** option on the request page.

After you select **OK**, an email is sent immediately for one document or, if you're sending multiple emails, it will be scheduled through the **Job Queue Entry**. If the email is sent successfully for a certain document, the **Copy B Sent** or **Copy 2 Sent** flag is set on the **IRS 1099 Form Document** page.

If you try to send email for only one document and sending failed, an error dialog displays. If you try to send email for multiple documents and sending fails, the error is logged to the **Email Error Log** field on the **IRS 1099 Form Document** page. When the job for sending multiple documents is finished, the results are recorded in the activity log. To open the **Activity Log** page, choose the **Activity Log** action on the **IRS 1099 Form Documents** page.

# Regulatory 1099 format changes and details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From version 24.0, you can start using the 1099 functionality for better transparency, integration, and automation. To do this, you must enable this feature using the **Feature Management** page. You can find more details [here](introduction-to-the-irs-forms.md). If you don't enable it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically enables it with version 27.0. Therefore, we recommend you use this version.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) periodically issues updates to the format used in the 1099 Form Box. This article lists changes to the codes and requirements in the IRS 1099 forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running the [**Update Form Boxes**](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md#setup) action prevents you from reporting for previous years because some boxes change their meaning. Make sure you've done all your reporting for the previous year before you update the form boxes to prepare for reporting for the new year.

## Regulatory 1099 format changes November 2023

There are no changes associated with the 1099 report layouts for the year 2023. To continue printing the text of the new year on reports, such as 2024, you should upgrade your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. To get this update, you must [run the **Update Form Boxes** action on the **1099 Form Boxes** page](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md#setup).   

## Regulatory 1099 format changes November 2022

1099 changes for 2022 provide an upgrade for the MISC and DIV boxes.

* Some of the boxes will be shifted in all 1099 reports.
* A calendar year is added in the top right corner in printouts.
* For the MISC report, the position of the FATCA mark is different. There are no changes in the sequence of text elements for the Magnetic Media.

The additions are relevant for the reporting year 2022. Before you prepare your reporting for 2021, you must first upgrade your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to handle the new requirements.

## Regulatory 1099 format changes December 2021

The following table lists the 1099 Form Box codes that are added to 1099 forms.

|Form  |Amount Type  | Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Form 1099-DIV     |Section 897 Ordinary Dividends         |     DIV-02-E     |
|Form 1099-DIV     |Section 897 Capital Gains         |    DIV-02-F     |
|Form 1099-MISC     |Fish Purchased for resale         |    MISC-11     |
|Form 1099-NEC     |Payer made direct sales totaling $5,000 or more of consumer products to recipient for resale         |    NEC-02     |

The additions are relevant for the reporting year 2021. Before you prepare your reporting for 2021, you must first upgrade your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to handle the new requirements. To get this update, you must [run the **Update Form Boxes** action on the **1099 Form Boxes** page](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md#setup). Alternatively, you can open the **1099 Form Boxes** page, and use the **Schedule an update of the form boxes** link in the notification to specify when you want the update to run.

## Regulatory 1099 format changes December 2020

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the new 1099 Form Box codes *NEC-01* and *MISC-14*, and a new form, *Vendor 1099 Nec*, have been added. The additions are relevant for the reporting year 2020. Before you submit your reporting for 2020, you must first upgrade your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to handle the new requirements. To get this update, you must [run the action **Update Form Boxes** on the **1099 Form-Boxes** page](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md#setup).  

## Regulatory 1099 format changes December 2018

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], a new 1099 Form Box code *DIV-05* has been added, and all the 1099 codes from DIV-05 to DIV-11 were upgraded to codes from DIV-06 to DIV-12. When you open the **IRS 1099 Form Box** page, a notification pops up to upgrade the form boxes. If you change the 1099 code on the **Vendor Card** page, a notification displays asking if you want to update the 1099 codes for all the associated entries (like purchase documents, journal lines, posted invoices, credit memos, and vendor ledger entries).

# Reconciling bank accounts in the US version

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bank reconciliation and deposits features are no longer available for the North American versions (US, CA, and MX) in 2023 release wave 2. The features are now part of the standard version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], so that more countries can benefit from them. To learn more about the standard features, go to [Manage and Reconcile Your Bank Accounts](../../bank-manage-bank-accounts.md).
>
> For details about what changed, go to [Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions).

> If you're still using the deprecated **Bank Reconciliation Worksheet** or **Deposits** pages, there are a few things you should do after you upgrade to 2023 release wave 2. For example, if you have open entries, you'll probably want to complete them. To learn more, go to [NA bank reconciliation and deposits are deprecated in the North American version](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-na-bank-rec).

# Introduction to the IRS 1099 tax forms

In this article, you learn how to set up 1099 reporting, generate 1099 Tax Forms, submit them to the IRS, and send copies to vendors using Business Central.

## IRS 1099 tax form introduction

The IRS 1099 form is used in the United States to report various types of income other than salaries, wages, or tips.

## Who needs to file an IRS 1099 tax form

IRS 1099 Tax Forms are used by businesses and individuals to report income such as payments made to nonemployees or independent contractors, miscellaneous income, dividends, interest, and similar.

## Types of IRS forms

There are several types of 1099 Tax Forms, each corresponding to a specific type of income. You can find a complete list of 1099 Tax Forms and instructions on the IRS website. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following 1099 Tax Form types:

- **1099-MISC**: This form reports miscellaneous income, such as payments made to nonemployees or independent contractors, royalties, rents, prizes, awards, and other income not reported on other forms.  
- **1099-NEC**: This form reports payment made to nonemployees or independent contractors. These payments are typically for services performed for a trade or business. Common uses of form type include reporting payments to freelancers, consultants, vendors, subcontractors, and other self-employed individuals who provide services to a business but aren't considered employees.
- **1099-INT**: This form reports interest income, such as interest paid by banks, savings accounts, bonds, notes, and other sources.  
- **1099-DIV**: This form reports dividend income, such as dividends paid by corporations, mutual funds, and other entities.

> [!NOTE]
> This guidance isn't intended as comprehensive instruction for tax reporting. Before making your final calculations, it's advisable to seek advice from your tax consultant, accountant, and representatives from the IRS.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The functionality described here is active from Business Central version 24.0 and it requires manual activation on the **Feature Management** page. After the user activates it, the old [1099 functionality](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md) is deactivated.

This feature integrates with the IRS and doesn't print 1099 Tax Forms on preprinted original IRS 1099 Tax Forms. Instead, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] submits 1099 Tax Forms through integration with IRS and sends Copy B to vendors as *Copy Substitutions* printed on plain paper.  

## Features overview

To get started managing IRS 1099 functionality, see the following articles.

# Set up and use the IRS 1096 form in the US version

Form 1096 is used to transmit paper tax forms to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. This feature lets you run the Form 1096 report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and send it to the IRS, if necessary. The feature is only related to already transmitted paper 1099 forms.

> [!NOTE]
> Form 1096 reporting supports only the IRS codes that are supported for Form 1099 reporting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. If you add other IRS codes to lines on the Form 1096, the report doesn't include them.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The IRS 1096 feature is compatible only with the [legacy 1099 functionality](set-up-use-irs1099-form.md), which lets you submit printed 1099 forms. The [new IRS 1099 feature](set-up-use-irs1099-form-v24.md) supports only electronic submissions, and not printed forms, so the 1096 form isn't required and this feature isn't compatible with the IRS 1099 feature.

## Enable the extension

Form 1096 is an extension. After you install the extension in your environment you must enable it, as described in the following steps.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Feature management**, and then choose the related link.
1. Find **Feature: Enable using Form 1096 to transmit paper Tax Forms to the IRS in the United States** and in the **Enabled for** field, choose **All Users**.
1. When you enable the feature, use the setup guide to set it up. The only information required is to specify the **IRS 1096 Form No. Series** to use. This number series is used to assign numbers for 1096 forms per certain period.

If you didn't use the setup guide to configure **IRS 1096 Form No. Series**, you can do so on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. Fill in the **IRS 1096 Form No. Series** field on the **Number Series** FastTab.

Complete the following steps to set up more required fields for reporting.

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
1. To specify the EIN number to show on the report, on the **Communication** FastTab in the **EIN Number** field, enter the number you registered with IRS.  
1. To specify who communicates with the IRS, in the **IRS Contact No.** field, select the employee responsible for this communication.  

## Create a new 1096 form

> [!NOTE]
> The IRS 1096 report layout currently supports reporting for the year 2023.  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1096 Forms**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Create forms…** action to create a new entry.
1. In the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, specify a date range for the calculations. Vendor ledger entries with posting dates in this period are considered.
1. If you want to replace existing forms with new forms, for example, if you made corrections, choose the **Replace** option. If you don't select this option, new forms are created and existing forms remain the same.
1. After you create the new forms, choose **OK**. A confirmation displays the message, **IRS 1096 forms have been created**.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a 1096 form for each of the IRS codes posted in vendor ledger entries during the period you defined.

You can open the forms to review and correct them if necessary.

The **General** FastTab contains the following information.

- **Starting Date** - Specifies the starting date of the period specified for the form.
- **Ending Date** - Specifies the ending date of the period specified for the form.
- **Status** - Specifies the status of the form. Only released forms can be printed. Only opened forms can be changed.
- **IRS Code** - Specifies the IRS code of the form.
- **Calculated Total Number of Forms** - Specifies the total number of forms per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action. You can't change this value.
- **Total Number of Forms** - Specifies the number of forms used for printing the form. This value matches the calculated number of forms after you choose the **Create Forms** action. You can change this value.
- **Calculated Amount** - Specifies the amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action. You can't change this value.
- **Calculated Adjustment Amount** - Specifies the adjustment amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action.
- **Total Amount to Report** - Specifies the adjustment amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action.

The lines contain the following information. Amounts are summarized per **Vendors** and **IRS Codes**.

- **IRS Code** - Specifies the IRS code.
- **Vendor no.** - Specifies the vendor number.
- **Calculated Amount** - Specifies the amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action. You can't change this value. You can check amounts in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** field for each record.
- **Calculated Adjustment Amount** - Specifies the adjustment amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action. You can check amounts in the **IRS 1099 Adjustments** field for each record.
- **Manually changed** - Specifies that the line was changed manually. This field is marked automatically if a record is changed manually.
- **Amount** - Specifies the amount used for printing the form. This value matches the calculated amount minus the calculated adjustment amount after choosing the **Create Forms** action. You can change this value. If you change this amount manually, the **Manually changed** field is marked.

## Make corrections in a 1096 form

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1096 Forms**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the form you want to edit.
1. If you want to update an amount:

   - Locate the line you want to update and mark the **Amount** field.
   - Enter the value you want to report. The **Manually changed** field is marked and the **Total Amount to Report** field on the header is updated.

1. If you want to add a new record, enter a new line, and fill in values you need for reporting in the **IRS Code**, **Vendor no.**, and **Amount** fields. The **Total Amount to Report** field on the header are updated.
1. In both of situations, when you make a change in the **1096 Form**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the following fields on the **History** FastTab:

   - **Changed By** - Specifies the ID of the last user who changed the form.
   - **Changed Date-Time** - Specifies the date and time when the last change was made in the form.

## Print the 1096 form

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1096 Forms**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the form you want to print.
1. If the status is **Open**, choose **Release** action to release the form and make it ready for printing.
1. Choose **Print** actions to print the single form.
1. If you didn't add the **IRS Contact No.** in the **Company Information**, enter details about the **Person to contact** on the request page, and then select **Print**.
1. After you print, the following fields at the **History** FastTab are updated:

    - **Printed by** - Specifies the ID of the last user who printed the form.
    - **Printed Date-Time** - Specifies the date and time of the last time that the form was printed.
    - **Printed** - Specifies that the form was printed.

# Sales tax in the US version

[!INCLUDE [sales-tax](../includes/CAMXUS/sales-tax-setup.md)]

If you set up new tax areas and tax jurisdictions, you must make sure that you fill in the fields correctly. In the United States, states, counties, cities, and localities can charge sales tax. Companies collect and remit sales tax to these government authorities for products sold to end users. Sales tax can also be charged to existing sales tax. For example, tax can be calculated on a sales invoice amount that already includes the tax from other jurisdictions.  

## Tax details

The **Tax Details** page shows different combinations of sales tax jurisdictions and sales tax groups to establish sales tax rates. For each tax jurisdiction, we recommend that you set up one tax group for normal sales tax. Also, set up another tax group for items or services that aren't taxed. Additionally, create a tax group for every type of item or service that is handled with a different sales tax rate in that jurisdiction. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

In the United States, when you sell to a customer at a location where you don't have a *situs*—or a legal location in that state—you don't collect sales tax. For locations in which you don't have a situs, ensure that both the **Tax Below Minimum** and **Tax Above Maximum** fields are 0.00.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have more than one company in the same database, you can use the **Copy Tax Setup** task to copy tax settings between them. The feature ensures that the tax information is identical throughout the companies.
>
> 1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Copy Tax Setup**, then choose the related link.
> 1. Select the company from which you want to copy the tax data, which setup information to copy, and choose **OK**.

# Set up the IRS 1099 forms

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires one or more versions of the 1099 tax form for payments to vendors. Copies of these forms must be sent to vendors annually on or before the last day of January. On your purchase documents, you can specify that the document is 1099 liable, and you can specify the 1099 code for the vendor.

## Enable the feature to send tax data using the 1099 form

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Feature Management**, and then choose the related link.
1. Find the following feature: **Feature Update: Enable using 1099 forms to transmit the tax data to the IRS in the United States** that you want to enable.
1. In the **Feature** column, choose the three vertical dots, and then choose the **Select More** action.
1. Select the checkbox for all the features that you want to edit, and then choose **Edit List**.
1. In the **Enabled for** column, change the status to **All Users**.
1. Choose the **Yes** button.
1. Become familiar with the feature, and then choose the **Next** button.
1. Specify the relevant **Reporting Year**.
1. Define the setup data you use for IRS forms.
1. By selecting the **Create new setup** field, you can choose to create a new default setup data in an app.
1. To transfer the existing data from the 1099 base application, select the **Transfer Existing Data** field.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you’re setting up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, choose **Create New Setup** to create the forms and associated setups. Afterward, you can fill in the appropriate fields in the forms and print them. If you’re upgrading and already have data for your 1099 form, you can choose **Transfer Existing Data** from the previous solution.

1. Specify how the IRS forms work with documents, because you can decide to choose the **Collect Details For Line** field. If you select this field, details are collected from the **IRS 1099 Form Doc Line Details** page for each of **Calculated Amounts** in the **IRS 1099 Form Document**. This option requires extra space in the database.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't select this field, the total amount is calculated without the details.

1. You can choose one or more options during setup.

   * **Protect TIN** (Taxpayer Identification Number) to mask or protect TIN for vendors or for both vendors and your company. You can also choose not to protect TIN numbers.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This protection option lets you print only the last four digits on your printing forms. The first five digits of the nine-digit number are truncated and replaced with Xs, following IRS regulations (example: XXXXX1234). This provides more security when sending documents via email, protecting the recipient from identity theft.  

 1. Finish the setup.

## Manual setup  

If you couldn't finish the setup when you enabled this feature, or you want to modify or add configurations, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS Forms Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **General** FastTab, you can change the setup for the **Collect Details For Line** and **Protect TIN** fields.  
1. You can also set up details for the email you want to send to your recipients:

   * Change the subject you in the **Email Subject** FastTab.  
   * Change the email body in the **Email Body** FastTab. To edit your email body, use the rich text editor.  

1. Close the page.

## Reporting periods and forms set up  

To configure reporting periods and forms, follow the steps:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS Reporting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **IRS Reporting Periods** page, specify the time period that the report applies to in the **Starting** and **Ending Date** fields.
1. To set up specific 1099 forms for this period, use the **Forms** action to open the **IRS Reporting Periods** page.  
1. On the **IRS 1099 Forms** page, specify 1099 form types, such as MISC, NEC, and so on. Because these form types have more than one source with different rules, you must set them up. To do so, run the **Form Boxes** action to open the **IRS 1099 Form Boxes** page.
1. On the **IRS 1099 Form Boxes** page, set up sources for your form type using the **No.** and **Description** fields. You must fill in the **Minimum Reportable Amount** field based on the IRS instruction for this reporting year. The minimum reportable amounts can be populated whether or not you need to report a certain form box.
1. Close the **IRS 1099 Form Boxes** page.
1. Close the **IRS 1099 Forms** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Every year, you must create a new reporting period. We recommend that you use the **Copy Setup From** action on the **IRS Reporting Periods** page, and choose the reporting period you want to copy from. With this process, all forms, form boxes, vendor setup, adjustment and form statement, except the form documents are copied to the selected period.  

## Vendors setup  

On the **IRS Reporting Periods** page, you can run the **Vendor Setup** action to open the **IRS 1099 Vendor Form Box Setup** page. Use the page to map the form boxes to each vendor in the period. When you create a document for a vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this setup to fill in the form boxes. To do so, follow the steps:

1. In the **Vendor No.** field, specify the vendor number.  
1. In the **Form No.** field, specify the vendor number.
1. In the **Form Box No.** field, specify the number of the 1099 form box.

You don't need to set up vendors manually, and you can use the **Suggest** action to run **IRS 1099 Suggest Vendors** automation. This action lets you choose different types of filters to apply to the vendors in the list. Afterward, you just need to add the default **Form No.** and **Form Box No.** for the list of vendors.  

By choosing the **IRS Setup** action in the **Related** menu, you can do the same setup on the **Vendor list** page.

> [!NOTE]
> This vendor setup is related to the specific period you configured on the **IRS Reporting Periods** page.  

You might need to do some more setup on the **Vendor card** page. To do so, follow the steps:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Details related to 1099 reporting are on the **Payments** FastTab. You can find default values for the following fields, based on the **IRS 1099 Vendor Form Box Setup** configuration:

   * **IRS Reporting Period**
   * **IRS 1099 Form No.**
   * **IRS 1099 Form Box No.**

1. To configure more required information, you can:  

   * Mark the **Receiving 1099 E-Form Consent** field to confirm that your vendor provided signed consent to receive their 1099 form electronically using email. You can't mark this field if a minimum email address isn't added for this vendor.
   * To use different emails for delivering IRS related emails, you can enter this information in the **E-Mail For IRS** field. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **Email** field.  
   * Mark the **FATCA Requirement** field to specify if the vendor is set up to require FATCA filing.

## Print report configuration

To print the form substitute documents, you must use a few setups. For every single printing form, there's a **Form Statement**. These statements are already configured, but you can change or update them. To do so, follow the steps:  

1. To configure or customize the printed form, choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the **IRS Reporting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
1. Use the **Forms** action to open the **IRS 1099 Forms** page.
1. When you open the **IRS 1099 Forms** page for a specific form **No.**, choose the **Edit Statement** action.  
1. On the **IRS 1099 Form Statement** page, you can set up filters and rules that apply to the form document lines when you print. You can use the following fields to set up the 1099 form statement:  

   * **Row No.** – Specifies a number that identifies the line. The number is used as a form box number on the printed report.  
   * **Description** – Specifies a description of the 1099 form box on the printed report.  
   * **Print Value Type** – Specifies the print value type of the statement. If **Amount** is selected, then the amount calculated by the filter expression is printed. If the **Yes/No** option is selected, then either **Yes** or **No** is printed based on the **Yes/No** condition.
   * **Filter Expressions** - Specifies the filter expression of the statement.
   * **Row Totaling** – Specifies a row-number interval or a series of row numbers.  
   * **Print with** – Specifies whether amounts on the 1099 form box are printed with their original sign using the option **Sign** or with the sign reversed using the option **Opposite Sign**.

1. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]  
> Also, for every form you can set up the recipient instructions. These instructions are printed on the second page of the report layout. This is required for printing the form by the IRS because the instructions explain the meaning of each form box.
> To do so, on the **IRS 1099 Forms** page, for the specific form **No.**, choose the **Edit Instructions** action to open the **IRS 1099 Form Instructions** page. On the **IRS 1099 Form Instructions** page, fill in the **Header** (it prints as a bold text) and **Description** fields (it prints as regular text).

# Set up and use the IRS 1099 form

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From version 24.0, you can start using the 1099 functionality for better transparency, integration, and automation. To do this, you must enable this feature using the **Feature Management** page. You can find more details [here](introduction-to-the-irs-forms.md). If you don't enable it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically enables it with the version 27.0. Therefore, we recommend you use this version.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires one or more versions of the 1099 tax form for payments to vendors. Copies of these forms must be sent to vendors annually on or before the last day of January. On your purchase documents, you can specify that the document is 1099 liable, and you can specify the 1099 code for the vendor.

## Setup

Before you start using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up **1099 Form Boxes** and **Vendors** as 1099 liable. The most common 1099 codes are already set up for you, and they're defined on the **1099 Form Box** page, where you can also add new 1099 codes. Before you prepare your reporting for the new year, you must first update your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to handle the new requirements.

### Update the 1099 form boxes

In order to support the form changes by the IRS, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] offers the **Update Form Boxes** action to include new codes and other requirements in the 1099 form. Learn about Regulatory 1099 Format Changes and Details, [here](tax-1099-changes.md).

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1099 Form Boxes**, and then choose the related link.

# Use the IRS 1099 forms

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] calculates 1099 forms only for vendors whose Purchase Invoice includes information about **IRS 1099 Form No.** and **IRS 1099 Form Box No.** on the document header and if the payment is posted and applied to this invoice.  

## Work with purchase documents  

To ensure all IRS-related fields are applied to the purchase document, the document must fall within the specified date range, and both IRS reporting periods and vendors must be configured. You need to [create the purchase document](../../purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and check if the **IRS Reporting Period**, **IRS 1099 Form No.** , and **IRS 1099 Form Box No.** fields are populated in the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab. These fields are prepopulated with default values from the **Vendor Card** page. You can change these values if this specific document needs to comply with a different 1099 form.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the **Posting Date** of the document isn't within the reporting period date, the IRS fields are disabled.
> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see populated IRS fields and you expect values there, verify that the document is within the date range that you configured for IRS reporting. Also, check if you created an IRS reporting period for this year and added this vendor to be 1099 eligible for this reporting year.  

When you [post this purchase document](../../purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), you can see the following fields populated in relation to this [posted document](../../purchasing-how-record-purchases.md):

- **IRS 1099 Reporting Period**
- **IRS 1099 Form No.**
- **IRS 1099 Form Box No.**
- **IRS 1099 Reporting Amount**

If you made a mistake and didn’t use **IRS 1099 Form No.** and **IRS 1099 Form Box No.** on the document, or you used the wrong one, you can make corrections. To make corrections, on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, select the line you want to correct, and then choose the **Edit List** action. Change the **IRS 1099 Form Box No.** and **IRS 1099 Reporting Amount** fields.

All 1099 forms are calculated based on the information provided on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page. But, make sure that the payment is posted and applied to the invoice during the same reporting period.  

## Precalculation  

### Amount adjustments

If you have some inaccurate information in the system or missed some document, you can manually adjust values before calculation. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS Reporting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **IRS Reporting Periods** page, choose the **Adjustments** action to open the **IRS 1099 Vendor Form Box Adjustments** page.  
1. Add the amount of adjustment to the IRS reporting amount, using **Vendor No.**, **Form No.**, **Form Box No.**, and the **Adjustment Amount**.
1. Close the page.

### Vendor corrections

If you didn’t configure the vendor properly, and forgot to add specific **Form No.** or **Form Box No.** but posted the documents or payments already, you can still make corrections. To make corrections, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS 1099 Vendor Form Box Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **IRS 1099 Vendor Form Box Setup** page, configure all necessary information and then choose the **Propagate** action for this vendor.
1. Choose how the new form box setup makes updates. You need to decide for which period you want to propagate this change and if you want to update existing opened purchase documents or vendor ledger entries, or both.
1. Close the page. Now you can continue with 1099 forms calculations.

## Create 1099 form documents

To create new 1099 form documents for the reporting years, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS Reporting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **IRS Reporting Periods** page, open the documents list, and then choose the **Documents** action.

   or

   Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IRS 1099 Form Documents**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **IRS 1099 Form Documents** page, choose the **Create Forms** action to create IRS 1099 forms based on the filters you want to use:

   - Selecting the period is required. The other choices are optional.  
   - If you don't select a vendor, then form documents are created for all vendors.
   - If you don't select a certain form, then form documents are created for all forms.
   - If you don't select the option **Replace**, then only new form documents are created. If you select the option **Replace**, then the existing form documents are replaced.

1. In the created 1099 form’s documents list you can see the list of all created documents based on the combination of vendors and form numbers. From this list, you can open any of the created documents.  
1. Once you open the document, you can find the following information on the document header:  

   |  Field Name  |  Description  |  
   |--------|-----------------|  
   | **Vendor No.** | Specifies the vendor number.  |
   | **Form No.** | Specifies the form number used for calculation of this document. |
   | **ID** | Specifies the noneditable ID of the document.  |
   | **Status** | Specifies the status of the document. Created document has **Open** status, but status can also be **Released** (when user releases it) and **Submitted** (after submitting to the IRS). |
   | **Receiving 1099 E-Form Consent** | By selecting this field, you acknowledge that your vendor has provided signed consent to receive their 1099 form electronically. This field can't be changed on the form as this can be done only on the **Vendor Card** page. Only a 1099 form with this consent can be sent to a vendor via email. |
   | **Email** | Specifies the email where the form is sent if the vendor consented to electronically receive 1099 forms. If this vendor configured the **E-Mail For IRS** field, this value appears; if not, the standard **E-Mail** field from the **Vendor Card** page is used.  |
   | **Copy B Sent** | Specifies whether this form copy is sent. This field is marked automatically and can't be edited.  |
   | **Copy C Sent** | Specifies whether this form copy is sent. This field is marked automatically and can't be edited.  |

1. The lines in documents have the following information:  

   |  Field Name  |  Description  |  
   |--------|---------------------|
   | **Form Box No.** | Specifies the number of the 1099 form box used in this line.   |
   | **Calculated Amount** | Specifies the amount per period and IRS code calculated by the **Create Forms** action on the list page. This amount is taken from the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page. If you enable the **Collect Details For Line** option, then you can see the connected entries. This value can't be changed. |
   | **Adjustment Amount** | Specifies the calculated adjustment amount of the document line, the amount you specified for the **Period**, **Vendor**, and **Form Box** during your setup. This amount can't be changed manually. |
   | **Amount** | Specifies the amount of the document line. The sum of calculated amount and adjustment amount. This value is used for reporting and the amount can be changed manually.  |
   | **Minimum Reportable Amount** | The threshold to decide whether the certain form box with the reporting amount must be reported.   |
   | **Include in 1099** | Specifies whether the document line should be included in the 1099. The line is included if the amount is more than or equal to the minimum reportable amount. |

1. Close the page.

# Keep transactional data for five years in Denmark

Based on the Danish bookkeeping act, Dynamics 365 Business Central, as a digital standard bookkeeping system, must support storage of the company's recorded transactions and receipts that are covered by §3 for five years from the end of the financial year. Together with digital vouchers, those posted transactions must be preserved so that they can't be changed, backdated, or deleted by the company or a user. A software provider must keep them stored in a structured and machine-readable format during that period, regardless of any termination of customer relations with the company, or the company's bankruptcy or forced dissolution.

To meet these requirements, Microsoft exports all required transactional data and the related digital vouchers on a daily basis in the account-protected Azure Blob Storage. After the data and vouchers are posted, they can't be changed, backdated, or deleted by the company. This data can be made available only to Danish authorities in response to an official request based on the law. Even then, access to this data is read-only.

Because the system saves data daily, data that isn't required by the law (that is, data that's older than five years from the end of the financial year that the material concerns) can be automatically located and removed, based on the requirement for not keeping data longer than is required by the law. Microsoft doesn't keep data in this storage before the law requires (that is, from the year 2024).

## Mandatory use of the CVR number

The Central Business Register (CVR) number must be filled in before users post to the general ledger. To fill it in, follow these steps:

1. Select the search button ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
1. In the **Registration No.** field, enter the CVR number for your company.
1. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you enter the CVR number in the **Registration No.** field on the **Company Information** page and Nemhandel APIs validates the number, you can't modify or delete it.

# Set up OIOUBL

You must define a location for storing Offentlig Information Online UBL (OIOUBL) files when you create electronic documents such as invoices or credit memos. You must also define payment methods, payment terms, and item charges, and you must set up relevant customers for OIOUBL.  

* Set up payment terms and item charges.  
* Set up customers for OIOUBL.  

### About OIOUBL profiles

OIOUBL profiles are adaptations of business processes for various types of transactions, and differ depending on the types and contents of the documents that are exchanged. In Denmark, the two profiles that are required are the **Simpel fakturaproces** (Procurement-OrdSim-BilSim-1.0) and **Billing Basic** (urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0) profiles. The Billing Basic profile is based on the Northern European Subset (NES). Your customer must be able to receive documents in one of these profiles. If you aren't sure, ask your customer about the profile they require. Refer to the entry on OIOUBL profiles in the frequently asked questions section at [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://aka.ms/Digitaliseringsstyrelsen).  

The default profile for all customers is the Simpel fakturaproces profile, which is chosen on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. You specify the profile for a specific customer on the **Customer** card. If you want to use the Billing Basic profile you need to add it. To do so, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the button in the **Default Profile Code** field, and then choose **New**. Enter a name for the code, and then in the **Profile** field, enter **urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0**. You can then choose the profile either as the default profile, or for one or more customers.

# Standard chart of accounts in Denmark

The new Danish bookkeeping act requires the use of a standard chart of accounts. Because of this requirement, the Danish tax authority is providing a standard chart of accounts that can be used. Use the chart of accounts when you prepare annual accounts, and when you calculate regular tax and value-added tax (VAT) payments. You can use any chart of accounts that's included on the **Chart of Accounts** page. However, for required reporting, you must use the **G/L Mapping** page to map all general ledger (GL) accounts with the standard chart of accounts that's required by the law.

## Set up a standard chart of accounts

GL accounts require a specific standard chart of accounts for use in Denmark. Before you start, make sure that you install the **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. After you configure your GL accounts, your exported files (Standard Audit File for Tax \[SAF-T\] and Regnskab Basis) are based on the configured mappings. To configure a standard chart of accounts, provide the GL account as explained in [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).

# Create electronic documents by using OIOUBL

> [!NOTE]
> This feature isn't related to the new E-documents framework and requirements related to the new Danish bookkeeping act. For new functionality and updated OIOUBL 3.0, you can find updated content in **Electronic invoicing with NemHandel**.

When you sell goods or services to a customer in the public sector, you must submit documents electronically. You can create the following electronic documents:

* Invoices
* Credit memos
* Reminders
* Finance charge memos

Before you can create the electronic documents though, you must set up your customers for OIOUBL. Learn more in [Set Up Customers for OIOUBL](how-to-set-up-customers-for-oioubl.md).  

You can create an electronic document after you post the sales or service document. The following sections describe how to post a sales invoice with the required information and then create an electronic sales invoice, but the same procedure applies to sales and service credit memos and reminders.  

## Post a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Open the sales invoice that you want to post.  
1. Make sure that the **External Document No.** field contains the document number that the customer supplied. OIOUBL electronic documents require this number.

    > [!Note]  
    > For service documents, you must fill in the **Your Reference** field.  

1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **GLN** and **OIOUBL Account Code** fields.  

   For reminders and finance charge memos, the fields are on the **Posting** FastTab.  

1. Post the invoice.  

## Create an electronic sales invoice

After you post a document, you can create an electronic invoice in an OIOUBL format. The following steps describe the process for posted sales invoices, but the process is the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Open the relevant posted sales invoice.  
1. Choose the **Create Electronic <*document type*>** action.  
1. Optionally, in the **Create Electronic <*document type*>** page, set additional filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In the online version of Business Central and the web client for on-premises versions, the XML file is created in your Downloads folder.

# Export the SAF-T audit file format in Denmark

You can export all mandatory required data according to the Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) format in Denmark. SAF-T is an international standard for the electronic exchange of reliable accounting data from organizations to a national tax authority or external auditors. Danish tax authorities use Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard SAF-T as the standard file format for reporting. However, some Denmark-specific fields exist in this file export.  

## Exporting audit files

Export of the SAF-T audit file format in the Danish localization is based on the **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. Learn more in [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md)  

Learn more in [Danish Local Functionality](denmark-local-functionality.md), which provides a list of features that are specific to Denmark.

## Import audit files  

You can import SAF-T file in Danish localization. To do this, complete the following steps.

1. Select the search button ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter **Import SAF-T Files**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **Import SAF-T Files** page, select **Import SAF-T File**.
1. On the attachment page, upload the SAF-T file by using drag and drop or by browsing to the file you want to import.  

When you finish importing the external SAF-T files, the result appears in the **Import SAF-T Files** list page.

From the **Import SAF-T Files** page, you can find details about imported SAF-T files with the specific name and the date once the file is uploaded.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import the SAF-T file, keep in mind that there are no additional actions in the system based on this information. Dynamics 365 Business Central can only keep the list of uploaded files.

# Set up electronic invoicing with NemHandel

In Denmark, you can configure your e-invoicing system to work with NemHandel by using third-party certified access points. Before you begin, read the [Set the E-Documents connector with external endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md) article for information on using e-documents with external services, and establish a contract with one of the supported external certified access point providers.

Before you begin the setup, open the **Extension management** page, and verify that the following apps are installed:

- E-Document Core
- E-Documents Connector with External Endpoints
- OIOUBL
- E-Document format for OIOUBL

In Danish E-Documents functionality, you can select OIOUBL and PEPPOL BIS 3 as document formats in **E-Document Services**.

## E-Document services setup

> [!NOTE]
> To establish these connections, it's necessary to communicate with external service providers, who may require additional payment and contracts. To obtain all the necessary credentials, contact the service providers.

To set up services, complete the following steps:

### Use OIOUBL format  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **New** to create the OIOUBL service.
1. Fill in all the data as explained in [Set the E-Documents connector with external endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).
1. In the **Document Format** field, select **OIOUBL** as the export format of the electronic export setup.
1. In the **Service Integration** field, specify the service access point that you want to use.
1. Select **Setup Service Integration**, and follow the instructions for [using E-Documents Connector with External Endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md). Then close the page.

### Use Peppol format  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **New** to create the PEPPOL service.
1. Fill in all the data as explained in [Set the E-Documents connector with external endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).
1. In the **Document Format** field, select **PEPPOL BIS 3.0** as the export format of the electronic export setup.
1. In the **Service Integration** field, specify the service access point that you want to use.
1. Select **Setup Service Integration**, and follow the instructions for [using E-Documents Connector with External Endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md). Then close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> If a **GLN No.** isn't specified in the **Company Setup**, all electronic documents are exported using the company's **VAT Registration No.** as the identifier. In this case, the **VAT Scheme** using for electronic documents in Denmark is set to 0184. You can check the **VAT Scheme** value in the **Country/Region** page for each of countries. It means this value is used in all nodes when applicable. It's also added as a prefix DK to **VAT Registration No.** when applicable.  

Learn more in the [How to set up E-Documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) article, which provides information on configuring workflows, customers, and vendors. Refer to the [Set the E-Documents connector with external endpoints](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md) article for information on using e-documents with external services.

# Compliance with the bookkeeping act in Denmark

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] (cloud) is registered as a digital bookkeeping system in Denmark.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dynamics 365 Business Central is registered as a digital bookkeeping system only as a standard solution without customizations (as-is). If the system is customized, it is on partner or customer to prove that this system is still a standard solution, as Microsoft can't provide opinion if customizations break parts of a digital bookkeeping system DBA certified.  

Registration certificate is based on cf. §4 subsection 1 of the executive order no. 98 of January 26, 2023, regarding the notification and registration of digital standard bookkeeping systems according to which the digital standard bookkeeping system [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], has been registered by the Danish Business Authority on December 21, 2023, with the **registration number fob467715**.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following document doesn't provide official documentation in the process of certification with DBA. This is just an explanation that Dynamics 365 Business central complies all requirements and eventually instruction for partners or customers if they want to certify their solution outside of Microsoft.  

## How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] ensure compliance?

To achieve this registration certificate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] had to comply with different requirements by Danish Business Authorities based on the Executive order no. 97.  

## Main requirements - § 15, no. 1

Support a continuous registration of the company's transactions with the indication of appendices for each registration and safe storage of registrations and appendices for five years.  

### Annex 1, 1, a – e  

**Requirement**: The standard digital bookkeeping system must contain fields for the company to provide information on the following matters when recording each individual transaction:  

* Transaction date (for example, payment date, purchase date, etc.)  
* Amount
* Receipt number  
* Transaction text  
* Exchange rate on the day of the transaction or other conversion factor if registration is made in a currency other than DKK.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

All transactions entered within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] contain a transaction date, amount, receipt number/document number, and transaction text/description. All entries in general ledger transactions are stored exclusively in DKK. If the original document has currency other than DKK, this information exists in subledger connected with general ledger entry. All this information can be found on the **G/L Register** page. The **G/L Register** page provides details about each transaction, including the register number, the creation date and time, the user ID of who created the transaction, and its source code.  

### Annex 1, 2, a – e

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system must ensure:  

* That the system assigns a registration date for each recorded transaction.  
* That the system assigns a consecutive transaction number or ID for each recorded transaction.
* That the system assigns initials or similar to the person who has recorded a transaction.
* That the system saves changes to the recording, for example, in that incorrect entries must be corrected with new entries.
* That recorded transactions can't be changed, backdated or deleted.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

An audit trail record is created for every transaction (**G/L Register**) upon posting that registers the **Created Date** and even **Creation Time** together with **User ID** as a person who recorded a transaction. For each audit trail record - register, you can also view the No. column, which specifies the system-created number of the general ledger register.  

**G/L Register** and **General Ledger Entries** and all subledgers have unique system-based entry numbers, which allows each number sequence to be defined as consecutive.  

After a transaction is posted, the transaction can't be edited or deleted after posting. Corrections to the transaction must be made through a reversing entry and then a new entry to register the changes. Correction can be done manually or using **Reverse** action from the **G/L Register** for reversing completely transaction. But in any case, reversing transaction is created as a new transaction without changing original values. Learn more in the [Understand the general ledger and Chart of Accounts](../../finance-general-ledger.md) article, which provides information on the chart of accounts.

### Annex 1, 3, a – b

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system must support the storage of receipts covered by § 3 which document the company's recorded purchase and sale transactions:  

* Receipts relating to purchase transactions can be stored digitally in the system.
* Receipts relating to sales transactions are either automatically generated in the system and stored digitally or can be stored digitally in the system, for example, as an image or a scanned file.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the storage of files as attachments to purchase and sales invoices and any other record of a table that is accessible by users of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] via user interface. However, to support mandatory attachments for purchase and sales transactions, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] has a more default set up for digital vouchers, where it requires mandatory attachment for sales and purchase transactions and doesn't allow posting these documents without having attachments. For more automation, sales transactions automatically create sales documents and attach them to this transaction without user interaction. But the user can add more documents if they want. Learn more in the [Set up digital vouchers in Denmark](how-to-digital-vouchers-dk.md) article, which provides information on mandatory digital vouchers.

### Annex 1, 4 and 1, 4, a-d

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system must support the storage of the company´s recorded transactions and receipts covered by § 3 for 5 years from the end of the financial year the material concerns. The digital standard bookkeeping system must support:

* That recorded transactions are preserved so that they can't be changed, backdated or deleted by the company.
* That all recorded transactions are stored in a structured and machine-readable format for five years from the end of the financial year the recorded transaction relates to, regardless of any termination of customer relations with the company or the company's bankruptcy or forced dissolution.
* That all receipts covered by section 3 are kept for five years from the end of the financial year that the receipt concerns, regardless of any termination of customer relations with the company or the company's bankruptcy or forced dissolution.

That encrypted bookkeeping data can be decrypted into a structured and machine-readable format and that encrypted receipts covered by section 3 can be decrypted into a readable format.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the storage of the company’s recorded transactions and digital vouchers. Transactional records once created can't be deleted or modified via the user interface of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], and the **Company** also can't be deleted from the moment when the company is proclaimed as the production company and registered with Nemhandel. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] also prevents backdating of the recorded transaction, meaning that posted transaction date can't be edited and changed. Standard functionality of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] allows users to post transactions dated in the past period (date, week, month ago), but in this situation there's information about **Created Date** and **Created Time** of a record.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] also supports the storage of files as attachments (receipts or digital vouchers) to purchase and sales invoices and any other record of a table that is accessible by users of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] via user interface. All attached documents are stored in the database, so database backup keeps attachments as well. These kinds of attachments ([mandatory digital vouchers](how-to-digital-vouchers-dk.md)) can't be deleted once when the document is posted, and general ledger entries are created.  

During the time of usage of the system, authorities can get access to all transactions and digital vouchers directly through the user interface from users as the database is always active and available. Even if the user doesn’t want to provide access to the transactional records, or in the event of termination of customer relations with Microsoft, or the company's bankruptcy or forced dissolution, Microsoft can still provide transactional and digital voucher details.

All this transactional data and the original documents existing in the accounting system are used as a source of daily data export in the account-protected Azure storage environment where they can't be changed, backdated, or deleted by the company, as this process is on the platform level without any user access. Storage account credentials are kept in Azure Key Vault and the data in the storage is protected against potential tampering. Learn more in [Keep transactional data for five years in Denmark](how-to-keep-data-5years.md).

## Main requirements - § 15, no. 2

Meet recognized standards for IT security, including for user and access management, and ensure automatic backup of records and appendixes.  

### § 8, par. 4, no. 1 - 7

**Requirements**: Network security, Access management, Supplier management, Backup, Logging, Preparedness and re-establishment, and Data protection.  

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

Microsoft provided the following documents: _**Certificate of Registration for Information Security Management System - ISO/IEC 27001:2022**_ and _**Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum**_. These documents confirm that the system has a high IT-security level and that security level is based upon a risk assessment.

## Main requirements - § 15, no. 3  

Support the automatization of administrative processes, including the automatic sending and receiving of e-invoices and the possibility of entering in accordance with a public standard chart of accounts in registered accounting systems.

### Annex 2, 1, a – e and 2, 2, a – f

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system supports the automatic sending and receiving of e-invoices via Nemhandel in OIOUBL format in the following way:

* The customer can send electronic invoices in OIOUBL format.
* The customer can receive electronic invoices in OIOUBL format.
* The customer can send electronic credit notes in OIOUBL format.
* The customer can receive electronic credit notes in OIOUBL format.
* The customer can send an application response upon receipt of an electronic invoice.

The digital standard bookkeeping system supports the automatic sending and receiving of e-invoices in Peppol BIS format in the following way:

* The customer can send electronic invoices in Peppol BIS format.
* The customer can receive electronic invoices in Peppol BIS format.
* The customer can send electronic credit notes in Peppol BIS format.
* The customer can receive electronic credit notes in Peppol BIS format.
* The customer can send a message level response upon receipt of an electronic invoice.
* The customer can send an invoice response upon receipt of an electronic invoice.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

[Electronic invoicing functionality](../../finance-edocuments-overview.md) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides the possibility to generate electronic analogs of business documents (customer invoices or customer credit memo) in required formats (OUOUBL and Peppol BIS) and perform post-processing of generated electronic documents, for example, send it to various destinations, as well as, to import vendor electronic documents (vendor invoices or vendor credit memo) into the system from various external sources. As users need to send electronic documents directly, they can do it via Access Point service provider(s) where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] is acting as transportation layer for sending created PEPPOL and OIOUBL standard compliant XML e-invoices as well as receiving, parsing, and importing XML received in before-mentioned formats as required by the law. In this scenario [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] e-documents exchange functionality works by the 4-corner model.  

Messaging is based on combination of synchrony and asynchrony API communication with an Access Point Service Provider. All types of information regarding ability to process incoming invoices, and business users’ notifications of approval or rejections of documents, are working based on predefined proper message processing. Learn more in [Set up electronic invoicing with NemHandel](how-to-edocuments-nemhadel.md).  

### Annex 2, 3, a  

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system supports the possibility of reconciling the company's bookkeeping with the company's bank account by importing a CSV file with bank entries into the bookkeeping system.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides a comprehensive solution that meets the requirement of the digital standard bookkeeping system supporting the possibility of reconciling the company’s bookkeeping with the company’s bank account. It supports advanced bank reconciliation, allowing you to import electronic bank statements in various formats, including CSV, and automatically reconcile them with bank transactions in the system. Learn more in [Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension](../../ui-extensions-payments-reconciliation-formats-dk.md) and [FIK Details in the Payment Reconciliation Journal](fik-details-in-the-payment-reconciliation-journal.md) in Denmark.

### Annex 2, 3, 2. a– b  

**Requirement**: The bookkeeping system supports, in addition to previous requirement, the possibility of reconciling the company's bookkeeping with the company's bank account by:

* The bookkeeping system ensures that the bank account is represented in the chart of accounts and that it can be reconciled with the loaded bank entries.
* A clear difference is being shown in the bookkeeping system if items entered from the bank aren't reconciled.  

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

Users use bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of their banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in the local currency (DKK) or in the foreign currency. Each bank account is linked to an account in the chart of accounts through the assigned bank account posting group. Using a bank account in a payment transaction automatically creates an entry in both the bank account and the connected general ledger (G/L) account.  

Bank reconciliation is how users make sure that the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] matches the external account at the bank. Bank account reconciliation compares and matches entries in the bank accounts users set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with bank transactions at their bank. Reconciliation can then post the balances to their bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to make them available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

If users find a mistake in a posted bank reconciliation, they can use the **Undo** action on the **Bank Account Statement List** page to correct it. When they undo a posted bank reconciliation, the entries are moved to the **Bank Reconciliation** page and marked as **Open**, meaning they aren't reconciled. They can then correct the bank reconciliation and post it again.

A clear difference is being shown in the bookkeeping system if items entered from the bank aren't reconciled.

* [Reconcile Payments that Can't be Applied Automatically](../../receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)  
* [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](../../receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md)

### Annex 2, 4, a – c  

**Requirement**: The digital standard bookkeeping system supports the possibility of using a public standard chart of accounts:

* The company uses the public standard chart of accounts directly in the bookkeeping system.
* Mapping the bookkeeping system's standard chart of accounts to the public standard chart of accounts.
* The bookkeeping system provides a tool that enables the customer to map their own chart of accounts to the common public standard chart of accounts in a simple way.

**How does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] comply?**

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], one company can use only one **Chart of Accounts** for posting into **General Ledger Entries**. Users can set up **Chart of Accounts** to be the same as Danish public standard chart of accounts manually or during the initialization of the SAF-T app.  

But if users already created a main chart of accounts different from the public standard chart of accounts, or they want to use one different from other reasons, they can always have mapped chart of accounts with the public standard chart of accounts. Danish [public standard chart of accounts is initialized by default in the system in the **Standard Accounts** page](how-to-set-up-standard-coa.md).

### Annex 2, 4, 2. a

# Set up customers for OIOUBL

To create Offentlig Information Online UBL (OIOUBL) documents for customers in the public sector, you must add OIOUBL information for the relevant customers.  

This article only describes fields that apply to OIOUBL. Learn more in [Register New Customers](../../sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

### Process to set up customers

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Open the customer that you want to enable for OIOUBL.  
1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**GLN**|Enter the customer's Global Location Number, which uniquely identifies the billing address. A GLN has a fixed length of 13 digits. It includes an assigned company prefix, a location reference, and a check digit.|  
    |**Account Code**|Enter the account code for the customer.<br><br/> Customers in the public sector provide an account code when they place an order or requisition. Based on the value of this field, the account code is included in the OIOUBL documents that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. In accordance with **Lov om Offentlige Betalinger** and related statutes, the customer is entitled to withhold payment until they receive an invoice with the relevant account code.|

# Submit VAT returns electronically

In the Danish localization, Microsoft Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports using the Danish Tax Agency's VAT API to report value-added tax (VAT) returns.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature allows you to report **_draft VAT Return version_** to skat.dk website from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. You'll still need to manually log in into your account on the tax authorities site, review the draft, and submit it finally. Reporting such draft needs to be set up first in the tax authorities account. Learn more in **Onboarding legal entities** on the skat.dk website.
> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin, make sure that the **Electronic VAT Declaration for Denmark** app is installed and enabled.

To generate a VAT return and send it directly to the Danish Tax Agency's VAT API, complete the following setup:

- On the **Company Information** page, configure the **Registration No.** and **VAT Registration No.** fields for the legal entity. In the **Registration No.** field, enter the legal entity's Central Business Register (CVR) number.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup SAF-T** page, associate a VAT posting group setup with **Sales VAT Reporting Code** and **Purchase VAT Reporting Code**.
- Obtain certificates to work with the Danish Tax Agency's VAT API, and store them in the Azure key vault.

## Set up VAT return submission

Complete the following procedures to set up VAT return submission.

### Set up certificates

> [!NOTE]
> If you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online, you don't need to configure your certificates, as you'll use preinstalled Microsoft security certificate for VAT submission.

If you use on-premises [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] version, before you begin the setup, an administrator must configure the certificates using the following procedure:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Certificates**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **New** to create a _client certificate_. This certificate is a company certificate (VOCES3) that's issued by MitID Erhverv (OCES3). It must include a private key for signing.
1. Select **New** to create a _server certificate_. This certificate is a certificate that NemVirksomhed provides to verify response XML.

> [!NOTE]
> If you opt for the online option, the Microsoft Denmark A/S *CVR number* must be used to authorize your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in your company's _skat.dk_ profile. This allows the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to submit VAT drafts, as Microsoft already provides a default certificate for connecting to the _skat.dk_.

### Set up electronic VAT declaration

Follow these steps to configure the electronic VAT declaration:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Declaration Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. On the **Electronic VAT Declaration Setup** page, enter your legal SE/CVR number in the **ERP SE Number** field as a number used to report the VAT return to Skat service. After you enter your CVR number, you'll have to give a consent that your data would be shared with the third-party system (skat.dk) in this process. If you agree, you need to select the **I accept** button.  

### Set up VAT report  

Follow these steps to configure a VAT reporting:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.  
1. Make sure that the setup for VAT Return with version **DK ELE.VAT** exists, and gets selected in the **VAT Report Version** field on the **VAT Reports Configuration** page. This setup activates the following fields: **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID**, **Content Codeunit ID**, **Submission Codeunit ID**, and **Validate Codeunit ID** and populate the values.
1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **VAT Report Setup** page, select the **Return Period** FastTab, and verify that the **Report Version** field contains the **DK ELE.VAT** setup report version that you previously configured.
1. The **Manual Receive Codeunit ID** field where you can specify the codeunit ID associated with a manual receipt of the VAT return periods. If codeunit `13610` is selected, the **Manual Receive Codeunit Caption** field is automatically populated with the
**Elec. VAT Decl. Get Periods** value.

### Set up VAT statements

Follow these steps to configure a VAT statement:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **VAT Statements** page, create a new VAT statement by using the **VAT Statement Name** page, or use a default statement.
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, use the **Box No.** field to set up VAT setup lines so that they point VAT setups to the correct export boxes. Each box number is linked to the `ModtagMomsangivelseForeloebig` XML field.
1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return E-Submission Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. Set up endpoints for the **VirksomhedKalenderHent**, **ModtagMomsangivelseForeloebig**, and **MomsangivelseKvitteringHent** services. You can select **Set Default Endpoints** to have the system run automatically. Alternatively, you can make updates if the default values are no longer usable.
1. Set **Client Certificate Code** and **Server Certificate Code** to the certificates that you previously created and uploaded on the **Certifications** page.

## Use and submit a VAT return

Follow these steps to submit a VAT return:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **Get VAT Return Periods**. Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] contacts the **VirksomhedKalenderHent** endpoint and gets VAT return periods for your company.  
1. Select an existing VAT return period, and then select **Create VAT Return**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new **VAT Return** record.  
1. Select **Suggest Lines** to get suggested and created lines/records for the VAT return.
1. When you check and confirm the validity of the suggested lines, select **Release** to protect any changes in the VAT return before you submit the return.
1. When you're ready to submit the VAT return, select **Submit** to generate the XML body for the request and submit the request to the **ModtagMomsangivelseForeloebig** service.

If the process is done correctly, you receive a "Request has been submitted" message, and the VAT return's status is changed to **Submitted**.

You can double-check the request message for the VAT return later by choosing the **Download** action.  

## After a VAT return is submitted

You won't always know the final status that's confirmed by the authorities. Therefore, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] regularly checks the **MomsangivelseKvitteringHent** service through the configured endpoint, to look for any response about submitted VAT returns. If a response is available, it's received, and the status of the company's VAT return is changed to **Accepted** or **Rejected**.

You can download a **Response** message by selecting **Download**. If the status is **Accepted**, you can save the receipt link for the VAT return.

# Notification and registration for the NemHandelsregisteret in Denmark

According to the Danish bookkeeping act, as of January 2024, all standard systems must notify users that they can register with the NemHandelsregisteret. They must also provide information about the registration functionality.

In addition, if the company isn't registered with the NemHandelsregisteret, a notification appears at the top of page and provides registration instructions.

## Notification about not being registered

If the company isn't registered with the NemHandelsregisteret, you receive the following notification: "Your accounting software isn't registered in Nemhandelsregisteret." You can complete the registration process directly from the notification, by selecting either the **Register in Nemhandelsregisteret** link or the **Open registration guide** link. Both links direct you to the external Nemhandel content.

If the company is already registered, and if a valid Central Business Register (CVR) number is entered in the **Registration No.** field on the **Company Information** page, the notification doesn't appear.

> [!NOTE]
> A notification appears on the **Company Information** page and on the following role centers: Accountant, Business Manager, Administration of users, security groups and permissions, Sales Order Processor, and Sales and Relationship Manager.

## Registration with the NemHandelsregisteret

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you begin registration, you must enter a valid CVR number in the **Registration No.** field on the **Company Information** page.

To start registration, select the **Register in Nemhandelsregisteret** link in the notification. Before the external system calls are made, or before you open the NemHandelsregisteret registration form, you must confirm your consent.

After you complete the registration with the NemHandelsregisteret, the existing notification disappears, because Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central confirms that the company's CVR number from the **Registration No.** field on the **Company Information** page is registered with the NemHandelsregisteret through the API call. In Business Central's internal records, the company has a status of **registered in NemHandelsregisteret**.

## Other important facts

If the company is registered with the NemHandelsregisteret, and if it has set the **VAT Registration No.** and **Registration No.** fields on the **Company Information** page, you can't delete the company from the **Companies** page. This limitation exists because the company is a production company in this case, and you can't delete production transactions.

Additionally, when you select **Copy** on the **Companies** page, the new company is created, and the **Registered with Nemhandel** and **Registration No.** fields are left blank.

> [!NOTE]
> These limitations work only if the environment is a production environment. In a sandbox environment, you can delete the company without limitations.
>
> If you don't enter a valid CVR number in the **Registration No.** field, you can't use E-documents in Denmark.

# VAT-VIES reporting in the Danish version

Danish companies must submit VAT declarations for trade of goods or services with other EU countries/regions. You can create the required file by using the **EC Sales List** report.  

## Set up VAT registration numbers

To report VAT-VIES correctly, you must enter a plain VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** on **Customer** and **Vendor** cards. That means you can't add country codes or other shortcuts as the VAT-VIES reporting requires plain VAT number for clients. It's different for Intrastat, so you can set up exactly how you want VAT registration numbers to be generated for Intrastat in the **Intrastat Setup** page. Learn more in [VAT Registration Number Setup for Intrastat](vat-registration-no-intrastat.md).  

## Reporting EU sales

In order to track VAT for the trade of goods or services between EU countries/regions, you must submit information about this trade to the Danish Listesystem. The **EC Sales List** report creates a file that you can then upload to the tax authorities on the [www.skat.dk](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=212340) site. Before you create the file, you can verify your customers’ VAT registration number online. The tax authorities also recommend that you don't submit large files to the online portal. If your declaration consists of more than 1,000 lines, it's recommended that you submit several smaller files instead. Learn more in the tax authorities’ [website](https://www.skat.dk).

# FIK details in the payment reconciliation journal

The **Transaction Text** field on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page shows information about the automatic application of payments using the Danish FIK standard. Learn more in [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](../../receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).  

The following table describes the six values that might be shown in the **Transaction Text** field.

|Transaction Text|Description|  
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Matching Amount**|The amount paid covers exactly the remaining amount on an unpaid sales invoice that is identified by the FIK number.|  
|**Partial Amount**|The amount paid is less than the remaining amount on an unpaid sales invoice that is identified by the FIK number.|  
|**Excess Amount**|The amount paid is more than the remaining amount on an unpaid sales invoice that is identified by the FIK number.|  
|**No Matching FIK Number**|The system has not found any unpaid or paid sales invoices with a FIK number that matches the FIK number on the payment.|  
|**Duplicate FIK Number**|The system has discovered that there are payments that have similar FIK numbers.|  
|**Invoice Already Paid**|The system has discovered that a FIK number on a payment matches a sales invoice that is fully applied and closed.|

# VAT registration number setup for Intrastat in the Danish version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In Denmark, the VAT-VIES requirements mean that you specify a unique VAT number in the **VAT Registration No** field on the customer or vendor cards. But reporting for Intrastat requires a VAT registration number in the submitted files that consists of the country code and the VAT registration number.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for Intrastat

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify how the VAT number for customers should be created in the Intrastat file, choose one of the available options in the **Customer VAT No. on File** field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
1. To specify how the VAT number for vendors should be created in the Intrastat File, choose one of the available options in the **Vendor VAT No. on File** field.  

You can choose between the following options:

* VAT registration number  
* Country code + VAT registration number  
* VAT registration number without the country code  

Depending on your choices, the relevant numbers are concatenated from the values of the **VAT Reg. No.** and **EU Country Code** fields.

# The OIOUBL Extension for Electronic Invoicing in Denmark

When you sell goods or services to customers in the Danish public sector, you must submit documents to the customer electronically in an XML file that is structured to meet the requirements of one or more Offentlig Information Online - Universal Business Language (OIOUBL) profiles.  

The OIOUBL extension in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to generate these XML documents for posted sales and service invoices, credit memos, and issued reminders (which include finance charge memos).  

The current requirements for sending electronic invoices are based on UBL version 2.0 standard. For more information, see the [https://aka.ms/OasisUblSite](https://aka.ms/OasisUblSite) web site.

For more information about OIOUBL in general, see the website for [Online OIOUBL Documentation](http://www.oioubl.info/classes/da/index.html), and the [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://digst.dk/) website.  

## Getting started with the OIOUBL extension

By default, the OIOUBL extension is installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. However, there are a few things to do before you can use the extension:

# OIOUBL Electronic Invoicing Overview

Companies must send sales invoices, credit memos, finance charge memos, and reminders to the Danish public sector electronically in the Offentlig Information Online UBL (OIOUBL) format. If a company does not send these documents electronically, the authorities can deny payment.  

Learn more about OIOUBL electronic invoicing at [oioubl.info](http://www.oioubl.info/classes/da/index.html).  

## Implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]  

The current requirements for sending electronic invoices are based on OIOUBL, which is based on the Universal Business Language (UBL) version 2.0 standard. Learn more at [OASIS UBL](https://aka.ms/OasisUblSite) web site. The generated XML documents can then be sent to the customer.  

To send documents electronically, you must assign European Article Numbering (EAN) location numbers and account codes to the relevant customers on the **Customer Card** page. Learn more at [Set Up Customers for OIOUBL](how-to-set-up-customers-for-oioubl.md). These numbers are the included when you create documents, and post or issue them. After the documents have been posted or issued, you can create electronic versions to be sent to the customer. You can submit the following types of documents:  

- Sales invoice  
- Service invoice  
- Sales credit memo  
- Service credit memo  
- Finance charge memo  
- Reminder  

In the online version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and the web client for on-premises versions, the XML file is created in your Downloads folder. For on-premises versions, the XML file is stored in the location defined on the Sales & Receivables Setup page.  

## OIOUBL Profiles

Your customers can use a profile that is based on the Danish OIOUBL definitions, or they can use a profile that is based on the OIOUBL implementation of the Northern European Subset (NES) definitions. Some profiles require responses to be sent when an electronic document is received. You can set up which profile most of your customers use. If a customer uses a different profile, you can change that in the customer card. For example, you can specify that the default profile is Procurement-OrdSim-BilSim-1.0, but that customer 10000 requires profile urn:www.nesubl.eu:profiles:profile5:ver2.0. For more information, see [Set Up OIOUBL](how-to-set-up-oioubl.md).  

For more information, see the entry on OIOUBL profiles in the frequently asked questions section at [Digitaliseringsstyrelsen](https://aka.ms/Digitaliseringsstyrelsen).

# Set up digital vouchers in Denmark

Administrators can use digital voucher functionality to require that documents are attached to specific transactions when they're posted. Therefore, this functionality allows for a source-driven approach and provides a better audit trail. Different types of enforcement can be configured for this purpose, depending on the documents or journal types.

The term *digital voucher* refers to a digital or electronic form of a traditional voucher in accounting. A voucher is a document that's used to support and authorize financial transactions. Vouchers typically serve as evidence of an expenditure or a receipt of funds. The voucher might include details such as the date of the transaction, a description, the amount, and any authorization signatures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of July 1, 2024, this feature will be enabled by default in Denmark. You'll then be restricted from doing additional configuration for purchase and sales documents. This restriction applies because the new Danish bookkeeping act mandates specific setups, where you must attach minimum vouchers for purchase and sales documents. Before this date, you can activate this feature in **Feature Management**.  

## Set up digital vouchers

You can use different setups for the following documents and journals.

| Entry type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Sales Document** | Specifies postings that are completed from sales documents. In the Danish localization, this option can't be edited. |
| **Purchase Document** | Specifies postings that are completed from purchase documents. In the Danish localization, this option can't be edited. |
| **General Journal** | Specifies postings from the general journal for all account types, except postings that are related to the customer and vendor. If you select one of those account types, you change control of the posting process. If you select **Customer** as the account Type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup related to the sales journal. If you select **Vendor** as the account type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup related to the purchase journal. |
| **Sales Journal** | Specifies the postings that are completed from the sales journal and the general journal where **Customer** is selected as the account type. |
| **Purchase Journal** | Specifies the postings that are completed from the purchase journal and the general journal where **Vendor** is selected as the account Type. |

Follow these steps to define how your organization uses enforced digital vouchers, beside the steps that are already required by law.

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Entry Setup**, and then select the related link. Alternatively, on the **Digital Voucher Setup** page, select **Entry Setup**.
1. In the **Entry Type** column, select an option.
1. In the **Check Type** column, select an enforcement option. If you select **None**, you can post the selected type of entry without any digital voucher. If you select **Attachment**, the entry must include an attachment. If you select **Attachment or Note**, you can include an attachment or a note for the entry.
1. Select the **Generate Automatically** checkbox to generate the digital voucher automatically. For example, if you don't want to manually add a sales invoice to your transaction, select this checkbox. Then, you just have to post the document. The system automatically creates the document, based on your report layout, and attaches it to the transaction.
1. Select the **Skip If Manually Added** checkbox if you don't want to add an automatically generated digital voucher. This setting is useful if you already added a manual attachment.

### Use source codes for setup

To use enforcement for journals, but not for all transaction types, connect the specific source code to identify the entry type in the general journal, sales journal, or purchase journal.

Follow these steps to set up specific source codes for digital vouchers.

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Entry Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **Digital Voucher Entry Setup** page, select **Source Codes**.
1. Select the source codes that you want to configure.
1. Close the page.

## Use the functionality

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Digital vouchers are enabled by default, and you must retain your vouchers. Retaining vouchers can significantly increase the size of your database. To mitigate this, use lower resolution scans for your purchase invoices. For your sales invoices, create layouts with smaller images or none at all, because attachments are automatically generated based on the layout. All attachments are stored in your database and affect its size, but you can minimize the effect by uploading smaller files.

### Purchase documents

Open one of the purchase documents, and set the required fields. Before you post the document, follow these steps to add a digital voucher.

1. On the document page, in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox, select **Attach File**.
1. Drag a file directly onto the **Insert File** page, or browse to the file from this page.

The document is attached to the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox. For each line, you can find the document name and type.

### Sales documents

Open one of the sales documents, and set the required fields. For sales documents, you don't have to attach a document manually. The system automatically creates an attachment, based on your sales document layout. After you post the document, you can find the automatically created and attached voucher based on your report.

1. In the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox from the document line, select **Incoming Document**.
1. On the **Incoming Document** page, select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> If attachment of a digital voucher is configured as mandatory, and you try to post documents or journals without attaching a voucher, the system prevents you from posting. You receive the following error message: "Not possible to post without attaching the digital voucher."

### Find attached vouchers in transactions

You can find the attachment from the posted document or from the **General Ledger Entries** page by looking in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

You can't delete an attached document after posting is completed. However, you can add more attachments after posting is completed.

# Payroll Data Definitions (DK) extension

If your business uses the Danløn, Dataløn, Lønservice, Multiløn, or Proløn payroll service providers in Denmark, the Payroll Data Definitions (DK) extension can help you quickly and accurately register payroll transactions from these providers. The extension contains data exchange definitions that enable you to import payroll transactions in files that the providers send to you. Learn more in [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](../../across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

## Getting started

The first step is to map the types of payroll transactions to the general ledger accounts that you want to post them to in Business Central. For example, you might want to post retirement plan contributions to an account named Pension, and the taxes paid on the contributions to an account named Pension Tax. This happens outside of Business Central, for example, you might use an Excel worksheet to visualize the mapping. Work with the payroll service provider to ensure that the file they export contains the mapping. Typically, you can find information about how to configure export files on the provider's website.

After you install the extension, the next step is to specify the format for the payroll data file from the payroll service provider. To do that, go to the **General Ledger Setup** page and choose the provider in the **Payroll Trans. Import Format** field.

## Import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the journal to use, and then use the **Import Payroll File** action to import the data file from the payroll service provider.

# Standard audit files - tax

Starting in January, 2020, companies in Norway must report financial data and provide a set of Standard Audit Files - Tax (SAF-T) to the Norwegian authorities upon request. This extension makes it easy to set up, generate, and export Standard Audit Files - Tax in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The exported SAF-T files will automatically be compressed as a .zip file ready to be uploaded by the user on the website of Skatteetaten, the Norwegian tax authorities.  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with version 25.3, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in Norway supports SAF-T versions 1.20 and 1.30, as the newer version will be required in 2025. Earlier versions only support the SAF-T 1.20 format.

## What does this extension handle?

This extension provides the following capabilities:

* Choosing SAF-T version for reporting.
* Setup and mapping of chart of accounts to SAF-T standard accounts.
* Mapping VAT setup to SAF-T VAT codes.
* Control to which extent dimensions are exported in SAF-T files.
* Export SAF-T files, either directly or by using the Job Queue. Using Job Queue lets you schedule the export to occur during quiet hours, which is useful for potentially large datasets.

## Setup of the Norwegian SAF-T extension

Set up the SAF-T extension through Assisted Setup, which provides an easy, step-by-step guide for get started with SAF-T in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. If needed, you can run the guide several times until you finish the setup.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Assisted Setup**.  
2. Choose **Set up SAF-T**.
3. The first page in the setup guide explains what you are about to set up. Choose **Next**.
4. Choose the SAF-T version you want to use for reporting.  
5. In the in **Mapping Type** field, choose the type of Chart of Accounts you want to SAF-T accounts, and then choose **Next**. 

   > [!Note]
   > If you are using the on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are some additional steps.
   > 1. Download and import source files with SAF-T accounts. Download the SAF-T mapping files from [Skatteetaten's repo on Github](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/saf-t).
   > 2. Choose **Import The Source Files For Mapping**.
   > 3. Import all required files. If you are setting up the mapping for income statement import files, make sure to import mapping codes for all records with **Income Statement** in the **Source Type** column.
   > 4. For each imported file, choose **Update mapping codes from file**.

6. To define the period for the first SAF-T reporting, choose **Accounting Period**, confirm the data range, and then choose **Next**.

   Typically, this is done for a specific accounting period, but you can also define a date range without specifying an accounting period.
7. To map your chart of accounts to the SAF-T accounts, choose **Open setup to define G/L account mappings**. Lines where the G/L Account No. is marked with green indicates that here are transactions on the account within the date range specified in the previous step, in which case it must be mapped. Other G/L accounts can be skipped. When finished, close the **SAF-T Mapping Setup Card**, and then choose **Next** in the setup guide.
8. To map the VAT Posting Setup to standard sales and purchase SAF-T tax codes, choose **Open setup to define VAT Posting Setup Mapping**.  When finished close the **SAF-T VAT Posting Setup card**, and then choose **Next** in the setup guide.
9. Norwegian authorities recommend that you export dimensions for financial transactions. However, in some situations you may not want to export dimensions - for example if you have internal dimensions that do provide value to auditors. This step lets you open the Dimensions list and choose which dimensions to export. Choose the value in the **Export to SAF-T** field, and then choose **Close**.
10. To specify the employee who is the SAF-T contact in your company, choose the employee in the **Employee No.** field. This is useful when Norwegian authorities have questions about the SAF-T files. When finished, choose **Next**.
11. The setup of SAF-T is now finished. Choose **Finish**.

> [!Note] 
> The mappings are tied to the date range you specified. You can create additional mappings for other periods without changing the mapping you already created. You can also copy mappings from previously made setups. This is to ensure that you can report SAF-T for different periods while managing changes in your chart of accounts.

## Exporting SAF-T files

To export SAF-T files from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must first create and set up a **SAF-T Export** to define the mapping range. For example, you can define a mapping and export the entire year of 2019, and another mapping for just the month of April 2019 if the authorities ask you to provide this data specifically.

### To create an export of SAF-T files

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SAF-T Exports**, and then choose **SAF-T Exports**.  
2. On the **SAF-T Exports** page, choose **Create**.
3. On the **SAF-T Export** page, choose the SAF-T version and in the **Mapping Range Code** field, choose the mapping range for which to define an export.
4. To start the SAF-T export, do one of the following: 
   * To export immediately, choose **Start**.
   * To schedule the export to be handled by the jobs in the Job Queue, choose **Parallel Processing**. Exporting G/L entries can take time. To speed up the process, consider specifying how many jobs to run in parallel. 
5. To check the status of the SAF-T file generation, look at the **Lines** section in the lower part of this page. 
6. When all files are generated, choose **Download file** to download a .zip file that contains the SAF-T files. This file is ready to be uploaded to Skatteetaten.

### SAF-T files and data quality

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with extra data quality validation controls that help make sure that your SAF-T files can be validated by Skatteetaten. For example, SAF-T files can only be validated when certain information exists on relevant records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. To help ensure data quality for SAF-T you can enable more proactive controls on the **Data Quality** FastTab on the **SAF-T Setup** page. Additionally, on the **SAF-T Export** card page, use the **Data check** action to check the data quality before you export the file.

> [!NOTE]
> SAF-T exports will by default generate one file with master data, and separate files for each of the months included in the selected mapping range. Consider the amount of transactions in the selected period and adjust the **Max No. of Jobs** accordingly on the SAF-T Export page. As a general recommendation, start with three parallel jobs to allow parallel export and still leave resources for other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] users. Additionally, for on-premises, you can specify a network share in the **Folder path** to generate the SAF-T files directly on a network share instead of using the database. For online versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] this is always the case. If you specify the **Folder Name**, the generated .zip file will be located here. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the nature of exporting transactions, exporting SAF-T files will impact performance of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

There are a couple of things you can do to improve performance:

* **Split by Date** option

   This approach collects general ledger entries by date, not by month as is the default with better performance as a result. 
   
* **XML** option

   For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you have an option to not generate .ZIP files from the export. This will export the raw XML files and is only possible where there is a **Folder Path** to export to. The user can then compress the files manually, which saves server performance. SAF-T files can be large and compressing them to a .ZIP file is a costly operation for the server. 
   
* **Create Multiple Zip Files** option

Finally, for both online and on-premises, for very large exports with many transactions, you can also use the option to create multiple .ZIP files. This is useful if individual files per month are very large, or the count of files per date is too big. Use this option when the single large ZIP file will not validate on the authorities' web site due to its size, for example. Using this feature will split up the export into multiple ZIP files, up to 10 in alignment with the requirements that are stated in the general SAF-T documentation. The **SAF-T Export File** page is always opened when using the **Download File** action. Here you can see how many files were generated and download them one by one.

# Set Up Document Printing
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can print the sales reports that use the required giro specifications by using different paper types and paper trays.  

When you use tray numbers and paper sources for Norwegian sales documents, you must consider how the printer and printer driver interpret this information. You may have to specify other tray numbers for your specific printer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  KID information will also print where the giro information is printed.  

The following documents require a printed giro:  

- Invoices  
- Credit memos  
- Finance charge memos  
- Reminders  

The Norwegian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] contains the following sets of sales documents.  

|**Set**|Description|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|1|The standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] documents. No giro information is printed.|  
|2|The giro is printed on every page. The last page prints the giro total.|  

## To set up paper trays  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Selections**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the report.  
3.  Choose the **Sales Document Paper Tray Setup** action.  
4.  Select a paper source from the **First Page - Paper Source** field.  
5.  The **First Page – Tray Number** field will automatically display the selected paper source. You can also manually enter a tray number.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Not all printers will have the same paper source names. You can specify a number in the **Tray Number** field. The number may correspond to a paper source. To find the number that a specific printer is using, see the technical documentation for the printer.  

    The **Other Pages** and **Giro Page** fields are set up the same way.  

6.  Choose the **OK** button.

# Electronic Payments to Vendors in Norway
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Norwegian enhancements for automatically making payments to vendors. This reduces errors that occur from manual data entry. You can use this functionality to perform the following operations:  

- Search invoices that are due based on different conditions.  
- Send payments to the bank.  
- Receive messages from the bank on the status of payments.  
- Receive paid transaction information to be posted.  

You can make electronic payments using the following formats:  

- TelePay  
- Remittance payment  

## Electronic Payment Process  
The following steps show how electronic payments are processed:  

1.  The payment proposal is run in the electronic payments feature and transferred to the bank by using the bank’s software.  
2.  The bank's software receives the payments and transfers payments to the bank.  
3.  The bank receives the payments and sends the first-time return receipt to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] using the bank's software.  
4.  The bank executes the payments and sends the settlement return (second-time return receipt) to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] using the bank's software where the payments are posted.  

## Vendor Payment Requirements  
If the payment transactions do not fulfill the requirements, an error message appears and you cannot create a payment file for transfers to the bank. The following criteria must be met when you process payments to vendors:  

- The payment transaction must be positive or zero. A payment transaction must transfer a positive amount (or zero) to the payment receiver. This means that deducting a credit memo requires an invoice with the same or higher amount in the same payment transaction. Money cannot be deducted from the vendor's account.  

- A credit memo must be applied with the invoice. Generally a credit memo does not contain a Kunde ID (KID). You cannot pay a credit memo in a payment transaction with invoices that contain a KID. This is because payments are usually split into transactions with or without a KID. This means that if a credit memo without a KID is paid with an invoice in the same payment transaction, the invoice must be paid without a KID, and the recipient reference number must be used instead.  

- If the invoice and credit memo are paid in the same payment transaction, the payment must occur on the same date using the same currency and exchange rate.

# Remittance errors in the Norwegian version

Remittance errors for payments might occur when data is transferred and after payments are sent to the bank. Both kinds of errors are reported on the **Return Error** page.  

The remittance system handles all error codes, which can be sent through the return files. It isn't required to manually cancel payments rejected by the bank.  

## Types of errors  
There are two types of remittance errors:  

- Transfer error  
- Rejection  

## Transfer errors  
If errors occur during transfer and no return data is created, the bank didn't receive the payments.  

If the payment file can't be sent to the bank, you must cancel the payment order in the remittance system.  

## Rejections  
If there's an error or information is missing with a payment that was sent to the bank, the return contains a rejection of the payment.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Rejections vary from bank to bank. Contact your bank regarding how to handle rejection of payments.  

If there's a rejection, the error code from the bank and an explanation is displayed for the payment on the **Waiting Journal** page. You have to handle the rejection based how the remittance agreement was set up. For more information, see [Set Up Remittance Agreements](how-to-set-up-remittance-agreements.md).

# Set Up Vendors for Remittance in the Norwegian Version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Norwegian enhancements for automatically making payments to vendors. This reduces errors that occur from manual data entry. To pay vendors using the remittance system, you must set up vendor information.  

## To set up a vendor for remittance  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

# Types of payment returns files in the Norwegian version
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes two types of payment return files that can be imported:  

- Receipt returns  
- Settlement returns  

You can also choose to not use return files by selecting the **Return File Is Not In Use** field in the **Remittance Agreement** table. For more information, see [Set Up Remittance Agreements](how-to-set-up-remittance-agreements.md).  

## Receipt returns  
The receipt return is received from the bank after you send the remittance file to the bank. When data is imported, information about the number of invoices that are received correctly, and the number that are received with error is displayed. After you import a receipt return, the status of the payments in the **Waiting Journal** table is set to **Approved**.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You may also receive a rejected return from the bank. If the remittance is rejected, the settlement return will not be received.  

## Settlement returns  
The settlement return is received from the bank after the payment is executed. When data is imported, information about the number of settled invoices is displayed.  

The following occurs when the settlement return is imported:  

- Payment status in the **Waiting Journal** table is set to **Settled**.  
- Information is transferred from the **Waiting Journal** page to the payment journal.  
- A balancing account is created for each transaction.  
- Document numbers are inserted for each transaction.  

## Exchange rates by settlement  
For a payment, the exchange rates are managed in the following ways:  

- Payment from an account in local currency - If a payment in another currency is from an account in LCY, the bank flags the settlement return with a warning about the exchange rate between LCY and the currency that is used as payment.  

- Payment from a currency account - If payment is made from a currency account, the exchange rate for this currency and LCY is used. This is because the bank doesn't inform the system about the exchange rate.  

## Warnings on settlement returns  
When the settlement return is imported, warnings can occur. Payment journal lines with warnings are marked with a symbol. To view the information about the warning, you can open the **Settlement Info** page.

# Export remittance payments in the Norwegian version

You can use the export remittance payments process to export the payments file to your computer. You can then transfer the remittance payments to the bank.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you can export a remittance payment, you must select a payment format in the **Payment Export Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

You export payments to a bank file by choosing the **Export Payments** button on the **Payment Journal** page. The process might be different, depending on the export format that you select:  

- Payments using the SEPA payment standard are directly exported to a file when you choose the **Export Payments** button. For more information, see [Making Payments](../../payables-make-payments.md).  

- Payments using local payment standards, such as **Telepay**, are exported with either the **Remittance - export (bank)** or the **Remittance - export (BBS)** report, which automatically opens when you choose the **Export Payments** button.  

The procedure for exporting payments using the **Remittance – Export** batch job is described in this article.  

## To export remittance payments using the remittance - Export batch jobs  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Prepare to export the payments from the journal. For more information, see [Export Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).  
3.  Choose the **Export Payments** action.  
4.  In the report page that opens, choose the **Options** FastTab, and fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Remittance agreement code**|Specify the code for the agreement.|  
    |**Operator**|Specify the operator number.|  
    |**Password**|Specify the password for the payments.|  
    |**Division**|Specify the division that is paying remittance.|  
    |**Current note**|Specify a note for the payment.|  
    |**Filename**|Specify the name and directory of the payment file.|  

5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

The payment information is exported to the file that is set up in the remittance agreement.  

The payment journal is deleted and the transactions are transferred to the waiting journal.

# Electronic invoicing in Norway

Companies must send sales invoices and credit memos to the Norwegian public sector electronically in the Elektronisk Handelsformat (EHF) based on Universal Business Language (UBL). If a company doesn't send these documents electronically, the authorities can deny payment. The standard supported format for electronic exchange between parties is the Ehandel.no format. To learn more about EHF electronic invoicing, go to [Anskaffelser.no](https://www.anskaffelser.no).  

## New E-Documents framework

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality connected to external endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you use the features that this article describes, install the **E-Documents Connector with External Endpoints** app or another connector to use on the top of the global **E-Document Core** app. This app can be used for default integration with the external (non-Microsoft) access points to automate the e-document flow.

### Set up the connection

[!INCLUDE [edocuments-connectors-include](../../includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

Based on the endpoint service provider you chose, the next steps might be different. For details about the setup parameters for all available service providers, go to [Connect E-Documents to external access points](../../finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

### Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to the usual fields, you must also fill in the fields as described in the following table:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

### Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer.
3. In addition to the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents.
4. Mark the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** field to indicate whether the global location number (GLN) is used as a party identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

### Other setups

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the workflows and document sending profiles to use. After you create the service connection, you can use your e-document solution.

### Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors to our **E-Document Core** framework.

Currently, there are only a couple of access point providers, and Microsoft has no contractual obligations with them. To get the credentials required to use the access points, contact the providers.

We'll update this list as we get new e-document exchange access point providers.

## Legacy electronic invoicing

This article describes the legacy features for electronic invoicing localized for use in Norway. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] offers an improved e-documents framework that we recommend you use instead.  

### Implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]  

From January 2019, the requirements for sending electronic invoices are based on the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 standard. For more information, see the [EHF Billing 3.0](https://anskaffelser.dev/postaward/g3/spec/current/billing-3.0/norway/) page from the Agency of Public Management and eGovernment. Companies that are already sending electronic documents in the pre-2019 format can continue to do so during 2019.

> [NOTE!]
> You can use the [Anskaffelser.dev Validator](https://anskaffelser.dev/service/validator) to validate your EHF billing formats.  

To send documents electronically, you must assign European Article Numbering (EAN) location numbers and account codes to the relevant customers on the **Customer Card** page. For more information, see [Set up customers for EHF](how-to-set-up-customers-for-ehf.md). These numbers are included when you create, post, or issue documents. After documents are posted or issued, you can create electronic versions to send to customers.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] exports certain electronic documents in EHF version 3.0, which uses UBL version 2.1. You can submit the following types of documents:  

- Sales and service invoices
- Sales and service credit memos

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] exports other electronic documents in version 1.6, which uses UBL version 2.0. You can submit the following types of documents:  

- Finance charge memo  
- Reminder  

You can specify where to store electronic documents on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. You can also use the [Document exchange functionality](../../across-how-to-set-up-electronic-document-sending-and-receiving.md) to generate and send them.

## VAT treatment  

VAT percentages and the type of transaction determine the VAT Type that is exported in the electronic document.  

|XML|Type| 
|---------|----------|  
|S|Outgoing VAT, ordinary rate|
|H|Outgoing VAT, reduced rate – food and beverage|
|R|Outgoing VAT, reduced rate – raw fish|
|AA|Outgoing VAT, low rate|
|AE|VAT Reverse Charge|
|L|Canary Islands general indirect tax|
|M|Tax for production, services, and importation in Ceuta and Melilla|
|G|Free export item, tax not charged|
|O|Services outside scope of tax|
|E|VAT Exempt|
|Z|VAT Exempt (goods and services not included in the VAT regulations)|
|K|VAT exempt for European Economic Area (EEA) intra-community supply of goods and services|

## VAT scheme

Make sure you set up the correct value in the **VAT Scheme** field on the **Countries/Regions** page.

# The Payroll Data Definitions Extension in the Norwegian Version

If your business uses the Huldt & Lillevik Lønn - Visma payroll service provider in Norway, the **Payroll Data Definitions (NO)** extension can help you quickly and accurately register payroll transactions from these providers. The extension contains data exchange definitions that enable you to import payroll transactions in files that the providers send to you. For more information about data exchange definitions, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](../../across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).   

## Getting Started

The first step is to map the types of payroll transactions to the general ledger accounts that you want to post them to in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you might want to post retirement plan contributions to an account named Pension, and the taxes paid on the contributions to an account named Pension Tax. This happens outside of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], for example, you might use an Excel worksheet to visualize the mapping. Work with the payroll service provider to ensure that the file they export contains the mapping. Typically, you can find information about how to configure export files on the provider's website.  

After you install the extension, the next step is to specify the format for the payroll data file from the payroll service provider. To do that, go to the **General Ledger Setup** page and choose the provider in the **Payroll Trans. Import Format** field.  

## To import a payroll file

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.   
2.  Choose the journal to use, and then use the **Import Payroll File** action to import the data file from the payroll service provider.

# Create manual remittance payments in the Norwegian version

Generally, payments are created automatically in the payment journal using the remittance suggestion function. However, you can also create a payment manually, either as a payment of an existing invoice or as a payment without a link to an existing invoice, such as a payment to a vendor.  

## To create a manual remittance payment  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Info**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Info** page, choose the **Initialize Payment Info** action.  

    If the payment is linked to an existing vendor ledger entry, information is transferred from the entry. If the payment isn't linked to a vendor ledger entry, only partial information is created.  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# Recipient reference codes in the Norwegian version

The recipient reference code determines the message that is sent to the recipient. The code is displayed on the remittance account and is used for vendors that are paid from this account. For each vendor, a special recipient reference code can be created if the general reference text isn't used.  

The text in recipient reference fields can be formatted automatically with special codes. For example, if you enter **Payment of Invoice %2** in a recipient reference field, the information that prints is **Payment of Invoice 10000**.  

The recipient reference codes are described in the following table.  

|**Code**|Description|  
|--------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**%1**|The document type. Either invoice or credit memo.|  
|**%2**|The vendor's invoice number.|  
|**%3**|The **Our Account No.** field from the **Vendor Card** page. This is usually the customer number that is used by the vendor.|  
|**%4**|The invoice or credit memo number.|  
|**%5**|The description from the vendor ledger entry.|  
|**%6**|The original amount from the vendor ledger entries. The amount is shown as positive.|  
|**%7**|The remaining amount from the vendor ledger entries. The amount is shown as positive.|  
|**%8**|The local currency amount from the vendor ledger entry. The amount is shown as positive.|  
|**%9**|The currency code from the vendor ledger entry.|  
|**%10**|The due date from the vendor ledger entry.|  
|**%11**|The Kunde ID number from the vendor ledger entry.|

# Proportional VAT in Norway
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to calculate VAT when there is both deductible and non-deductible VAT. Because it is difficult to know where and how an item is used, you will have to contact the Norwegian tax authorities to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible based on historical data.  

## Example  
A bus company owns both buses and trucks. When gasoline is purchased, the gasoline is stored in one holding tank. When the gasoline is used in a bus for transporting children, it is not deductible. When the gasoline is used in a truck, the gasoline may be deductible. The agreement between the bus company and the Norwegian tax authorities might be that 60 percent of the VAT is deductible.  

If you have a purchase invoice of $12,500 based on 25 percent VAT with the **Calc. Prop. Deduction VAT** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page set to **Yes** and the **Proportional Deduction VAT %** field set to **60 percent**, only 60 percent of the VAT is deductible in a journal. When the invoice is posted, the postings are as follows:  

- To vendor general ledger account - $12,500 (credit)  
- To cost account 4010 - $11,000 (debit)  
- To VAT account 2720 - $1,500 (debit)  

Generally, based on 25 percent VAT, the VAT amount would be $2,500. However, only 60 percent is deductible; therefore the VAT amount is $2,500 x 60% = $1,500. The non-deductible amount of $1,000 is added to the cost account. The VAT base has corresponding values. This amount should have been $10,000, but because only 60 percent is deductible, the base is $6,000.  

This also works if the transaction with this VAT combination is posted through a purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If this functionality is used on a purchase order that is used for buying items for inventory, the functionality will not influence the cost of the item. The cost of the item will be added by using the non-deductible VAT. This works on the general ledger level only.

# Test Remittance Payments in the Norwegian Version

After you have set up remittance payments and generated suggestions, you can test the payment journal lines for errors before posting them.  

To test the payment journal lines, you can use the **Remittance Test** report. This report prints an overview of all journal lines together with any errors, such as missing fields or incorrect bank accounts.  

If a warning is printed in the test report, you cannot transfer the payments to the bank before the problem is corrected. You should print the test report to make sure that all payments are made as expected.  

## To print a remittance test report  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Test Report** action.  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Show Dimensions** field to print dimensions on the test report.  
4.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

# Calculate proportional VAT in the Norwegian version
You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's both deductible and non-deductible  VAT. Because it's difficult to know where and how an item is used, you have to contact the Norwegian tax authorities to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible, based on historical data.  

### To calculate proportional VAT  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Calc. Prop. Deduction VAT**|Select to indicate that you want to use the proportional VAT percentage. **Important:**  This field is available on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, but it isn't shown by default. [!INCLUDE[bp_customize](../../includes/bp_customize_md.md)]|  
    |**Proportional Deduction VAT %**|Enter the percentage of VAT to deduct.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button.

# Norwegian VAT Codes

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], VAT processing information can be easily set up using standard Norwegian VAT codes. The following table shows the standard Norwegian VAT codes.  

|**Code**|**Description**|  
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|  
|**0**|Sale - No VAT|  
|**1**|Purchase - VAT|  
|**2**|Purchase - VAT and Inv. Tax|  
|**3**|Sale - VAT|  
|**4**|Purchase - VAT and 0% Inv. Tax|  
|**11**|Purchase - Full VAT|  
|**13**|Sale - Full VAT|  
|**14**|Purchase - Reverse Charge VAT|  

Typically, you enter the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields when you specify the VAT handling process.  

If you want to use only the **VAT Code** field when you specify the VAT handling process, you can assign a VAT code in the **VAT Posting Setup** table, and use this code instead of the posting group fields. The VAT code can be used as a shortcut in the **VAT Posting Setup** table and at the same time, you can use standard Norwegian VAT codes.  

## Set Up of Norwegian VAT Codes  
You must create the Norwegian VAT codes on the **VAT Codes** page. Then assign the VAT codes in the **VAT Posting Setup** table, using the **VAT Code** field. For more information, see [Use One VAT Code in Journals](how-to-use-one-vat-code-in-journals.md).  

## Use of VAT Codes  
When you specify a VAT code, you can select the VAT posting setup information for this code. This information will be used in journals or on document lines when you specify the VAT setup information. If you use the VAT code in these cases, the posting group fields are used with the information from the corresponding VAT posting setup information.  

Alternatively, you will have to specify both the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields when you select or change the VAT posting setup information on the journal line or the document line.  

### Example: Using VAT Codes  
There are two different VAT posting setup instances that can be used when you post a sales document.  

One VAT posting setup scenario will calculate 24 percent VAT for domestic customers:  

- VAT Bus. Posting Group: DOMESTIC  
- VAT Prod. Posting Group: NORMAL  
- VAT %: 24  
- VAT Code: 3  

One VAT posting setup scenario will calculate without VAT for international customers:  

- VAT Bus. Posting Group: EXPORT  
- VAT Prod. Posting Group: NORMAL  
- VAT %: 0  
- VAT Code: 1  

Typically, when you specify the VAT setup information on a journal line, the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field must be set to **DOMESTIC** and the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field must be set to **NORMAL** in order to choose the domestic setup.  

If you use standard Norwegian VAT codes, you could specify **VAT Code 3** for the domestic VAT posting setup information, and **VAT Code 1** for the international VAT posting setup information. This lets you choose between the VAT posting setup information using only one field and the familiar standard Norwegian VAT codes.  

### Example: Restricting the Use of VAT Codes  
The standard Norwegian **VAT Code 3** is used for sales inclusive of VAT. Unless you restrict the use of this VAT code, it can be used for both sales and purchases in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can define the **Gen. Posting Type** field as a sale in the **G/L Account (Analysis View)** table. This general posting type will be used together with **VAT Code 3**.  

The general posting type will be handled in two ways, depending on the value in the **Test Gen. Posting Type** field.  

|Option|Description|  
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
|**Mandatory**|The general posting type is automatically set to **Sale** on journal lines. Before you post, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies if the general posting type is specified, but there is no verification if the field is set to **Sale**.<br /><br /> **VAT Code 3** can be used for both sales and purchase documents.|  
|**Same**|The general posting type is automatically set to **Sale** on journal lines. Before you post, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies if the general posting type is set to **Sale**.<br /><br /> **VAT Code 3** can be used for sales documents, but not on purchase documents.<br /><br /> This enables you to restrict the use of VAT codes to predefined general posting types.|

# Electronic banking in Norway
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Norwegian enhancements to electronic banking. You can use this functionality to perform the following operations:  

- Receive electronic payments based on an optical character recognition (OCR) payment ID.  
- Print Kunde ID (KID) numbers on sales and receivables documents.  
- Send electronic payments to vendors.  

## Customer identification numbers  
 Kunde ID (KID) is a customer identification number that provides a payment reference to the vendor and ensures that the vendor is posting the payment correctly. If the vendor documents include the KID number, you should use this number as there might be a higher cost for the payment if you don't.  

 The KID can be entered in the following locations:  

- Sales invoices  
- Finance charge memos

# Norwegian Giro and OCR-B font
A General Interbank Recurring Order (giro) is a payment system that operates like a credit transfer.  

The last line on the giro uses the OCR-B font. Bankenes Betalingssentral (BBS) requires this to be used with optical character recognition (OCR) when handling payments from customers. For more information, see the [Brukehåndbok Indbetalingstjeneste (NO).pdf](https://www.nets.eu/no-nb/SiteCollectionDocuments/Egiro/Brukehåndbok%20Innbetalingstjenestene%20(NO).pdf) on the NETS.eu website.  

The OCR-B-10 BT font is generally available from software vendors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], Norwegian sales documents use the OCR-B-10 BT font from BitStream Inc. on the giro. For more information, see the fonts.com website at [OCR-B-10 BT](https://www.fonts.com/font/bitstream/ocr-b-bt/10).  

You can use any OCR-B font, but if other fonts are used, a Microsoft Certified Partner is required to update the sales documents. Contact your partner for more information.

# Create Electronic Documents for EHF
When you sell goods or services to a customer in the public sector, you must submit documents electronically.  In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create electronic documents for invoices, credit memos, reminders, and finance charge memos. Before you can create the electronic documents, you must have set up file locations and information about the customers. For more information, see [Set Up EHF](how-to-set-up-ehf.md) and [Set Up Customers for EHF](how-to-set-up-customers-for-ehf.md).

Electronic documents can only be created after a document has been posted or issued. The following procedures describe how to post a sales invoice with the required information and then create an electronic sales invoice, but the same steps also apply to sales credit memos, reminders, finance charge memos, service invoices, and service credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The sum of lines in an exported electronic document will not reflect invoice rounding, even if it is enabled. Instead, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] sums the lines without rounding.  

## To post a sales invoice  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the sales invoice that you want to post, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, make sure that the following fields contain values:  

    - **External Document No.**  
    - **Your Reference**  

    The **External Document No.** field contains the document number that the customer provided.  

4.  On the **Invoicing** FastTab, make sure that the following fields have values:  

    - **GLN No.**  
    - **Account Code**  
    - **Bill-to Customer**  
    - **Shipment Date**  

    Select the **E-Invoice** check box.  

    The default value of the **Shipment Date** field is the posting date of the document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For reminders and finance charge memos, the **GLN No.**, **Account Code**, and **E-Invoice** fields are on the **Posting** FastTab.  

5.  Choose the **Post** action to post the invoice.  

## To create an electronic sales invoice  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the relevant sales invoice.  
3.  Choose the **Create Electronic Invoice** action.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The **E-Invoice** check box must be selected on the invoice in order to create an electronic invoice.  

4.  Optionally, in the **Create Electronic Invoices** batch job page, set additional filters.  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

An XML file is created and stored at the location that was defined on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. You can now submit the document to the customer.

# Recurring orders
You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.  

You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. For more information, see [Create Recurring Orders](how-to-create-recurring-orders.md).
