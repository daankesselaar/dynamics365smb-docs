# Set Up Complex Application Areas Using Best Practices
Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software.  

 Whether you use Rapid Start to implement setup values or you manually enter them in the new company, you can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

 Help in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes best-practice information about how to set up key fields in the following application areas:  

-   [Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning](setup-best-practices-supply-planning.md)  

-   [Setup Best Practices: Costing Method](setup-best-practices-costing-method.md)

# Exchanging Data
You can exchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external files or streams in connection with common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the data files or streams. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, and the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you distribute bank file conversions to an external service provider. For more information, see [Setting Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Walkthrough conducting a sales campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This increases the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers (contacts) in a follow-up campaign.  

 The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales & Marketing department. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Preparing the data.
- Setting up a campaign.  
- Selecting the target audience.  
- Mining data.  
- Sending letters to contacts.  
- Registering campaign responses.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager  
- Marketing Staffer  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. The marketing manager also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting up a campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the target audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use various criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too large. The manager decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to focus on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a segment to a campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending letters and email messages to contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

> [!NOTE]  
> If needed click on the **Edit Pencil** icon to open the page in edit mode.

1. Open the **Segment** card for the **Visitors at the FUTURUS trade show**.  
2. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template code **BUS** and select **Yes**.
3. Choose the **Language Code (Default)** field to open the **Segment Interaction Languages** page. Select a **Language Code** and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Make sure that the **Correspondence Type (Default)** is set to **Hard Copy**.
5. In the **Attachment** field, select the **Ellipsis** box. This opens the Import Attachment dialog.
    1. Select the **Choose** button to choose your file.
    1. Find the file and select the **Open** button to attach it.
6. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**. Select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to leave the field, and select the **Yes** button.
7. Slide the **Send Word Docs as Attmt** to on and select the **Yes** button.
8. Choose the action **Log**. In the Log Segment pop-up window enable:
 **Create Follow-up Segment**
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the **Log Segment batch job**.  

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.  

Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Interaction Log Entries**, and then choose the related link. There's an entry for each sent letter.  

### To send an email message to a contact  

1. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template, code **BUS**.  
2. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**.  
3. In the **Correspondence Type** field, choose **E-Mail**.  
4. Specify language settings, and attach a Word document, as in the previous procedure.  
5. Choose the **Log** action. The **Log Segment** page opens.  
6. Select the **Send Attachments** check box to have the attachments sent by email.  
7. Select the **Create Follow-up Segment** check box.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

 The letters are automatically sent by email, and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is saved in the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Register campaign responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and records these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.  

 There's no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns. Therefore, create a new template.  

2. On the **Interaction Templates** dropdown, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter **RESP**, and in the **Description** field, enter **Campaign Responses**.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to apply this interaction template code to all segment lines.
6. On the **Campaign** FastTab, select the **Campaign Response** field. Choose **Yes** to confirm the message *You have modified Campaign Response*.  
7. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Log** action.  
8. On the **Log Segment** page, clear the **Send Attachments** check box. Then choose the **OK** button to confirm the message that the segment has been logged.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# Remove and reapply item ledger entries
On the **Application Worksheet** page, you can view and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.  

When you post a transaction where items are moved in or out of inventory, an item application is created between each inventory increase and inventory decrease. These applications determine the flow of costs from the goods that are received in inventory to the cost of goods going out of inventory. Because of the way the unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and a skewed unit cost. For more information, see Design Details: Item Application.

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries:

- You have forgotten to make a fixed application.
- You have made an incorrect fixed application.
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied.

If possible, use a document to reapply an item ledger entry. For example, if you must make a purchase return of an item to which a sale has already been applied, you can reapply by creating and posting the purchase return document by using the correct application in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return line. You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function or the **Copy from Document** function in the purchase return document to make this easier. When you post the document, the item ledger entry is automatically reapplied. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

If you can't use a document to reapply, such as when you have to correct a fixed application, then use the **Application Worksheet** page to correct an application.

> [!Warning]  
> The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet:
    - You should not leave application entries unapplied for long periods of time because other users cannot process the items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. Users who try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry receive the following error message: “You cannot perform this action because entries for item XXX are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user XXX.”
    - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items.
    - When you close the application worksheet, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performs a check to make sure that all entries are applied. For example, if you remove a quantity application but do not create a new application, and then you close the application worksheet, a new application is created. This helps keep the cost intact. However, if you remove a fixed application, a new fixed application is not automatically created when you close the worksheet. You must do this manually by creating a new application in the worksheet.
    - It is possible to remove applications from more than one entry at a time in the application worksheet. However, because applying entries affects the set of entries that are available for application, you cannot create an application for more than one entry at a time.
    - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation: If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply, the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information.

## To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  Enter filters on the **General** FastTab to make it easier to find the item ledger entry for which you want to change the application.  
4.  Select the item ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page opens to show the item ledger entry or entries that are currently applied to the selected entry.  
5.  Select the item ledger entry for which you want to remove the application.  
6.  Choose the **Remove Application** action. This removes the item application entry that links the two item ledger entries and moves it to the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  
7.  Close the **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page.  

 The **Remaining Quantity** field of the two item ledger entries is increased by the quantity that has been unapplied. The removed item ledger entry is now available for reapplication on the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not leave application entries unapplied for longer periods of time because other users cannot process the affected items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. The following error message is displayed if you try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry:  
>   
>  **You cannot perform this action because entries for item \<item\> are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user \<user\>.**  

## To reapply an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  To reapply entries that were removed since the worksheet was opened, select the item ledger entry that you want to reapply, and then choose the **Reapply** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This reapplication to the original balance also occurs automatically when you close the **Application Worksheet** page.  
4.  To apply an available open item ledger entry to another entry, select the item ledger entry that you want to apply. Choose the **Unapplied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page opens.  
5.  Select one or more item ledger entries that you want to apply to the entry selected on the **Application Worksheet** page, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     An item application entry is created between the two item ledger entries. The **Remaining Quantity** fields of the two entries are reduced by the applied quantity.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have chosen to make an application that would create an infinite loop in the cost adjustment process, then the application that you proposed is not made. This can occur when the original entries created negative stock. The application is not made. Therefore, you must select a different entry for the application.  
6.  If the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field in the **Inventory Setup** is set to **Always**, then the cost adjustment batch job is automatically run after you make a reapplication. Otherwise, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to make sure that all costs are up to date.

# Merge duplicate records

As different users create new customer, vendor, or contact cards over time, or the new records are created automatically during migration, a customer, vendor, or contact may be represented in the system with more than one record. In this case, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and provides functions to select which values to keep or discard when merging two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, a duplicate is indicated by the page showing very few fields. Whereas, if the page shows many fields, then the suspected record is probably not a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor  and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you have opened, indicated in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only, however, if merge conflicts exist, you'll resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field will then be transferred to the current record when you complete the process.
6. When you have finished selecting which values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    The system checks if the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes any conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all usage of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table will be replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge.** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which will appear if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Maintain fixed assets

Maintenance costs are operating expenses for the things you do to preserve the condition of your fixed assets. Unlike capital improvements, maintenance doesn't increase the value of your assets.

Each time you send a fixed asset for service, you record information such as the service date, the vendor who did the work, and the service agent's phone number. You enter maintenance information on several pages:

* Fixed Asset Card
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Invoice
* Fixed Asset G/L Journal

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** action to recalculate maintenance costs.

## Record a maintenance cost directly on a fixed asset

Every time you do maintenance for an asset, such as a service visit, you can record it on the **Maintenance Registrations** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to record maintenance for, and then choose the **Maintenance Registration** action.
3. On the **Maintenance Registration** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Post maintenance costs from a fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Book List**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that is assigned to the fixed asset, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, make sure the **Maintenance** checkbox isn't selected so that you don't post maintenance costs to the general ledger.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
6. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Maintenance**.
7. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for maintenance posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Step 7 only works if you set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Maintenance Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Maintenance Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
8. Choose the **Post** action.

## Record maintenance cost from a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to record maintenance costs for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for purchase orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
4. In the **No.** field, choose the asset, and then specify the quantity and cost.
5. In the **FA Posting Type** field, choose **Maintenance**.
6. Post the purchase invoice.

## Follow up on service visits

You can print the **Maintenance - Next Service** report to list the assets that are scheduled for service. You can also use this report when you want to update the **Next Service Date** field on fixed asset cards.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Maintenance Next Service**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields.  
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.


## Monitor maintenance costs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing fixed assets maintenance.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed asset maintenance, go to [Fixed assets maintenance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-maintenance-reports).

### Overview of maintenance costs

You can view statistics to monitor maintenance costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset you want to view maintenance costs for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.
3. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, select the relevant fixed asset depreciation book, and then choose the **Statistics** action.
4. On the **Fixed Asset Statistics** page, choose the **Maintenance** field.

Use the **Maintenance Ledger Entries** page to view the entries that make up the amount in the **Maintenance** field.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Maintenance Analysis**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

To learn more, go to [Maintenance - Analysis](reports/report-5630.md).

## View maintenance ledger entries

You can also explore maintenance costs by viewing the maintenance ledger entries.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view ledger entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.
3. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, select the relevant fixed asset depreciation book, and then choose the **Maintenance Ledger Entries** action.

## View or print maintenance ledger entries for multiple fixed assets

In the **Maintenance - Details** report, you can view or print maintenance ledger entries for one or many fixed assets.

# Report selection for documents in Business Central

You can set up default reports to use to print sales, purchases, and service documents, such as orders, quotes, and invoices, and which layout is used. For example, if you have a specific layout for sales invoices, you can specify that report in the **Report Selections - Sales** page. You can then use the report when you send or print sales invoices.  

## Available report selections

The **Report Selections** pages specify the reports to print in different situations and the layout to use. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides default configurations, but you can change them if needed. You can also add reports to the **Report Selection** pages if you want to print more than one report per document type, for example.

The following table describes where you can find information about the different pages.  

|Area or task  |Learn more|

|Define reports for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Germany)|[Set Up Reports for VAT and Intrastat](LocalFunctionality/Germany/how-to-set-up-reports-for-vat-and-intrastat.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can include additional **Report Selection** pages, depending on your location and industry, for example. To check your setup, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selection**, then choose the relevant link.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following **Report Selection** pages:

* **Report Selection - Sales**  
* **Report Selection - Project**  
* **Report Selection - Service**
* **Report Selection - Purchase**  
* **Report Selection - Cash Flow**  
* **Report Selection - Warehouse**  
* **Report Selection - Inventory**  
* **Report Selection - Bank Account**  
* **Report Selection - Production Order**  
* **Report Selection - Reminder/Finance Charge**  

## Example: Report selection for sales documents

The **Report Selection - Sales** page offers default reports to use in different scenarios for each related document type. Choose a document type in the **Usage** field, then add or review the report selection. You can set up more than one report and specify the sequence the reports must be sent or printed in.  

[!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can't send all document types as email attachments. For the document types you can, the **Report Selection** page contains extra fields.  

For example, on the **Report Selection - Sales** and **Report Selection - Purchase** pages, the following fields help you set up email:

|Field name |Description  |
|-----------|-------------|
|**Use for Email Body**| Insert summarized information, such as the invoice number, due date, or a link to a payment service in an email.|
|**Use for Email Attachment**| Attach the related document to the email.|
|**Email Body Layout Description**|Specify the email body layout to use. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |
|**Report Layout**|Specify the layout to use for the report. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |

# Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|
|Posted documents|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|Posted direct transfer|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|
|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

## To transfer items with the item reclassification journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Reclass. Journal** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the items are currently stored.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To transfer items that have no location code, leave the **Location Code** field blank.
4. In the **New Location Code** field, enter the location that you want to transfer the items to.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

# Development of Validated Localization apps

This article describes the requirements and guidelines for developing a Validated Localization app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is a Validated Localization app?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available [globally in 170+ markets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json). In some markets, Microsoft works with independent software vendor (ISV) partners to localize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through localization apps that we make available on [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For those regions, localizations can be available through preferred localization app program. Preferred localization apps program recognizes those apps, which are built according to Microsoft quality guidelines. ISV partners who comply with those program requirements and guidelines can benefit technically and commercially to serve their resellers and customers.  

In the following sections, you can find requirements and guidelines. You can reach out to the program team if you want to participate in this program and comply with the below requirements by contacting us through [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Validated Localization apps initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot program. The following requirements and benefits can change based upon the partner and customer feedback.  

Apps in the Validated Localization pilot program contain a set of functionalities addressing local regulatory requirements that fall within one of the categories in the following list.  

- **Regulatory requirements** - local functionality that helps businesses fulfill their legal requirements, such as tax reporting, local E-invoicing formats, local GAAP, and other regulatory requirements.
- **National standards requirement** – local functionality that addresses local standards, such as address formats, national banking formats, or local interpretations of global standards.
- **Local language** - local language in the localization app, but also for a base app if this language isn't currently on the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Local market needs or industry requirements should not be included in the preferred localization apps. If apps contain these functionalities, the apps can't be approved as Validated Localization apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Local functionality is beneficial to the productivity business processes in a country and thereby adds value to a business but isn't required from a regulatory perspective, such as specific banking and payment formats, expense reports, HR features, and payroll. Similar smaller or bigger, and nice-to-have features should be isolated into other apps. If apps contain these functionalities, they aren't approved as Validated Localization apps.

## Validated Localization app business requirements  

- The Validated Localization App provider complies with all requirements to be a CSP indirect provider.  
- The Validated Localization App provider brings to market a minimum of offerings across five countries/regions, which bundle Dynamics 365 Business Central with a Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider has a minimum of 10 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers with production environments, which are actively using the Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider submits a business plan on a yearly basis to the program v-team. The plan includes planned marketing and readiness activities to promote the bundled offering with the CSP Indirect Resellers in applicable countries/regions. Plan can be submitted at the start of each quarter to [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).  
- The Validated Localization Apps are available to all customers and partners who want to benefit from them.
- The Validated Localization App provider engages in recurring workstreams with Microsoft.
- The Validated Localization App provider must maintain its status as an Embedded Localization Partner.  
- The Validated Localization App provider agrees to continuously adhere to the business, functional, and technical requirements outlined on this page.

## Validated Localization app functional and technical requirements  

### Functionality requirements

In addition to the technical requirements for the preferred localization app, the minimum viable product scope for preferred localization app is:  

- Local Regulatory Features:  
  - Legal requirements.
  - Officially mandatory features.
  - Horizontal only features (not industry-specific).  
  - Applicable in most businesses.  
  - Within the following blueprint:
    - Areas of the most frequent legislative changes.
    - Already tracked as a localization in Microsoft localizations.
    - Feature references – seldom new.  
    - No vendor or bank specific formats, payroll, or similar.
    - No global features not built by Microsoft.
- Translations:
  - Translation of a localization app to local languages.
  - Translation of a base app to local languages if the language isn't already [supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  
  - Translation of the localization app's documentation to local languages.
- Even though they're both part of localization, we recommended that National Standard Features (local part) are built as separate apps from Local Regulatory Features.
- Demo data in the local language for the specific market.
- All features must be designed with a basic user interface. They're intended primarily for the SMB market.  
- Avoid building new features if the same or similar functionality is already in the base app. For example, electronic invoicing, audit exports, VAT features, data exchange, and others. Most of the functionality is common to all countries/regions, but there are local rules or business formats that are extensions of global frameworks or formats. Instead of building new features, extend existing ones.  
- Prepare setup guides (wizards) for areas that are complex to set up to help users enable, discover, and have good first experience using your localization app.  
- Partners must provide functional documentation for all aspects of their localization.  

### Technical requirements  

The following are requirements that you must meet before submitting the Validated Localization app as an extension for validation. This list doesn’t change the [technical validation list](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission) and only extends requirements from there.  

- Providers must build the Validated Localization app based on the W1 base app.  
- Providers must follow Microsoft lifecycle and support policies.   
- Mandatory test automation must cover a minimum 80% of code and all business processes that change with the Validated Localization app must be covered by test automation.  
- Providers must update and/or test its Validated Localization app before the official launch of new release (minimum with the RC before new release) to confirm there are no issues. 
- All objects in the Validated Localization app code must be in English.   
- The Validated Localization app providers must follow Microsoft policy for obsolete objects and breaking changes and best practices for deprecation of the AL Code.  
- The Validated Localization app providers should add new events if required by the market (other implementation partners or customers) if it makes reasonable business sense. The events must follow Microsoft policy and practice. Otherwise, the validated localization app providers must provide a response to justify why it doesn't make reasonable business sense to add them.
- The Validated Localization app providers must provide written test scenarios in English and enable Microsoft to do manual testing if required by Microsoft.  
- If a Validated Localization app extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data model with new tables and/or fields, the Validated Localization app provider must set the **DataClassification** property correctly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create an integration if you find it beneficial to have some functionality placed outside the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and instead connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using for example, APIs or web services.

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Correct or cancel unpaid sales invoices

You can correct or cancel an unpaid posted sales invoice, provided that it hasn't been fully shipped. This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change before the shipment is complete. In all other scenarios, we recommend that you create a corrective sales credit memo directly. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).  

> [!NOTE]  
> After a posted sales invoice has been partially or fully paid, you cannot correct or cancel it from the posted sales invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a sales credit memo to void the sale and reimburse the customer, optionally managed with a sales return order. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

The difference between canceling or correcting a posted sales invoice that isn't paid or shipped is described in the following table.

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cancel** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
| **Correct** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A new sales invoice with the same information is created, unless the posted sales order was posted from a sales order. In that case, we suggest you cancel the posted sales invoice instead and then make the correction and continue the sales process from the original sales order. <br/><br/>The new sales invoice has a different number than the initial sales invoice. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
|**Create Corrective Credit Memo**|A new sales credit memo is created with the same information. You can adjust the new sales credit memo before posting, and it will be applied to the original invoice when you post it. |

When you correct or cancel a posted sales invoice, the corrective sales credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial sales invoice was posted. This reverses the posted sales invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted sales credit memo for your audit trail.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well. For more information, see [Correct Prepayments](finance-how-to-correct-prepayments.md).

## To cancel a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted sales invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Cancel** action.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating sales order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Qty. Invoiced** fields on the related sales order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

## To correct a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to correct.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, you can't correct the posted sales invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Correct** action.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the sales invoice was posted from a sales order, we recommend that you *cancel* this sales invoice and then process the correction from the original sales order. If the original sales order has been deleted, such as if it has been fully shipped, you can create a new sales order by using the **Copy Document** action. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-by-copying-a-posted-sales-invoice).
4. A new sales invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice.
5. Choose the **Show Corrective Credit Memo** action to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

# Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and see what is happening on the back end. By integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can give your sales people that insight. The integration lets people view information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. For more information, see [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the process of integrating the online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For information about on-premises configuration, see [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

## Integrate through Dataverse

To make it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you're integrating for the first time, you must do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## Integration settings that are specific to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration

Integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] happens through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and many standard settings and tables are provided. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following sections list those settings.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in Sales

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed, you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. The following security roles are deployed:

* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> * You must have Read permissions for the Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_connection) table.
> * You must have Read, Write, and Delete permissions for the Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Connection settings in the setup guide

You can use an assisted setup guide to quickly set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as coupling between records.

1. Choose **Setup and Extensions**, and then choose **Assisted Setup**.
2. Choose **Set up the Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Optionally, there are advanced settings that can enhance security and enable more capabilities. The following table describes the advanced settings.  

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **Import Dynamics 365 Sales Solution** | Install and configure the integration solution in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. |
|**Automatically Synchronize Item Availability**|Specifies that the item availability job queue must be scheduled. The job queue runs every 30 minutes, and updates the availability of the coupled items.|
| **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** | When people create sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and fulfill orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this setting integrates the process in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Enable sales order processing integration](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/sales-enterprise/developer/enable-sales-order-processing-integration).<br><br>**Note:** You can't use this option if you use the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option. The two settings are mutually exclusive. To learn more about this option, go to [Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders](#single-and-bi-directional-synchronization-of-sales-orders). |
|**Enable Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** | Enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. |
| **Dynamics 365 SDK Version** | This is relevant only if you're integrating with an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. This SDK is the Dynamics 365 software development kit (also referred to as Xrm) you use to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The version must be compatible with the SDK version that is used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and equal to or newer than the version used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. |
|**Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders**|Synchronize sales orders in both directions. To learn more about this option, go [Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders](#single-and-bi-directional-synchronization-of-sales-orders).<br><br>**Note:** You can't use this option if you use the **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option. The two settings are mutually exclusive.|

> [!TIP]
> If you also want to integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service, the guide provides an optional step that can help. To learn more about integrating with Field Service, go to [Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service](admin-integrate-field-service.md).

### Connection settings on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup page

Enter the following information for the connection from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
|**Dynamics 365 Sales URL**|The URL of your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] instance. This setting lets users open the records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, an account or product. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records open in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|**Automatically Synchronize Item Availability**|Specifies that the item availability job queue must be scheduled. The job queue runs every 30 minutes, and updates the availability of the coupled items.|
|**Dynamics 365 SDK Version**|If you're integrating with an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], use the Dynamics 365 software development kit (also referred to as Xrm) to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The version that you select must be compatible with the SDK version that is used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. This version equal to or newer than the version used by [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

In addition to these settings, enter the following settings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **Sales Order Integration is Enabled** | Enable users to submit sales orders and activated quotes in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and then view and process them in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This setting integrates the process in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Enable sales order processing integration](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/sales-enterprise/developer/enable-sales-order-processing-integration). |
| **Automatically Create Sales Orders** | Create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when a user creates and submits one in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. |
| **Automatically Process Sales Quotes** | Process a sales quote in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when a user creates and activates one in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Handling Sales Quotes Data](/dynamics365/business-central/marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm?tabs=new-experience#handling-sales-quotes-data). |
|**Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders**|Synchronize sales orders in both directions. To learn more about this option, go to [Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders](#single-and-bi-directional-synchronization-of-sales-orders).|
<!--
### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through Dataverse requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
### Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders

When you set up your integration, there are options that control the direction in which you synchronize sales orders, and how you submit them.

The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option lets you synchronize sales orders from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. For example, if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can archive the sales document and create a new document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same is true for changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when prices, tax amounts, or expected shipment dates change, the changes synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Bidirectional synchronization helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of sales orders.

For bidirectional synchronization, you make sales orders available for synchronization when you change their status to **Submitted** in Sales. When you set that status, you can no longer change information on the order's lines. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**. If there's a mistake, you can revert the order to **Open** (in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) or **Active** (in Sales), and then add or delete lines to correct the mistake, and submit the order again.

> [!TIP]
> When you enable the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a record on the **Sales Order Archives** page when you post or change information on an order. For example, the archived versions can be useful for exploring an order's history.

The **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option synchronizes only from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For this option, you use the **Submit** action in Sales to make orders available for synchronization. When you do, you can no longer change any information on the order. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**.

To use this option, you must provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, see [Handle Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** and **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** options are mutually exclusive. You can't use both options at the same time.

For both options, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows all sales orders with the **Submitted** status on the **Orders - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** page.

### Standard Sales entity mapping for synchronization

Entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as sales orders. To work with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |

> [!NOTE]
> The mappings for the Item Unit of Measure, Resource Unit of Measure, and Unit Group tables are available only if your administrator has turned on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Items and Resources with Products in Different Units of Measure](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronize-items-and-resources-with-products-with-different-units-of-measure).

## Synchronize items and resources with products with different units of measure

Businesses often produce or purchase the items in one unit of measure, and then sell them in another. To synchronize items that use multiple units of measure, you must turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. 

When you turn on the feature update, a new Unit Group table is created and assigned to each item and resource in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tables let you map the Unit Group, Item Unit of Measure, and Resource Unit of Measure tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the Dynamics 365 Sales Unit Group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following image shows the mappings.

:::image type="content" source="media/unit group 1.png" alt-text="Table mappings for unit groups":::

You can create multiple units of measure for each unit group, and assign the groups to products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize the products with items and resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually couple item units of measure or resource units of measure with a unit group. When you do, if the unit group for the item or resource isn't coupled to a unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example, because the unit group didn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

### Map items and resources to products

When you turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, the following happens:

* New mappings are created for items and resources.
* Existing mappings are deleted. <!--which mappings?-->
* A data upgrade creates unit groups for items and resources.

To use the new mappings, you must synchronize unit groups, item unit of measure, and resource unit of measures. You must also resynchronize items and resources. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] does not allow you to change a unit group for a product. Therefore, you must retire your products and uncouple the items and resources, and then synchronize by creating new products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. 

The following steps describe the steps to start mapping unit groups:

1. Be sure that products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] aren't coupled with items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they are, go to the **Items** and/or **Resources** pages and use the filter options to select the coupled records. Then choose the **Dynamics 365 Sales** action, and select **Uncouple**. This action schedules a background job to uncouple the records. While the job is running, you can check its status by using the **Synchronization Log** action. For more information, see [Coupling and Synchronizing](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md). 
2. Because new products are created in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with new unit groups, to avoid duplicate names, do one of the following steps:

  * Rename your products, and then retire them in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Retire products (Sales Hub)](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/retire-product). To bulk edit your products in Microsoft Excel, sign in to Power Apps, choose your environment, go to the **Product** table, and then choose the **Data** tab. Clear any filters that are applied. In the **Data** group, choose the **Edit Data in Excel** action. Add a prefix or suffix to the coupled products, and then retire them.
    * Retire your products and delete them. 

3. Follow these steps to synchronize **Unit Groups**, **Unit of Measures**, **Items**, and **Resources**:
    1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page.
    2. Use the **Run Full Synchronization** action to open the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.
    3. For the **ITEM UOM**, **RESOURCE UOM**, AND **UNIT GROUP** mappings, choose the **Recommend Full Synchronization** action.
    4. Choose the **Sync All** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For mappings that have not yet been fully synchronized, this action will fully synchronize them. To prevent those mappings from synchronizing, delete the mappings from the page. This only removes them from the current full synchronization, and does not delete the mappings.
    
5. Choose the **ITEM-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the items in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the item.
6. Choose the **RESOURCE-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the resources in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the resources.

### Synchronization rules

The following table lists the rules that control the synchronization between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These rules are in addition to rules defined for Dataverse, which also apply. For more information, see [Standard Entity Mapping](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to data in  that were made by the integration user account are not synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you do not change data while using that account. For more information, see [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

|Table|Rule|
|-----|----|
|Units of Measure|Units of measure are synchronized with unit groups in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. There can only be one unit of measure defined in the unit group.|
|Items|When it synchronizes items with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a price list in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To avoid synchronization errors, you shouldn't modify this price list manually.|
|Resources|Resources are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products that have product type Service.|
|Customer Price Groups|Customer price groups are synchronized with Sales price lists.|
|Sales Prices|Sales prices that have sales type Customer Price Group and have a sales code defined are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] price list lines|
|Opportunities|Opportunities are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] opportunities. The Salesperson Code value defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|Posted Sales Invoices|Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it's better to synchronize all other tables that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled table in Sales.|
|Sales Orders|When you enable sales order integration, when you release sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that were created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] they synchronize with sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all tables involved with the order. For example, sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

### Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration

The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. There are more jobs available from Dataverse. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](./admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. UNITOFMEASURE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
2. RESOURCE-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
3. ITEM-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job

## Connect to on-premises versions of Business Central 2019 release wave 1 and Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

The Microsoft Power Platform team [announced](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse) that it's deprecating the Office 365 authentication type. If you're using a version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises that's earlier than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 1, you must use the OAuth authentication type to connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] online. The steps in this section describe how to connect the following product versions:

* Business Central 2019 release wave 1
* Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

### Prerequisites

* You must have a Microsoft Azure subscription. A trial account works for application registration.
* [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is configured to use one of the following authentication types:

   * Office 365 (legacy)

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Effective April 2022, Office365 (legacy) will no longer be supported. For more information, see [Important changes (deprecations) coming in Power Apps, Power Automate and customer engagement apps](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse).

   * OAuth

### Connect Business Central 2019 release wave 1 and Dynamics NAV 2018

1. Import the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Solution into your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment. The integration solution is available in the CrmCustomization folder on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Dynamics NAV 2018 installation DVD. Depending on your product version, import one of the following solutions:

   * For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the folder contains the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v9 and DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v91. solutions. The solution you should import depends on the version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] you're connecting to. [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] online requires the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v91 integration solution.
   * For Dynamics NAV 2018, install the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution solution.

2. Create a non-interactive integration user in your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment, and assign the user the following security roles. For more information, see [Create a non-interactive user account](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-non-interactive-user-account).

   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

   > [!Important]
   > This user must not have the System Administrator security role. Also, you cannot use the system administrator account as the integration user.

3. In the Azure portal, create an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory). 
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you register the app in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment so that you do not have to consent to letting the app access the environment. If you register the app in another environment, you must sign in to Microsoft Entra ID using the administrator account for your Dataverse environment and give consent.
   >
   > Additionally, the app that you register must not have a secret. Connecting an app with a secret to Dataverse is available only in Business Central 2020 release wave 1 and later.
  
4. Depending on your product version, do one of the following steps:

    * In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
    * In Dynamics NAV 2018, search for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

5. In the **Authentication Type** field, choose the option for OAuth. 
6. Choose the CRM SDK version that matches solution version you imported in step 1.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This step is only relevant for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

7. Enter the URL of your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment, and then enter the user name and password for the integration user. 

   * In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Server Address** field.
   * In Dynamics NAV 2018, use the **Dynamics 365 Sales URL** field.

8. In the **Connection String** field, specify the ID of the app registration. This field has two tokens in which the ID of your application should be specified.

   |Token           |Description  |
   |----------------|-------------|
   |**AppId**       |Set to the application ID.      |
   |**RedirectUri** |Set to the application ID, but add the **app://** prefix.         |

    **Example**
    The following example shows a connection string.

    ```
    AuthType=OAuth;Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com;Password=****;Url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;AppId=<your AppId>;RedirectUri=app://<your AppId>;TokenCacheStorePath=;LoginPrompt=Auto
    ```
9. Enable the connection.

> [!Note]
> If you want to configure a connection to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] instance with a specific authentication type, fill in the fields on the **Authentication Type Details** FastTab. For more information, see [Authentication with Microsoft Dataverse web services](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/authentication). This step is not required when connecting an online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

# Import business data from other finance systems

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload your own data and to test your new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. Depending on the finance solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.  

From the Role Center, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can migrate data from QuickBooks because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to migrate data from other finance solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes templates for accounts, customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you import your data. To import item pictures, you can use a dedicated function on the **Inventory Setup** page. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you use data migration wizards to import data from Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, or QuickBooks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content, or [QuickBooks Data Migration](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md).

## Work with Data in Excel

You can use the Excel add-in to prepare existing content for use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

## Import Data from Configuration Packages

For larger implementation work, you can set up solution-specific configuration packages. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Working with configuration packages is advanced functionality, and we recommend that you contact your reselling partner. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only).

You can import master data and some transactional data from other finance systems based on the default configuration package in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Configuration Packages** page, you can work with the package to import and validate the data before you apply the package. For example, you can export the configuration package to Excel and set up your data there. Then, you can import the data from Excel again. The package consists of 27 tables, including master data such as customers, vendors, items, and accounts, other basic setup tables such as shipping methods, and transactions tables such as sales header and lines.  

When you export the default configuration package to Excel, the generated workbook contains a worksheet for each table in the package. To simplify your tasks, you can take advantage of the XML manipulation tools that are built into Excel. You can also use Excel built-in functions to help with data formatting and to put data in the correct cell. For example, add a blank worksheet and copy the legacy data to it. Then make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data. After you have mapped all of the data, copy the range of data onto the table worksheet.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not change the columns in the worksheets. If they are moved, changed, or deleted, the worksheet cannot be imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Fields of type Blob cannot be exported/imported using Excel.

### Tables in the Default Configuration Package

The default configuration package supports the following tables:

- Payment Terms
- Customer Price Group
- Shipment Method
- Salesperson/Purchaser
- Location
- GL Account
- Customer
- Vendor
- Item
- Sales Header
- Sales Line
- Purchase Header
- Purchase Line
- Gen. Journal Line
- Item Journal Line
- Customer Posting Group
- Vendor Posting Group
- Inventory Posting Group
- Unit of Measure
- Gen. Business Posting Group
- Gen. Product Posting Group
- General Posting Setup
- Territory
- Item Category
- Sales Price
- Purchase Price

# Flows for production, assembly, and projects

Internal flows, such as picking components and putting away end items for assembly, projects, and production orders are similar to inbound or outbound flows. Many of the processes might seem familiar. This article provides information about how to work with internal warehouse flows with various levels of complexity.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important that the options you choose improve your processes without causing overhead. The following tables describe typical configurations for dealing with physical goods for production, projects, and assembly orders.

### Inbound flow (put-away)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Inbound Flow of Production Order|Inbound Flow of Assembly Order|Inbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Output Journal</br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post output using **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|  
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Production Output Whse Handling: Inventory Put-away. </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can still post output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings. |Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order -> Inventory Put-away|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Consolidated put-away activities for multiple source documents.|No dedicated settings|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order(s) -> Output Journal|Assembly order(s) ->  internal movements | Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Same as above plus directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above|Same as above| Put-away isn't applicable for projects|

Some configurations don't let you use dedicated warehouse documents to register put-aways. However, if your location uses bins you can use generic movement documents to move produced or assembled items to warehouse. Learn more at [Moving Items](warehouse-move-items.md).

### Outbound flow (pick)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Outbound Flow of Production Order|Outbound Flow of Assembly Order|Outbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Consumption Journal </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post consumption using a **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Project -> Project Journal|  
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Production, Assembly, Projects: Inventory Pick, Inventory Movement </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can still post consumption directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings.|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order -> Inventory Pick|Assembly Order -> Inventory movement</br><br/>The **Inventory Movement** can be used only with bins.|Project -> Inventory Pick|
|Advanced|Consolidated pick activities for multiple source documents.|Production, Assembly, Projects: Warehouse Pick|Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Production Order(s) -> Warehouse Pick -> Consumption Journal |Assembly order(s) -> Warehouse Pick| Project(s) -> Warehouse Pick -> Project Journal |
|Advanced|Same as above + Directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above|Same as above| Same as above|

## Warehouses without dedicated warehouse activity

Even if you don't use dedicated warehouse activities, you might want to track things like consumption and production output. The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents.

* [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
* [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
* [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Basic warehouse configuration

### Flows to and from production in a basic warehouse configuration  

The inbound and outbound flows in a basic warehouse configuration involve the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the inbound flow (put-away), in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick/Movement**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick production components in the flow to production. To put away the products you produce, use **Inventory Put-away** documents.

For locations that use bins, inventory movement documents are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from To-Production or Open Shop Floor bins, go to [Flushing production components in the warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Inventory movements are important documents if you're using **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods. Learn more at [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

* The **To-Production Bin Code**, **From-Production Bin Code**, and **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** fields on the location or the machine/work center define the default flows to and from production areas.
* Manage the movement of produced items on the **Internal Movement** page without a relation to a production order.

### Flows to and from assembly in a basic warehouse configuration  

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Movement**.

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to pick assembly components in the flow to assembly. Post assembly output and consumption directly from an assembly order.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Pick** and **Inventory Put-away** documents aren't supported for assembly orders.

For locations that use bins:

* Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.
* The **To-Assembly Bin Code**, **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card define default flows to and from assembly areas.
* Manage the movement of assembled items on the **Internal Movement** page, without a relation to an assembly order.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order assembly flows. Learn more at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#understanding-assemble-to-order-and-assemble-to-stock). In relation to warehouse management, assemble-to-stock is part of the internal warehouse flow, and assemble-to-order is in the outbound warehouse flow. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Flows for project management in a basic warehouse configuration

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For a location that uses bins, the **To-Project Bin Code** field on the location defines the default flows to project management.

## Advanced warehouse configurations  

### Flows to and from production in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

Use the **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components for production.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warehouse Put-away** documents aren't supported for production output.

For locations that use bins:

* **Warehouse Movement** documents and the **Movement Worksheet** page are especially useful for component flushing. Learn more at [Flushing production components in the warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md#flushing-production-components-in-an-advanced-warehouse-configuration).
* The **To-Production Bin Code**, **From-Production Bin Code**, and **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** fields on the location or machine/work center define the default flows to and from production areas. 
* Manage the movement of produced items on the **Movement Worksheet** or **Whse. Internal Put-away** pages, without a relation to a production order.

### Flows to and from assembly in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**. 

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components for assembly.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warehouse Put-away** document isn't supported for assembly orders.

For locations that use bins:

* The **To-Assembly Bin Code** and **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location define the default flows to and from assembly areas.
* Manage the movement of assembly items on the **Movement Worksheet** or **Whse. Internal Put-away** pages, without a relation to an assembly order.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order assembly flows. Learn more at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#understanding-assemble-to-order-and-assemble-to-stock). 

Assemble-to-stock is part of the internal warehouse flow, and assemble-to-order is in the outbound warehouse flow. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).

### Flows to project management in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components in the flow to project management.

For locations that use bins, the **To-Projects Bin Code** field on the location defines the default flows to the project area.

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# Design details: Non-deductible VAT

Non-deductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser, but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, you must contact the local tax authorities in your country or region to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible. Even when you know that a specific percentage of the VAT isn't deductible, there are different models for handling non-deductible amounts as they are related to **items** and **fixed assets**.

## Prerequisites for using non-deductible VAT

To use and post non-deductible VAT, follow these steps.

1. On the **VAT Setup** page, select **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to enable the feature.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select which VAT posting groups can use non-deductible VAT.

## Examples

For the following examples, non-deductible VAT is enabled, and the following setup is completed:

- The **VAT Product Posting Group** field is set to **NDVAT**.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup** page:

    - **NDVAT** is set as the VAT product posting group, and **DOMESTIC** is set as the VAT business posting group.
    - The **VAT Identifier** value must be unique.
    - The **VAT %** field is set to **25**.
    - The **Allow Non-deductible VAT** field is set to **Allow**.
    - The **Non-deductible VAT %** field is set to **100**.
    - The **VAT Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**.
    - Only the sales VAT account and purchase VAT account are configured.

All the examples use items and fixed assets where the VAT product posting group is **NDVAT**.

### Items

A new item has **NDVAT** set as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Value Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Item Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Item Cost isn't enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,000.00 | 1 |

#### Use for Item Cost is enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,250.00 | 1 |

### Fixed assets

A new fixed asset has the acquisition cost account set to use **NDVAT** as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Fixed Asset Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost isn't enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost is enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 250.00 | 0.00 |

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

Use the following procedure to update an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** page. The steps are similar to those for updating the **Analysis View Card** and **Analysis View List** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
4. Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
5. On the **Analysis Views** page, select the analysis view, then choose the **Update** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Update on Posting** checkbox on an analysis view card, the view automatically updates when someone posts an associated transaction.

> [!NOTE]  
> To update some or all analysis views at the same time, use the **Update Analysis Views** batch job.

# Set up resources for projects

To correctly manage resource activities, you must set up your resources and the related costs and prices. The project-related prices, discounts, and cost factor rules are set up on the project card. You can specify the costs and prices for individual resources, resource groups, or all available resources of the company.

You specify the default amount per hour when you set up a resource. The price and cost amounts apply when you use or sell resources in a project. For example, if you use a specific machine for five hours, the calculation is based on the amount per hour.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't purchase external resources for a specific project. We recommend that you use items of the type Service instead.

## To set up a resource

Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up a resource group

You can combine several resources in one resource group. All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources. You can also enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set capacity for a resource

To calculate how much time a resource can spend on projects, you must set their capacity. Capacity represents a resource's available time for a period on the work calendar. This setup is used when you fill in project planning lines that contain the resource. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant resource card, and then choose the **Resource Capacity** action.
3. On the **Resource Capacity** page, in the **View By** field, specify the length of the period, such as **Day**, that is shown on columns on the **Resource Capacity Matrix** FastTab.
4. For each resource on a line, specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available.
5. Alternatively, to detail the resource's capacity for a specific period, choose the **Set Capacity** action.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're setting capacity for a group of people who typically work the same hours, you can save a little time and ensure consistency by choosing a work hour template. For example, you might have one work hour template for full time technicians, and another for technicians that work part time. To learn more about work hour templates, go to [To set up work hour templates](service-how-setup-work-service-hours.md#to-set-up-work-hour-templates).

6. On the **Resource Capacity Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
7. Choose the **Update Capacity** action. The **Resource Capacity** page is updated with the entered capacity.
8. Close the page.

## To set up alternate resource costs

In addition to the cost specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate costs for each resource. For example, if you pay an employee a higher hourly rate for overtime, you can set up a resource cost for the overtime rate. The alternate cost that you set up for the resource overrides the cost on the resource card when you use the resource in the resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate costs for, and then choose the **Costs** action.  
3. On the **Resource Costs** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.  
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up resource costs that apply to all resources and resource groups, open the **Resource Costs** page and fill in the fields.

## To set up alternate resource prices

In addition to price specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate prices for each resource. These alternate prices can be conditional. They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific project or work type.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate prices for, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. On the **Resource Prices** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up.

## To adjust resource prices

If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job doesn't create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment takes effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on existing alternate prices

If you already set up alternate resource prices for some resources, you can use a batch job to set up multiple alternate resource prices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Price)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, the **Resource Price Changes** page shows the results of the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on standard prices

If you want to set up multiple alternate resource prices based on the standard prices on the resource cards, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Res.)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, open the **Resource Price Changes** page to see the results of the batch job.

### Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for resources at the same time, enable the **Enable multiple users to post resource ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Set Up Service Contracts
Before you can work with contracts, you must set up the following: 

* **Service contract groups**, which gather service contracts that are related in some way.
* **Service contract account groups**, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for service invoices created for service contracts. You assign these groups to service contracts.  
* **Contract templates** that define contract layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. When you create a contract quote, the fields automatically contain the contents of the template fields.
* **Customer templates** that let you create quotes for contacts or potential customers who are not registered as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## To set up a service contract group  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Disc. on Contr. Orders Only** check box if you want contract or service discounts to be valid only for contract service orders, such as maintenance.

# Creating cost budgets

Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  

A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base. For more information, see [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

You use the following pages to create and analyze cost budgets. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to find a page, and then read the tooltip for each.

# Dispose of or retire fixed assets

When you sell or otherwise dispose of a fixed asset, you must post the disposal value to calculate and record the gain or loss. A disposal entry must be the last entry posted for a fixed asset. For partially disposed fixed assets, you can post more than one disposal entry. The total of all posted disposal amounts must be a credit amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you trade-in a fixed asset for another one, you must record both the sale of the old asset (disposal) and the purchase of the new one (acquisition). For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

The following steps assume that your posting groups are set up on the **FA Posting Groups** page. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  

## To post a disposal from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Disposal**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for disposal posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Disposal Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Disposal Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

If you sell or dispose of part of a fixed asset, you must split up the asset before you can record the disposal transaction. For more information, see [Transfer, Split, or Combine Fixed Assets](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md).  

## To view disposal ledger entries

When you sell or dispose of a fixed asset, the disposal value is posted to the general ledger where you can view the result.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.  
3. Select the depreciation book that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
4. Select a line with **Disposal** in the **FA Posting Category** field, and then choose the **Find Entries** action.  
5. On the **Find Entries** page, select the general ledger entry line, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.  

The **General Ledger Entries** page opens where you can see the entries that the disposal posting resulted in.

# Troubleshoot Copilot and agent capabilities

Copilot is an AI-powered functionality in Business Central that assists in various tasks like drafting marketing text and reconciling bank accounts. If you're experiencing trouble with Copilot or other agent capabilities, this article can help you identify and fix common issues.

## Copilot doesn't appear on pages

If Copilot functionality, such as the **Draft with Copilot** action for marketing text suggestions or the **Reconcile with Copilot** action for bank account reconciliation assist, doesn't appear on a page as expected, check the following:

- Make sure that the feature is enabled if it's controlled under Feature Management. [Learn more about feature management](admin-feature-management.md).

- Make sure that the functionality isn't hidden by personalization. [Learn more about personalization](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Copilot appears on pages, but you get an error that it's not activated

When you try to use Copilot and you get an error similar to **Sorry, Copilot is not activated for \[feature\]**, there are a couple things to check:

- First, make sure that the feature is activated on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about activating Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features). 
- Next, make sure that privacy notice statement for Azure OpenAI integration isn't set to **Disagree for everyone**. If it is, change it to **Agree for everyone**. [Learn more about privacy notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Copilot capabilities from Microsoft not listed on Copilot & agent capabilities page

If none of the AI features from Microsoft are shown in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, it's likely because you have one or more embed apps installed on your environment. Embed apps can offer their own Copilot capabilities, but capabilities published by Microsoft aren't compatible with environments having embed apps.

# Planning

The production operations required to transform inputs into finished goods must be planned daily or weekly depending on the volume and nature of the products. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to supply for anticipated and actual demand from sale, assembly, and production as well as features for distribution planning using stockkeeping units and location transfers.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic mainly describes planning for companies involved in manufacturing or assembly management where the resulting supply orders can be either production, assembly, transfer, or purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Planning Worksheet** page.
>
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports supply planning for wholesale companies where the resulting supply orders can only be transfer and purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Requisition Worksheet** page, which is described indirectly in this topic as most planning functionality applies to both worksheets.

Planning can be seen as the preparation of required supply orders in the purchasing, assembly, or manufacturing departments to fulfill sales or end-item demand. For more information, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md), [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md), and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

# Add extended text

Use extended texts to communicate additional information for items, stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources. For example, the extra details might be about special prices, terms, or handling instructions. Provide the information by adding extra lines as extended text. You can also set up conditions for use of the extra lines.  

The following section describes how to add extended text to a description of an item. The same steps apply to stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources.  

## To define extended text for a description

1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field, or turn on the **All Language Codes** toggle if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Text** field, enter the extended text.
7. On the **Sales**, **Purchases**, and **Service** FastTabs, turn on the toggles for the documents you want to include the extended text.
8. Close the page.

You can now add this extended text to documents. The following procedure explains how to add extended text to a sales order, but the same steps apply to any other document that you specified for the extended text.  

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line

1. Open a sales order that has a sales line for an item with extended text. To learn more, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

* Assemble to order  
* Assemble to stock  

## Assemble to order

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. For example, for the following reasons:

* You'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* You want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

The following list describes some of the benefits of the assemble-to-order process:  

* Customize assembly items when taking a sales order.  
* Overview availability of the assembly item and its components.  
* Reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment.  
* Determine the profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost.  
* Integrated with the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier.  
* Assemble to order when you create a sales quote or a blanket sales order.  
* Combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities.  

In the assemble-to-order process, you assemble items for a sales order. There's a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order.  

When you enter an assemble-to-order item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created. The assembly order is based on the sales line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly BOM. The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. The delivery date is based on the availability of components. To learn more about assembling items for sales orders, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can sell inventory quantities and assemble-to-order quantities on the same sales order. To learn more about combining stock and assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-order, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Order**.  

## Assemble to stock

Use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. Assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. You can also consume these items as subassembly components. The items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. To learn more about assembly items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

When you specify an assemble-to-stock item on a sales line, the item is treated like any other item sold from inventory. For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks availability only for the assembled item only, and not its components.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can assemble an item to order even if the item is set up to be assembled to stock. Learn more at [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-stock, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Stock**.  

## Combination scenarios

When assemble-to-order and inventory quantities are combined on a sales order, assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped first.  

If an assembly order is linked to a sales order line, the value in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field via the **Quantity** field on the assembly order. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is related to the **Qty. to Ship** field on the sales order line. This relation manages how you ship partial and complete assemble-to-order quantities:

* When the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order
* In combination scenarios where part of the quantity is assembled to order and part is shipped from inventory.

The combination scenario allows flexibility for partial shipments. You can use the **Quantity to Assemble** field to specify the quantity to ship partially from inventory and by assembling to order.  

If the full sales line quantity must be assembled to order and shipped, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the linked assembly order when you change the quantity to ship. This update ensures that the quantity being shipped is fully supplied by the assemble-to-order quantity.  

However, in combination scenarios, the full value in the **Qty. to Ship** is not copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the assembly order. Instead, a default value is inserted in the **Quantity to Assemble** field. The value is calculated from the **Qty. to Ship** field to ensure the assemble-to-order quantities ship first.

To deviate from the default, for example because you only want to assemble more or less of the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field within predefined rules, as illustrated below.  

An example of why you would modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post the shipment of inventory quantities before you ship the assembly output.  

The following tables explain the rules that define the minimum and maximum values that you can enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field to deviate from the default value in a combination scenario. The table shows a combination scenario where the **Qty. to Ship** field on the linked sales order line is changed from 7 to 4, and the **Quantity to Assemble** is therefore defaulted to 4.  

**Sales Order Line**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 10          | 7                | 7                             | 0                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4                |                               |                      |

**Assembly Order Header**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 7           | 7                | 0                             | 7                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4 (inserted by default)|                         |                      |

Based on this example, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field as follows:  

* The minimum quantity you can enter is 1. You must assemble at least one unit to be able to sell the four units, assuming that the remaining three are available in inventory.  
* The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4. This limit ensures that you don't assemble more of the item than you need for the sale.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Design

Item tracking in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] started with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The item tracking functionality is in a separate object structure with intricate links to posted documents and item ledger entries, and it is integrated with the reservation system, which handles reservation, order tracking, and action messaging. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md) in the Supply Planning design details.  

This design incorporates item tracking entries in total availability calculations throughout the system, including planning, manufacturing, and warehousing. Serial and lot numbers are applied on the item ledger entries to ensure simple access to historical data for item tracking purposes. With 2021 release wave 1, item tracking in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes package numbers.  

With the addition of serial, lot, and package numbers, the reservation system handles permanent item attributes while also handling intermittent links between supply and demand in the form of order tracking entries and reservation entries. Another different characteristic of serial or lot numbers compared to the conventional reservation data is the fact that they can be posted, either partially or fully. Therefore, the **Reservation Entry** table (T337) now works with a related table, the **Tracking Specification** table (T336), which manages and displays summing across active and posted item tracking quantities. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  

The following diagram outlines the design of item tracking functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

![Example of item tracking flow.](media/design_details_item_tracking_design.png "Example of item tracking flow")  

The central posting object is redesigned to handle the unique subclassification of a document line in the form of serial or lot numbers, and special relation tables are added to create the one-to-many relations between posted documents and their split item ledger entries and value ledger entries.  

Codeunit 22, **Item Jnl. – Post Line**, now splits the posting according to the item tracking numbers that are specified on the document line. Each unique item tracking number on the line creates its own item ledger entry for the item. This means that the link from the posted document line to the associated item ledger entries is now a one-to-many relation. This relation is handled by the following item tracking relation tables.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Item Entry Relation** (T6507)|Relates shipped or received lines to item ledger entries|  
|**Value Entry Relation** (T6508)|Relates invoiced lines to value entries|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure](design-details-item-tracking-posting-structure.md).

# Reserve items

You can reserve items for sales orders, purchase orders, service orders, assembly orders, transfer orders, and production orders. You can also reserve items in inventory or inbound on open document or journal lines. You do this on the **Reservation** page.

Each line you open to reserve items on the **Reservation** page displays information about one type of line (sales, purchase, or journal) or inventory entry. The lines describe how many items are available to be reserved from each type of line or entry.

> [!TIP]
> Based on the quantities you’ve reserved in inventory, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a status on the documents so that you’re quickly aware of the next step. For example, to indicate that you can ship a sales order or start to work on a project, assembly, or production order. The status also helps reduce the risk of accidental partial shipments or hold-ups due to missing stock for production and assembly orders.
>
> The **Reserved from stock** field can help you understand whether you can ship or pick for a specific order or order line. For lines, the Reserved from stock field is available on FactBoxes. To access the information for the entire order, the field is on the **Statistics** page.

## Reserve items for sales

The following procedure describes how to reserve items from a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase, service, transfer, and assembly orders.
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the sales order.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action. The **Reservation** page opens.  
4. Select the line you want to reserve the items from.  
5. Choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Function**|**Description**|
    |------------------|---------------------|  
    |**Auto Reserve**|To automatically reserve items on the **Reservation** page.|  
    |**Reserve from Current Line**|To reserve the items from the document on the line you have selected.|  
    |**Cancel Reservation from Current Line**|To cancel reservation of the items in the document on the line you've selected.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If item tracking lines exist for the sales order, the reservation system will take you through special steps. Learn more in the [To reserve a specific serial or lot number](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md#reserve-a-specific-serial-or-lot-number) section.  

## Reserve an item for a production order line

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve parent items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Functions** group, choose the **Reserve** action.
5. On the **Reservation** page, select the Sales Line, Order Line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.

## Reserve items for production order components

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve component items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, then choose **Components**.  
5. Select the relevant component line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select a line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production component line is now reserved.

## Reserve items in bulk

Use the **Reservation Worksheet** page to reserve and allocate incoming goods in bulk. For example, bulk reservations can help ensure that quantities are available for your sales and production orders. You can have multiple batches for different purposes. For example, you might allocate production orders on a weekly basis but reserve daily for sales.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reservation Worksheet**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Demand** action. The **Get Demand to Reserve** page opens.
1. On the **Get Demand to Reserve** page, specify the kind of demand you want to reserve from available inventory.
1. Fill in the filters as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Optional: To allocate the items right away, choose the **Allocate** action.
1. On the **Allocation Policy** page, choose a policy for each step.

   |Allocation policy  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Basic (No Conflicts)     | Allocates stock to a demand if there are no conflicts and the demand can be fully covered. For example, you have sales order A with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If you have 20 in stock, both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, no stock is allocated. You must manually allocate the quantity.        |
   |Equally    | Distributes available stock to demand equally. For example, you have a sales order with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If your stock level is 20, then both demands will receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, then both demands will get 6.        |
   |By Customer Priority|Distribution based on the **Priority** field on the **Customer Card** page. In cases of low inventory quantities, Business Central supplies higher-priority customers first.|

6. To reserve all lines where **Accept** is turned on, choose the **Make reservation** action.
    
## Change a reservation

You can change an item reservation.

1. From the document line you made the reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action.
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, update the **Quantity** field on the line you want to change.
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **OK** button.

## Cancel a reservation

You can cancel an item reservation.

1. From the document line you want to cancel a reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action on the **Lines** FastTab.  
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, choose the **Cancel Reservation** action.  
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **Yes** button.  

## Reserve a specific serial or lot number

From outbound documents for item-tracked items, such as sales orders or production component lists, you can reserve specific serial or lot numbers. For example, reserving specific serial or lot numbers can be useful in the following situations:

* If you need production components from a specific lot to ensure consistency with earlier production batches.
* Because a customer has requested a specific serial number. 

Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

This practice is referred to as a specific reservation, because you reserve from the quantity of item X that belongs to lot X. In contrast, if you reserve only from quantities of item X, then it's simply a normal, non-specific, reservation. Learn more at [Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Create a sales order line for an item-tracked item.  
3. Assign serial and lot numbers to the sales order line. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).
4. On the sales order line, choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. Choose the **Yes** button to reserve specific serial or lot numbers.  
6. On the **Item Tracking List** page, select the serial and lot number combination you have assigned.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to open the **Reservation** page showing only supply with the specified item tracking number. If there are any non-specific reservations on any of the item tracking numbers you've specified for this line, you're informed of the quantity that has already been reserved.  
8. Choose either the **Auto Reserve** or the **Reserve from Current Line** action to create the reservation of the specific item tracking numbers.

# Work with Production Families

A production family is a group of individual items whose relationship is based on the similarity of their manufacturing processes. By forming production families, some items can be manufactured twice or more in one production, which will optimize material consumption.

In the **Quantity** field on the **Family** page, you enter the quantity that will be produced when the whole family has been manufactured once.

## Example

In punching processes, four pieces of the same item can be produced from one sheet and 10 pieces of another, different, item at the same time. The punching machine will punch all 14 pieces in one step.

Forming production families reduces the scrap quantity because what would normally be leftover scrap, when producing big pieces, will be used instead to produce small items.

## To set up a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Families**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To produce based on a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new production order. For more information, see [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. In the **Source Type** field, select **Family**.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the relevant production family.

# Sort, search, and filter data in lists, reports, or XMLports

A few mechanisms are available to help you scan, find, and limit the records in a list, a report, or an XMLport. They include operations like sorting, searching, and filtering. You can apply some or all of these operations simultaneously to quickly find or analyze your data.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For reports and XMLports, as for lists, you can set filters to delimit the data that is included. However, you can't sort or search.

> [!TIP]
> When you view your data as tiles, you can search and use filtering. However, the full set of powerful features for sorting, searching, and filtering is available only when you view the records as a list. To switch from the tile view to the list view, select the ![Show as list.](media/ui_show_as_list_icon.png "Show as list arrow left") button.

<!--
When you want to search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or product groups, you enter criteria. In search criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.
-->

## Sorting

Sorting makes it easy to get a quick overview of your data. For example, if you have many customers, you can sort them by **Customer No.**, **Currency Code**, or **Country Region Code** value to get the overview that you need.

To sort a list, follow one of these steps:

- Select the text of a column heading to switch between ascending and descending order.
- Select the dropdown arrow in the column heading, and then select either the **Ascending** action or the **Descending** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting isn't supported for images, binary large object (BLOB) fields, FlowFilters, and fields that don't belong to a table.

## Searching

At the top of each list page is a ![Search list.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** button that provides a quick and easy way to reduce the number of records in a list and show only those records that contain the data that you're interested in.

To search, select the **Search** button or the <kbd>F3</kbd> key on your keyboard. Then enter the text that you're looking for in the search field. The search text that you enter can include letters, numbers, and other symbols.

![Screenshot that shows the search field.](media/ui-search/search-list-box.png)

In general, search tries to match text across all fields. It doesn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters (in other words, it's case-insensitive). It also matches text that occurs anywhere in the field: at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

> [!NOTE]
> Search doesn't match values in images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, FlowFields, and other fields that aren't part of a table.

### Choose between modern search and legacy search

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

On the most common pages, such as **Customers**, **Contacts**, and **Items**, you can select the dropdown arrow in the search field and then select between two search options on the menu: **Use modern search** and **Use legacy search**.

![Screenshot that shows the Use modern search and Use legacy search options on the dropdown menu for a search field.](media/ui-search/search-modern-legacy-options.png)

*Legacy search* is the older search method. It's the only method that is available in Business Central 2024 release wave 1 and earlier. *Modern search* is a newer, faster, and more flexible search method. The key difference is that legacy search finds only records that contain the exact words that you enter, in the exact order that you enter them in, whereas modern search finds records that contain matching words in any order.

For example, the CRONUS demo company has an item that is named **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue**. If you enter `London chair` as the search text, legacy search doesn't return any results, because that exact text doesn't match any part of the item name. However, modern search finds the item by matching the words "London" and "chair" separately.

If you want to find all blue chairs in the CRONUS demo company, you might enter either `blue chair` or `chair blue` as the search text. In this case, modern search retrieves not only **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue** but also **TOKYO Guest Chair, blue**. However, once again, legacy search returns no results. To get results by using legacy search, you must enter `chair, blue` as the search text.

If you want to mimic the behavior of legacy search when you use modern search, you can enclose your search text in quotation marks, just as you can do in popular search engines. In this way, you refine the results by excluding any that aren't exact matches. For example, if you enter `"blue chair"` as the search text, modern search returns no results, because that exact text doesn't occur in any item name in the demo data.

Another difference is that modern search finds words that *start* with the letters you have entered. If you enter 'hair', it won't find the word 'chair'.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Modern search covers only columns that a developer designates for it. If you can't find existing data, try legacy search.
>
>   Learn more about how to designate columns for modern search in [Enable optimized text search on table fields](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-field-text-search).
>
> - The search indexes used for modern search are updated in the background, usually within a few seconds. But in some cases, recent data changes don't immediately show up in modern search results.
>
> - If the **Use modern search** option isn't available on the dropdown menu, one of the following factors might be the cause:
>
>   - Modern search isn't enabled for your environment. Administrators can enable the **Use optimized text search in lists** feature on the **Feature Management** page. Learn more in [Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time](admin-feature-management.md).
>   - The list doesn't include any columns that are designated for modern search.
>
> - If modern search is enabled for your environment, it's the default search method.

### Fine-tune the search by using filter criteria (legacy search only)

You can make a more exact search by using filter operators, expressions, and filter tokens. Unlike filtering, these criteria are applied across all fields when they're used in the search field. Therefore, they're less efficient than filtering.

- To find only field values that exactly match the entire search text, and the case of it, enclose the text in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, enter `'man'`.
- To find field values that start with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) after the text. For example, enter `man*`.
- To find field values that end with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) before the text. For example, enter `*man`.
- When you use single quotation marks (`''`) or asterisks (`*`), the search is case-sensitive. To make it case-insensitive, add an at sign (`@`) before the search text. For example, enter `@man*`.

The following table provides some examples to explain how you can use the search.

| Search criterion | Information that is found |
|---|---|
| `man` or `Man` | All records where the value of any field contains the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, **manual**, or **Sportsman**. |
| `'Man'` | All records where the value of any field contains only the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. |
| `Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, but not the value **manual** or **Sportsman**. |
| `@Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester** or **manual**, but not the value **Sportsman**. |
| `@*man` | All records where the value of any field ends with **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Sportsman**, but not the value **Manchester** or **manual**. |

## <a name="filtering"></a>Filtering

Filtering provides a more advanced and versatile way to control which records are included in a list, a report, or an XMLport. There are two major differences between searching and filtering, as the following table shows.

| | Searching | Filtering |
|---|---|---|
| **Applicable fields** | Search across all fields that are visible on the page. | Filter one or more fields individually. Select from any field in the table, including fields that aren't visible on the page. |
| **Matching** | Show records where field values match the search text, regardless of the text's case or placement in the field. | Show records where field values exactly match the filter, including the text's case, unless special filter symbols are entered.

By specifying filter criteria, you can show records for specific accounts or customers, dates, amounts, and other information. Only records that match the criteria are shown in the list or included in the report, batch job, or XMLport. If you specify criteria for multiple fields, only records that match all criteria are shown.

For lists, the filters are shown in a filter pane that appears to the left of the list when you activate it. For reports, batch jobs, and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page.

### Filter by using option fields

For "ordinary" fields that hold data, setup date, or business data, you can set filters both by selecting data and by entering filter values. You can also use symbols to define advanced filter criteria. Learn more in the [Enter filter criteria](#enter-filter-criteria) section.

However, for fields of the **Option** type, you can set a filter only by selecting one or more available options in a dropdown list. An example of an option field is the **Status** field on the **Sales Orders** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select multiple options as a filter value, the relationship between the options is defined as *OR*. For example, if you select both the **Open** checkbox and the **Released** checkbox in the **Status** filter field on the **Sales Orders** page, the page shows all sales orders that are either open or released.

### Set filters on lists

For lists, you set filters by using the filter pane. To show the filter pane for a list, select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the page, and then select the **Show filter pane** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

To show the filter pane for a column in a list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>. The filter pane appears, and the selected column is shown as a filter field in the **Filter list by** section.

The filter pane shows the current filters for a list. You can set your own custom filters on one or more fields by selecting the **+&nbsp;Filter** action.

The filter pane is divided into three sections: **Views**, **Filter list by**, and **Filter totals by**:

- **Views** – Some lists include the **Views** section. *Views* are variations of the list that are preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want for each list. The views are available to you on any device that you sign in to. Learn more in [Save and personalize list views](ui-views.md).
- **Filter list by** – This section is where you add filters on specific fields to reduce the number of records that are shown. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.
- **Filter totals by** – Some lists that show calculated fields, such as amounts and quantities, include the **Filter totals by** section. Here, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Filters in the **Filter totals by** section are controlled by FlowFilters in the page design. Learn about the technical aspects of FlowFilters in [FlowFilters overview](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-flowfilter-overview).

By using the filter pane, you can set a simple filter directly on a list to show only records that have the same value as a selected cell. Select a cell in the list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter to This Value** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

### Set filters in reports, batch jobs, and XMLports

For reports and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page. The request page shows the last-used filters according to your selection in the **Use default values from** field. Learn more in [Use default values—predefined settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

The main **Filter** section shows the default filter fields that you use to define which records should be included in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

In the **Filter totals by** section, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

## Enter filter criteria

Both in the filter pane and on a request page, you enter your filter criteria in the box under the filter field.

The type of the filter field determines which criteria you can enter. For example, to filter a field that has fixed values, you can select only among those values. Learn more about special filter symbols in the [Filter criteria and operators](#FilterCriteria) and [Filter tokens](#FilterTokens) sections.

Columns that already have filters are indicated by the ![Filter icon.](media/ui-search/filter-icon.png "Filter icon") symbol in the column heading. To remove a filter, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Clear Filter** action.

> [!TIP]
> By learning to use key combinations (keyboard shortcuts), you can find and analyze your data more quickly. For example, select a field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to add that field to the filter pane, enter the filter criteria, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the rows, select another field, and then select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to filter to that value. Learn more in [Search and filter lists](keyboard-shortcuts.md#KeyboardFilter).

### <a name="FilterCriteria"></a>Filter criteria and operators

When you enter criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the field. In addition, there's a set of special symbols that you can use as operators to further filter the results. The following sections describe these symbols and explain how to use them as operators in filters.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about how to filter dates and times in [Work with calendar dates and times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In some situations, the value that you want to filter on might contain a symbol that is an operator. Learn more about how to handle these situations in the [Filter on values that contain symbols](#symbols) section.
> - If a single filter includes more than 200 operators, the system automatically uses parentheses (`()`) to group some expressions for processing. This behavior has no effect on the filter or the results.

#### (..) Interval

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1100..2100` | Numbers 1100 through 2100 |
| `..2500` | Numbers up to and including 2500 |
| `..12 31 00` | Dates up to and including 12 31 00 |
| `Bicycle..Car` | Strings "Bicycle" through "Car" when they're ordered lexicographically |
| `P8..` | Information for accounting period 8 and later |
| `..23` | From the beginning date until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 |
| `23..` | From 23-current month-current year 0:00:00 until the end of time |
| `22..23` | From 22-current month-current year 0:00:00 until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 | 

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a numeric keypad, the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key might produce a character other than a period (.). To switch to a period, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key on the keyboard together with the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key on the numeric keypad. To switch back, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> again. Learn more in [Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).

> [!NOTE]
> If you filter on a field of the **Text** type, lexicographic ordering is used to determine what is included in the interval. If a field of the **Text** type is used to store integers, this behavior can lead to unexpected results. For example, a filter on `10000..10042` also includes the values **100000** and **1000042**.

#### (&verbar;) Either/or

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1200|1300` | Numbers with 1200 or 1300 |

#### (<>) Not equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<>0` | All numbers except 0 |

> [!TIP]
> The SQL Server option lets you combine `<>` with a wildcard expression. For example, `<>A*` means "not equal to any text that starts with *A*."

#### (>) Greater than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>1200` | Numbers greater than 1200 |

#### (>=) Greater than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>=1200` | Numbers greater than or equal to 1200 |

#### (<) Less than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<1200` | Numbers less than 1200 |

#### (<=) Less than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<=1200` | Numbers less than or equal to 1200 |

#### (&) And

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>200&<1200` | Numbers greater than 200 and less than 1200 |

#### ('') An exact character match

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `'man'` | Text that exactly matches **man** and is case-sensitive |
| `''` | Text that is empty |

#### (@) Case-insensitive

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `@man*` | Text that starts with **man** and is case-insensitive |

#### (*) An indefinite number of unknown characters

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `*Co*` | Text that contains **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `*Co` | Text that ends with **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `Co*` | Text that begins with **Co** and is case-sensitive |

#### (?) One unknown character

|---|---|
| `Hans?n` | Text such as **Hansen** or **Hanson** |

#### Combined format expressions

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `5999|8100..8490` | Any records that have the number 5999 or a number in the range from 8100 through 8490 |
| `..1299|1400..` | Records that have a number that is less than or equal to 1299, or a number that is greater than or equal to 1400 (that is, all numbers except 1300 through 1399) |
| `>50&<100 `| Records that have a number that is greater than 50 and less than 100 (that is, all numbers from 51 through 99) |

### <a name="symbols"></a>Filter on values that contain symbols

There might be cases where field values contain one of the following symbols:

- &
- (
- )
- =
- &verbar;

If you want to filter on any of these symbols, enclose the filter expression in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, to filter on records that start with the text **J & V**, the filter expression is `'J & V*'`.

This requirement applies only to the five symbols in the preceding list.

### <a name="FilterTokens"></a>Filter tokens

When you enter filter criteria, you can also enter *filter tokens*, which are words that have special meaning. After you enter a filter token, it's replaced by the value or values that it represents. Filter tokens make filtering easier, because you don't have to open other pages to look up values that you want to add to your filter. The following sections describe some of the tokens that you can enter as filter criteria.

> [!TIP]
> Your organization might use custom tokens. To learn about the complete set of tokens that is available to you, or to add more custom tokens, contact your administrator. Learn about the technical aspects of filter tokens in [Adding Custom Filter Tokens](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-adding-filter-tokens).

#### (%me or %user) Records assigned to you

When you filter fields that contain a user ID, such as the **Assigned to User ID** field, use the `%me` or `%user` filter token to show all records that are assigned to you.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%me` or `%user` | Records that are assigned to your user account |

#### (%mycustomers) Customers in My Customers

In the customer number (**No**) field, use the `%mycustomers` filter token to show all records for customers that are included in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%mycustomers` | Customers in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myitems) Items in My Items

In the item number (**No**) field, use the `%myitems` filter token to show all records for items that are included in the **My Items** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myitems` | Items in the **My Items** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myvendors) Vendors in My Vendors

In the vendor number (**No**) field, use the `%myvendors` filter token to show all records for vendors that are included in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myvendors` | Vendors in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center |

# Create production orders

Typically, businesses use the planning engine to create production orders automatically to fulfill a known demand. To learn more, go to [Planning](production-planning.md). However, you can create a production order manually. This article describes how to create a firm planned production order. You can also create production orders with a different status.  

## To create a production order header

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **No.** field, add the next number in the number series you use for production orders.  
4. In the **Source Type** field, select the source of the production order:

   - **Item**: Standard items that you produce for inventory.
   - **Family**: A predefined family of items that you produce for inventory. To learn more, go to [Work With Production Families](production-how-work-family.md).
   - Sales header: Items are produced for the sales order that you specify in the **Source No.** field.
5. In the **Source No.** field, select the item number, family, or sales header for which to create the production order.  
6. Fill in the **Quantity** and **Due Date** fields according to your specifications.  
7. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, specify the item to produce.
8. In the **Due Date** field, specify when the item is needed. For example, for a sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Starting Date-Time** and **Ending Date-Time** fields are automatically filled in based on the item's routing and the value that you enter in the **Due Date** field.

9. In the **Quantity** field, specify how many units to produce on the line.

When production requirements change, such as components or operations, you can quickly replan the production order. To learn more, go to [Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.

## LCY and other currencies

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-lcy-def](includes/finance-currencies-lcy-def.md)]

## Rounding currencies

To manage currencies that don't use decimals and to avoid unnecessary decimals in foreign currency, you can use two different rounding features:

- Unit-amount rounding  

- Amount rounding  

These features can operate independently or in combination. In addition, the features can operate with invoice rounding.

As opposed to the invoice rounding features, the amount rounding and unit-amount rounding features affect only amounts in foreign currency-not the corresponding amounts in LCY. These two features don't post anything to general ledger accounts. So, no general ledger account needs to be specified on posting groups or elsewhere.

### Unit-amount rounding

The unit-amount rounding feature controls how sales prices for items and resources in foreign currencies are rounded on sales and purchase lines. You must specify the rules for each currency separately, in the **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision** field in the **Currencies** list.

The unit-amount rounding feature is used automatically every time you enter an item or resource number on a sales line. If the invoice is for a customer with a currency code, the item or resource price is converted into the customer's currency. The price is rounded according to the unit-amount rounding precision for the currency.

### Amount rounding

The amount rounding feature controls how amounts in foreign currencies are rounded on general journal lines, sales lines, and purchase lines. You must specify the rules for each currency separately, in the **Amount Rounding Precision** field in the **Currencies** list.

Amounts in foreign currencies are rounded when you fill in and post general journal lines, sales lines, and purchase lines.

## Exchange rates

You can register exchange rates for each foreign currency and specify from which dates the exchange rates are valid. For example, you can enter daily exchange rates, monthly exchange rates, or quarterly exchange rates for each foreign currency.

You can retain historical exchange rates in the **Currency Exchange Rates** page for reference purposes. When you need to update exchange rates, you can use the **Update Exchange Rates** button to get the latest exchange rates from an external service provider.

## General ledger accounts

You can't link currency codes to general ledger accounts because amounts on general ledger accounts are in LCY. If you have a bank loan in USD and place deposits in a bank account in SEK, you can keep track of these accounts by setting up bank accounts in USD and SEK. With posting groups, you can link the accounts to the relevant general ledger accounts. In the general ledger, the value of the amounts is shown in LCY.

You can enter a currency code on a general journal line and post the line to a general ledger account. The relevant exchange rate is used to convert the amount to LCY before it posts to the general ledger account.

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

# Record and reimburse employees' expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employees in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization might have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is flexible enough to suit many different practices. The exact account numbers to use depend on your organization's configuration and processes.  

You can use general journals for employee accounts to register employee expenses and reimbursement transactions in foreign currencies, and then easily track the amounts and compare them to receipts. Leave your calculator in your desk drawer—Business Central can adjust the exchange rate for you. When you use general journals to post transactions for employee accounts, such as when you reimburse expenses, you can use the **Currency Code** field to specify the currency for the transactions. Specifying a currency lets you use the same features as when you register transactions in the customer and vendor ledgers. For example, employees can register an expense in euros but get paid in dollars.

To ensure that the exchange rate for the amounts is up to date, you can adjust employee balances when you run the currency exchange rate batch job. If you want to use the exchange rate table, but settle employee balances in your local currency, you can exclude employee accounts when you adjust exchange rates.

## To record an employee's expense

You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee

You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries

You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).

# Run Batch Jobs and XMLports

A batch job is a routine that processes data in batches, for example the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. There are batch jobs that perform periodic accounting activities, such as closing the income statement at the end of a fiscal year. Many batch jobs do calculation work, such as calculation of finance charges, exchange rate adjustment, and calculation of unit prices.

A batch job is like a report, except the batch job uses the result of its work to update information directly, instead of printing the results.

You can schedule when a batch job runs. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To run a batch job
1. To open the request page for the relevant batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the batch job, and then choose the related link.
2. If there is an **Options** FastTab for the batch job, fill in the fields to determine what the batch job will do.
3. The page may contain one or more FastTab with filters, which you can use to limit the data included in the batch job. You can enter criteria in the suggested filters or add more filters.
4. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.

# Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies

If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

## To enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Appln. between Currencies** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |Application between currencies is not allowed. |
| EMU |Application between EMU currencies is allowed. |
| All |Application between all currencies is allowed. |

## To set up G/L accounts for currency application rounding differences

If you apply entries in different currencies, you must set up the general ledger accounts to which you want to post rounding differences.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up the general ledger accounts before you complete the task. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
4. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.

# Walkthrough: Set up and use a purchase approval workflow

You can automate the process of approving new or changed records, such as documents, journal lines, and customer cards, by creating workflows with steps for the approvals in question.

Before you create approval workflows, you must set up an approver and substitute approver for each approval user. To define which sales and purchase records they're qualified to approve, you can also set amount limits for approvers. Approval requests and other notifications can be sent as emails or internal notes. For each approval user setup, you can also set up when they receive notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the workflow functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use Power Automate to define workflows for events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Note that although they're two separate workflow systems, any flow template that you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Use Business Central in an Automated Workflow](across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow.md).  

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough is a scenario illustrating the following tasks:  

- Setting up approval users  
- Setting up notifications for approval users  
- Modifying and enabling an approval workflow  
- Requesting approval of a purchase order (as Alicia)  
- Receiving a notification and then approving the request (as Sean)  

## Story

Sean is a super user at CRONUS and creates two approval users. One is Alicia who represents a purchasing agent. The other is Sean themself, representing Alicia's approver. Sean then gives themself unlimited purchase approval rights and specifies that they'll receive notifications by internal note as soon as a relevant event occurs. Finally, Sean creates the required approval workflow as a copy of the existing *Purchase Order Approval Workflow* template, leaves all existing event conditions and response options unchanged, and then enables the workflow.  

To test the approval workflow, Sean signs in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as Alicia and then requests approval of a purchase order. Sean then signs in as themself, sees the note in the Role Center, follows the link to the approval request for the purchase order, and approves the request.  

## Users

Before you can set up approval users and their notification method, you must make sure that those users exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]: One user will represent Alicia. The other user, yourself, will represent Sean. Learn more at [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

### Set up approval users

When signed in as yourself, set up Alicia as an approval user whose approver is yourself. Set up your approval rights and specify how and when you're notified of approval requests.  

#### To set up yourself and Alicia as approval users

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Approval User Setup** page, choose the **New** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You must set up an approver before you can set up users who require that approver's approval. That means you must set yourself up before you can set Alicia up.  

3. Set up the two approval users by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |User ID|Approver ID|Unlimited Purchase Approval|  
    |-------|-----------|---------------------------|  
    |YOU||Selected|
    |ALICIA|YOU||

### Set up notifications

In this walkthrough, the user is notified by an internal note about requests to approve. Approval notifications can also be sent by email, and you can add a workflow response step that notifies the sender when a request is approved or rejected. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md).

#### To set up how and when you're notified

1. On the **Approval User Setup** page, select the line for yourself, and then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
2. On the **Notification Setup** page, in the **Notification Type** field, choose **Approval**.  
3. In the **Notification Method** field, choose **Note**.  
4. On the **Notification Setup** page, choose the **Notification Schedule** action.  
5. On the **Notification Schedule** page, in the **Recurrence** field, select **Instantly**.  

## Create the approval workflow

Create the purchase order approval workflow by copying the steps from the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow** template. Leave the existing workflow steps unchanged, and then enable the workflow.  

> [!TIP]
> Optionally, add a workflow response step to notify the sender when their request is approved or rejected. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md).

### To create and enable a purchase order approval workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, select **Actions**, then select **New**, and then choose the **New Workflow from Template** action.  
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, select the workflow template named **Purchase Order Approval Workflow**.  

   The **Workflow** page opens for a new workflow containing all the information of the selected template. The value in the **Code** field is extended with *-01* to indicate this is the first workflow created from the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow** template.  
4. On the header of the **Workflow** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.  

## Use the approval workflow

Use the new Purchase Order Approval Workflow by first signing in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as Alicia to request approval of a purchase order. Then sign in as yourself, view the note on the Role Center, follow the link to the approval request, then approve the request.  

### To request approval of a purchase order, as Alicia

1. Sign in as Alicia.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.  
3. Select the line to open *Purchase Order 106001*.  
4. On the **Purchase Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Request Approval**, and then choose the **Send Approval Request** action.  

Notice that the value in the **Status** field has changed to **Pending Approval**.  

### To approve the purchase order, as Sean

1. Sign in as Sean.
2. On the Role Center, in the **Self Service** area, choose **Requests to Approve**.
3. On the **Requests to Approve** page, select the line about the purchase order from Alicia, then choose the **Approve** action.  

The value in the **Status** field on Alicia's purchase order changes to **Released**.  

You have now set up and tested a simple approval workflow based on the first two steps of the **Purchase Order Approval Workflow**. You can easily extend this workflow to automatically post Alicia's purchase order when Sean approves it. To do this, you must enable the **Purchase Invoice Workflow**, so the response to a released purchase invoice is to post it. First you must change the event condition on the first workflow step from (purchase) **Invoice** to **Order**.  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many workflow templates for scenarios that are supported by the application code. Most of these templates are for approval workflows.  

You define variations of workflows by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start a search.

When you start typing characters on the **Tell me what you want to do** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word *product* and the results include *items*, that's because search uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it opens a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell me what you want to do** page, the **exploring pages and reports** action opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

The **Tell me what you want to do** page categorizes results based on the data that you enter and the page you're working on. The following sections describe the categories.

## Find an action on the current page

The **On current page** section lets you find actions on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the Customer Card page for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs aren't included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer pages and tasks than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. Learn more about user experiences in [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find a record or search the documentation

The **Search for \<keyword\>** section [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple of ways to search:

* Use the **Search company data** action to search all pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about how the company data search works in [Search for a record in company data](ui-search-data.md).
* Use the **Search Help** action to find an article in the Business Central documentation that contains your keyword.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Your search results won't include documentation for third-party extensions.

### Use Tell me what you want to do

Use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you can find a customer by entering their name or address, or even find a specific record, such as a sales order. You can also use it to find information in our documentation.

Just enter at least three characters of a keyword, and then choose either **Search company data** or **Search Help**.

* If you search for data, results display on the **Search in company data** page, where they're sorted by type.  
* If you search in our Help, the **Help** pane offers links to articles that contain your keywords. You'll also get a snippet from the article that can help you decide whether it's what you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> For data, searching everything in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might take time. To speed up results, use the **Show tables to search** action to choose the tables and fields that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Use search on list pages

It isn't related to Tell me what you want to do, but there's another way to search for specific data. When you're using a list page, you can use the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** field in the left corner of list page headers to search for data on the page. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. Learn more about working with data on list pages in [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#searching).

# Assembly Management

Companies can supply products to customers by combining components without using manufacturing features. Features for assembling items integrate with related features such as sales, planning, reservations, and warehousing.  

An assembly item is a sellable item that contains an assembly BOM. To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md).

Assembly orders are internal orders, just like production orders. Use assembly orders to manage the assembly process and to connect sales requirements with warehouse activities. Assembly orders involve both output and consumption when posting. Assembly order headers are similar to output journal lines. Assembly order lines are similar to consumption journal lines.  

You can use a just-in-time inventory strategy and customize products to meet customer requests. Assembly orders can be automatically created and linked when you create a sales order line. The link between the sales demand and assembly supply opens up for several opportunities when you process sales orders:

* Customize assembly items on the fly.
* Promise delivery dates according to component availability.
* Post output and shipment of the assembled item directly from their sales orders.

To learn more about selling assembly items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

Lines on sales orders can contain items to pick from stock and items to assemble for the order. The assemble-to-order quantities take priority over inventory quantities in partial shipping. To learn more about selling stock and assembly items, go to [Combination Scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

When an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to ship, a warehouse employee can post an inventory pick for the sales order lines. Posting an inventory pick does a couple of things:

* Create an inventory movement for the components
* Post the assembly output and the sales order shipment.

To learn more about assemble-to-order items and inventory picks, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

# (Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

By default, reports have a built-in layout. The report layout can be either an RDLC (report definition language client side) report layout, a Microsoft Word report layout, or both. And while you can't modify built-in layouts, you can create custom layouts. A report can have multiple custom report layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations you send to customers as PDF files.

To create a custom layout, either copy an existing custom layout or add a new custom layout. Custom layouts are often based on a built-in layout. When you add a new custom layout, you can choose to add either an RDLC or a Word report layout type, or both. The new custom layout is based on the built-in layout for the report, if one is available. If there's no built-in layout for the report type, a new blank layout is created. You modify and design this blank layout from scratch. Learn more about RDLC, Word, built-in, and custom layouts in [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Learn more at [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

After you define your custom report layouts, you can select them on the customer card and vendor card pages. The layouts are then used when you create documents for the customer or vendor. Learn more at [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

You can also use custom report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Create a custom layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports available in the company specified in the **Company Name** field at the top of the page.
1. In the **Company Name** field, choose the company you want to create the report layout for.
1. Select the row for the report you want to create the layout for, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

   The **Custom Report Layouts** page appears and lists all the custom layouts available for the selected report.
1. If you want to create a copy of an existing custom layout, select the existing custom layout in the list, then choose the **Copy** action.  

   The copy of the custom layout appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page and has the words *Copy of* in the **Description** field.
1. If you want to add a new custom layout based on a built-in layout, follow these steps:  
   1. Choose the **New** action. The **Insert Built-in Layout for a Report** page appears with the **ID** and **Name** fields automatically filled in.
   1. Turn on the **Insert Word Layout** toggle to add a custom Word report layout type OR turn on the **Insert RDLC Layout** toggle to add a custom RDLC report layout type.
   1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The new custom layout now appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If a new layout is based on a built-in layout, then the words **Copy of a Built-in Layout** appear in the **Description** field. If there was no built-in layout for the report, then the new layout has the words **New Layout** in the **Description** field, which means that custom layout is blank.
1. By default, the **Company Name** field is blank and the custom layout is available for reports by all companies. To make the custom layout available to a specific company only, choose **Edit**, then set the **Company Name** field to the company you want.

The custom layout is created and you can modify it as you like.

> [!TIP]
> You can export the report results to a Microsoft Excel file to view the full dataset, including all columns, but without the layout. The Excel file can help you validate the report returns the expected data or diagnose problems. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel](report-analyze-excel.md).

## <a name="ModifyCustomLayout"></a>Modifying a custom layout

To modify a custom report layout, you must first export the report layout as a file to a location on your computer or network. Then, open the exported document and make the changes. When you're finished making the changes, you import the report layout.

### Modify a custom layout

1. Export a custom layout from the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If that page isn't already open, search for and open the **Report Layout Selection** page, select the report that has the layout you want to modify, then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  
1. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the layout you want to modify, choose the **Export Layout** action, then choose **Save** or **Save As** to save the report layout document to a location on your computer or network.  
1. Open the report layout document you saved and make changes.

   If you're changing a Word layout, open the layout document in Word. Learn more about editing Word reports at [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)<!--the next section [Making Changes to the Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#MakeChangesToLayout)-->.

   RDLC report layouts are more advanced than Word report layouts. Learn more about modifying an RDLC report layout at [Designing RDLC Report Layouts](/dynamics-nav/Designing-RDLC-Report-Layouts).

   Remember to save your changes when you're done.

1. Return to the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the report layout you exported and modified, then choose the **Import Layout** action.  
1. In the **Import** dialog box, select **Choose** to find and select the modified report layout document, then choose **Open**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to import the report layout document that you modified. Otherwise, the new report layout isn't available.

<!--
##  <a name="MakeChangesToLayout"></a> Create and modify custom report layouts

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

### Embedding fonts in Word layouts for consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

###  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields in Word layouts

 Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

 ![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

 The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field you want to delete, then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.  

### Adding data fields

Adding data fields from a report dataset is more advanced and requires some knowledge of the report dataset. Learn more about adding fields for data, labels, and images at [Add Fields to a Word Report Layout](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).  -->

# Work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

While you're working in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you interact with data in different ways. For example, you create records, enter data, sort and filter data, write notes, and export data to other applications.

There are lots of ways to customize the appearance of pages:

- Adjust the size and position of any page.
- Expand the width of columns and increase the height of column headers.
- Change how you sort data in columns.

If you want to use the horizontal scroll bar to view all columns on a list page or on document lines, there's a vertical freeze pane to keep some columns from scrolling.

## Getting around in Business Central

Here's a short video about how to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqz03iMihx0]

## Choosing a desktop browser

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple browsers, and each browser offers various features. The browser plays a significant role in the responsiveness and fluidity of the user interface. Check out the list of supported, recommended browsers for [Business Central online](./product-requirements.md) and browsers for [Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/system-requirement-business-central-v15).

- Where possible, avoid older browsers such as Internet Explorer. Instead, switch to one of our recommended modern browsers, such as the [new Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Internet Explorer is no longer supported. To learn more, go to [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4337664/microsoft-edge-help).
- Keep your browser up to date with the latest version.

## Action bars

Inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you do most of your work in a list, a document, or a card. All pages have a bar with actions that are relevant to them. The actions are almost the same for the individual card or document and the list of entities. This way, you can manage an individual sales order in the **Sales Order** page and in the **Sales Orders** list, including posting it and invoicing it.  

How you open a page and the context of what you're doing affect whether actions are available. Actions can appear differently, not be available, or even not be present. Not all actions are relevant, or supported, for all processes. Also, some actions require that you make a selection. If an action isn't relevant or supported, we make them unavailable. We do that to help clarify what you can do with your selections.

Specifically for list pages, the list page that you open from the home page and the page that opens when you use the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to search for it aren't identical.  

When you search for and open a list page, such as the **Sales Orders** list, it's in view mode. The actions for editing, viewing, or deleting an individual entity, such as a sales order, are shown when you choose the **Manage** action.  

> [!TIP]
> If you know that you'll often use actions on the second level of the action bar, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/pin.png" border="false"::: icon to pin the action bar and make the actions under the various menus immediately discoverable.
>
> To hide the second level of the action bar again, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/unpin.png" border="false"::: icon.

When you open the same list page from your home page, the **Manage** action isn't available. Instead, to open an individual sales order, choose the **Number** field. In this view, you can't pin the action bar.

# Flush components according to operation output

You can define different flushing strategies to automate the registration of consumption of components.

This feature is useful for the following reasons:  

- **Inventory Valuation**

    Value entries for output and consumption are created in parallel as the production order progresses. Without routing link codes, the inventory value increases as output is posted and decreases later when you post the consumption with the finished production order.  
- **Inventory Availability**

    With gradual consumption posting, the availability of component items is more up-to-date, which is important to maintain the internal balance between demand and supply. Without routing link codes, other demands for the component might believe that it's available as long as it's pending a delayed consumption posting.  
- **Just-in-Time**

    With the ability to customize products to customer requests, you can minimize waste by making sure that work and system changes only occur when it's necessary.  

- **Reduce data entry**

    The ability to automatically flush an operation lets you automate the entire process of recording consumption and output. The disadvantage of using automatic flushing is that you might not accurately record, or even be aware of, scrap.

## Automatic consumption posting (flushing) methods  

- Forward Flush the Entire Order  
- Forward Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing the Entire Order  

### Forward flush an entire order  

Forward flushing a production order at the start of the job is similar to a manual consumption. The significant difference is that consumption happens automatically.  

- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed.  
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM, multiplied by the number of parent items you're building.  
- There's no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed.  
- When you consume items from inventory, it doesn't matter when output journal entries are made because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting.  
- No routing link codes can be set.  

Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with:  

- A low number of defects.  
- A low number of operations.  
- High component consumption in early operations.  

### Forward flushing by operation  

Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item. Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes, which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM.  

The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started. Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation. And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered.  

The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items you're building (expected quantity).  

This technique is best employed when there are many operations and certain components aren't needed until late in the assembly sequence. In fact, a Just-in-Time (JIT) setup might not even have the items on hand when the RPO is begun.  

Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes. Some components might not be used until final assembly operations and shouldn't be withdrawn from stock until that time.  

### Back flushing by operation  

Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal.  

The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known.  

Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes. The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity.  

The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items posted as output for the operation. This quantity might be different than the expected quantity.  

### Back flushing an entire order  

This reporting method doesn't consider routing link codes.  

No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to *Finished*. The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that you finished and put in inventory.  

Backward flushing the entire production order requires the same setup as for forward flushing: The reporting method must be set to backward on each item card for all items within the parent BOM to be reported. In addition, all routing link codes must be removed from the production BOM. 

For example, if a production order to produce 800 meters requires 8 kg of a component, then when you post 200 meters as output, 2 kg are automatically posted as consumption.

You can achieve that by combining backward flushing method and routing link codes so that the quantity that is flushed for each operation is proportional to the actual output of the finished operation. For items that are set up with backward flushing method, the default behavior is to calculate and post component consumption when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. If you also define routing link codes, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished, and the quantity that was consumed in the operation is posted. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## To flush components according to operation output

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Flushing Method** field, select **Backward**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Select **Pick + Backward** if the component is used in a location that is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Define routing link codes for every operation that consumes the component. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Don't use the same routing link for different operations in the routing. Using the same routing link would lead to registration of consumption of component for each linked operation.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Define routing link codes from each instance of the component to the operation that consumes it.

The consumption is posted automatically when you register output. To learn more, go to [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).

## Flushing methods

The following table describes the flushing method options that you can specify on **Item** cards and **Stockkeeping Unit** cards.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-------------|  
|Manual|You can manually consume items without picking. For each item, stockkeeping unit, or production order component line you can ignore the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** setting in the **Location Card** page. Skipping warehouse or inventory picks is typical for automatic flushing methods, such as **Backward** and **Forward**. It might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, they might require manual posting of consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can very or they require item tracking.<br><br>To start using this feature, on the **Feature Management** page, activate **Feature Update: 'Manual' flushing method without requiring pick**. Existing records upgrade from **Manual** to the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. The **Pick + Manual** option is added immediately and works, regardless of whether you enable the feature key. If the feature isn't enabled, **Manual** and **Pick + Manual** both require picking due to the original behavior. When the feature key is enabled, the **Manual** option doesn't require picking.|
|Forward|Automatically posts consumption according to the production order component lines. <br><br>By default, the posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a production order to **Released**. However, if you use the **Routing Link** Code field on production order component lines, then posting occurs per operation when the operation starts. For more information, see [How to: Create Routing Links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links). <br><br> **Note**<br>For the forward flushing option, the operation-specific posting that you get with routing link codes is based on the expected quantity that is defined on the component line. For information about operation-specific flushing based on actual output, see the description of **Backward** in this article.<br><br>If the location or resources where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md). <br><br> **Important** <br>Forward flushing also occurs when you choose **Refresh** on a released production order that was created from scratch. On the released production orders, you can't change bin information because you generate the production order component lines when you refresh the order. Refreshing the order forward flushes the components. Therefore, if you want to change bin information on production order component lines before forward flushing occurs, then that order must be created with the *Planned* or *Firm Planned* status.|
|Backward|Automatically calculates and posts consumption according to the production order component lines.<br><br> By default, the calculation and posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. However, if you use the **Routing Link Code** field on the production order component lines, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished.<br><br> **Note** <br>Backward flushing and routing link codes can be combined so that the quantity that is flushed per operation is proportional to the actual output of that operation. For more information, see [How to: Flush Components According to Operation Output](#to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output).<br><br> If the location or machine center where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**.|
|Pick + Forward|Same as for Forward flushing method, except it only works for locations that use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.<br><br> **Note** <br>If a component uses the Pick + Forward flushing method, it can't have a routing link code to an operation that uses the forward flushing method. The component would then be automatically flushed when the operation starts, which makes it impossible to request the pick activity.|
|Pick + Backward|Same as for Backward flushing method, except it only works for locations use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.|
|Pick + Manual|Require picking if consumption needs to happen at a location where warehouse handling is enabled.|

# Create bins

The most effective way to create the bins of your warehouse is to generate groups of similar bins in the bin creation worksheet, but you can also create your bins individually from the location card. You can also use a function on the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page to create bins automatically.  

## To create a bin from the location card

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### The dedicated field

The **Dedicated** field on the **Bins** page specifies that quantities in the bin are protected from being picked for other demands. However, quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

Making a bin dedicated results in similar functionality in basic warehousing to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

### Example

A work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code.

> [!Caution]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production or assembly components with the **Inventory Pick** page. For more information, see [Pick for Production or Assembly in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

## To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you're creating.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bins** action.  

## To make bins automatically in the bin creation worksheet

Before you start creating bins automatically, you should determine the kind of bins that are essential for your operations, and the most practical flow of items through the physical structure of your warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As soon as you use a bin, you cannot delete it unless it is empty. But if you want to use another bin-naming system, you can use the reclassification journal to in effect move your items to a new bin system. This process is manual and takes time, however, so it is best to set up your bins correctly from the start.  

To work with the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page, you must be set up as a warehouse employee at the location where the bins exist. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).    

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Bins** action.
3. On the **Calculate Bins** page, in the **Bin Template Code** field, select the bin template that you want to use as the model for the bins you're creating.
4.  Fill in a description for the bins you are in the process of creating.  
5.  To create the bin codes, fill in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields in the three categories shown on the page: **Rack**, **Section,**, and **Level.** The bin code can contain up to 20 characters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The number of characters that you have entered in the three categories for either field, for example, the characters you have entered in the three **From No.** fields, plus the field separators, if any, must be 20 or less.  

     You can use letters in the code as an identifying combination, but the letter you use must be the same in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields. For example, you might define the Rack part of the code as **From No. A01** and **To No. A10**. The application isn't set up to generate codes with letter sequences, for example, from A01 to F05.  

6.  If you want a character, such as a hyphen, to separate the category fields you have defined as part of the bin code, fill in the **Field Separator** field with this character.  
7.  If you want application not to create a line for a bin if it exists already, select the **Check on Existing Bin** field.  
8. When you finish filling in the fields, choose the **OK** button.

    The application creates a line for each bin in the worksheet. You can now delete some of the bins, for example, if you have a rack with a passageway through the first two levels of a couple of sections.  

9. When you delete all unnecessary bins, choose the **Create Bins** action, and application creates bins for each line in the worksheet.  

Repeat the process for another set of bins until you create all the bins in your warehouse.

# Report and document layouts overview

A report layout controls content and format of the report. For example, the data fields in the report dataset that appear on the report, how they're arranged, the text style, images, and so on. From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can change which layout is used on a report, create new layout, or modify the existing layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations that you send to customers as PDF files.

You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Introduction

A report layout sets up the following things:

* The label and data fields to include from the dataset of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report.
* The text format, such as font type, size, and color.
* The company logo and its position.
* General page settings, such as margins and background images.

You can set up multiple layouts for a report, and then switch between them to suit different reporting needs.

<!--You can use one of the built-in report layouts or you can create custom report layouts and assign them to your reports as needed. Learn more in [Create a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).-->

There are two important aspects of report layouts that influence how you work with them:

* The **Layout Type** indicates the kind of file that the layout is based on.
* The **Layout Source** indicates the origin of the layout.

## Layout types

There are four types of layouts that you can use for reports:

* Word
* RDLC
* Excel
* External

### Word

Word layouts are based on Word documents (.docx file type). Word layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Microsoft Word. A Word layout determines the report's content - controlling how that content elements are arranged and how they look. A Word layout document typically uses tables to arrange content, where the cells can contain data fields, text, or pictures.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout-overview.png)](media/word-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

<!--![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/nav_wordreportlayout_edit_in_word_example.png) -->

Learn more in [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).

### Excel

Excel layouts are based on Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx file type). They let you create reports by using familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data with tools like formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and more.

[![Shows the an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)](media/excel-layout-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

### RDLC

RDLC layouts are based on client report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). These layouts are created and modified by using SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft RDLC Report Designer. The design concept for RDLC layouts is similar to Word layouts, where the layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word layouts.

[![Shows the an example of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png)](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md).

### External

An external layout type refers to an advanced type designed for specific reports. The reports and the layouts themselves are typically provided by partners, not Microsoft. The actual file type of the layout varies depending on the provider.

Learn more in [Developing a Custom Report Render](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-custom-render).

## Layout sources

In addition to the type, layouts are further divided into three categories, based on their source or origin.

* Extension layouts

   Extension layouts are layouts that are part of an extension installed in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. These layouts are typically standard layouts provided by Microsoft, for example, in the base application. Or, they could be layouts that are included in extensions from other software providers. You can identify extension layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column shows the extension name and publisher.

* User-defined layouts

   The other source of layouts is the people who use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. People with the right permissions can add new layouts in various ways. For example, you could start from an existing extension layout or a user-defined layout. You can identify user-defined layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column is blank.

   Learn more in [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

* Custom layouts (obsolete)

  Custom layouts are also layouts that users create. The difference is that these layouts are created from the now obsolete **Custom Report Layouts** page, and they can only be Word and RDLC type. Although you can still create custom layouts, they're being phased out in favor of user-defined layouts.

  Learn more in [(Obsolete) Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

To learn more about which type is best for you, go to [Decide what type of layout you want](ui-get-started-layouts.md#decide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing to remember is that you can't modify extension layouts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. For example, you can't change the layout name or type, or upload and replace it with another version. If you try, an error message displays. You can create a user-defined or custom layout based on the extension layout instead.

<!--
### Built-in and custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in layouts. Built-in layouts are predefined layouts that are designed for specific reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reports will have a built-in layout as either an RDLC report layout, Word report layout, or in some cases both. You can’t modify a built-in report layout from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you use them as a starting point for building your own custom report layouts.

Custom layouts are report layouts that you design to change the appearance of a report. You typically create a custom layout based on a built-in layout, but you can create them from scratch or from a copy of an existing custom layout. Custom layouts enable you to have multiple layouts for the same report, which you switch among as needed. For example, you can have different layouts for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, or you can have different layouts for the same company for specific occasions or events, like a special campaign or holiday season.

Deciding on whether to use a Word, Excel, or RDLC layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look and your knowledge of tools for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This means that the same report might look different when using the Word report layout compared to the RDLC report layout.

* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC report layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Word and especially Excel layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC report layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

For information about how to switch the layout currently used on a report, see [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md).

-->

## View report layout lifecycle telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send data to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure about the actions users take on report layouts, like adding, modifying, deleting, and more. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. Learn more in the following articles of the Developer and IT Pro help:

* [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)
* [Analyzing report layout lifecycle telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-report-layout-lifecycle-trace?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json)

# Closing the books
After you ensure that all your accounts are up-to-date, and you allocate costs and income, then you can close the books for a fiscal year or period.

You aren't required to close a year, but doing so will make working in the system easier for you because you'll be able to take advantage of the convenient filtering options provided. You also don't have to worry about losing details of transactions when you close because all details are retained, even after you close the year.

## Closing book process
The process for closing the book includes these main tasks:

1. Closing the accounting period.

    A fiscal year is defined as one or more open periods as defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. A typical fiscal year contains 12 periods of one month each, but you can also choose another method of defining a year.

    For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Registering prior-year entries.

    When you close a fiscal year, you must enter a number of administrative transactions (such as prepaid and accrued items). These transactions are called adjusting entries. There are no special rules for posting these entries, and they (like other entries) contain a check mark in the **Prior-Year Entry** field if they're posted on a date in a closed fiscal year. Even though a fiscal year has been closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it.
3. Transferring balances from the income statement accounts to the balance sheet.

    After a fiscal year has been closed and all prior-year entries have been posted, the income statement accounts must be closed and the net income for the year must be transferred to an account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Use the Close Income Statement batch job for this purpose. The batch job processes all general ledger accounts of the type Income Statement and creates entries that reverse their balances. These entries are placed in a journal from which they can be posted. The batch job doesn't post them automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is used. When an additional reporting currency is used, the batch job posts directly to the general ledger.

    For more information, see [Close Income Statement](year-close-income-statement.md).
4. Posting the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries.

    When the Close Income Statement batch job is finished, you post the entries generated by the job. If you didn't specify a retained earnings account in the batch job, then enter one line with a balancing entry that posts the net income to the correct general ledger account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Finally, post the journal.

    For more information, see [Post Year-End Closing Entry](year-how-post-year-end-close-entry.md).

## What happens when you close

When you close at the end of the year, the system moves your earnings from calculated earnings to the Retained Earnings account. The system also marks the fiscal year as "closed," and marks all subsequent entries for the closed year as "prior year entries."

The system then generates a closing entry, but it doesn't post the entry automatically. You're given the opportunity to make the offsetting equity account entry or entries, which allows you to decide how to allocate your closing entry. For example, if your company has several divisions, you can let the system generate a single closing entry for all the divisions, and you can then make an offsetting entry for each division's equity account.

You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the Close Income Statement batch job again afterward.

# Walkthrough: Tracing Serial/Lot Numbers

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

When product defects occur, the errors must be identified and affected items must be prevented from leaving the company. If defective items have already been shipped, you must trace who received them and, if you need to, recall the items.  

The first task of defects management is to investigate where the defective items came from and where they were used. This investigation is based on historic data and is made easier by searching through item tracking entries using the **Item Tracing** page.  

The second task of defects management is to determine whether the traced items are planned for in open documents, such as non-posted sales orders or consumption journals. This work is performed on the **Find entries** page. You can use the Find Entries feature to search all kinds of database records.  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective, which vendor supplied them, and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled.  

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Tracing usage to origin.  
- Tracing origin to usage.  
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial/lot number.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Quality Controller  
- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.  
<!-- - To create new items and several business transactions by following the [Prepare Sample Data](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md#prepare-sample-data).   -->

## Story

Ricardo, the quality controller, is acting on a sales return of item 1002, Racing Bike. The customer, Selangorian Ltd., complained that the frame has cracked welding seams. Quality control engineers have confirmed that the racing frame of the returned bike is defective. The quality controller must now determine:  

- Which lot of racing frames was faulty.  
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received.  

From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, had the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they must determine where the finished racing bike was last used, and then they must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty component, the racing frame, came from.  

The results of this first item tracking task identify which racing frames were defective and which vendor supplied them. Afterward, but in the same overall tracking process, the quality controller must find all the sold racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those orders can be stopped or recalled. Lastly, the quality controller must find any open documents where the faulty lot is used so that no additional transactions are made.  

The first two defects-management tasks are performed on the **Item Tracing** page. The last task is performed on the **Find entries** page in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.  

## Prepare Sample Data

You must create the following new items:  

- 2000, Racing Frame: lot-specific tracking, component of 1002

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames.  

    This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Find Entries features.  

## Tracing from Usage to Origin

 From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, has the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they can determine where the finished racing bike was last used, in this case, on the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd.. Then, the quality controller must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty racing frame came from and which vendor supplied it.  

### To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Item Tracing** page, enter **SN1** in the **Serial No. Filter** field, and then enter **1002** in the **Item Filter** field.  
3.  Keep the default setting of **Item-Tracked Only** in the **Show Components** field, and keep the default trace method of **Usage – Origin** in the **Trace Method**.  
4.  Choose the **Trace** action.  

    Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria. Before you continue the trace, verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd.  

5.  Select the trace line, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1.  
6.  Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from.  

    You can trace the following transaction history:  

    - The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order.  
    - The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order. Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used.  
    - The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory.  

    The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and they can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them, namely Custom Metals Incorporated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result, as you will use it in the next section.  

     This completes the first defects-management task using the **Item Tracing** page. The quality controller must now determine whether other posted documents have processed racing frames from LOT1.  

## Tracing from Origin to Usage

 The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1. They must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled.  

 One way to prepare this trace task on the **Item Tracing** page is to manually enter LOT1 in the **Lot No. Filter** field and 2000 in the **Item Filter** field. However, this walkthrough will use the **Trace Opposite - from Line** function.  

### To find all usage of the faulty lot  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the line of the purchase receipt, the last trace line, and then choose **Trace Opposite – from Line**.  

    The trace result is now based on the filters of the trace line for the purchase receipt, LOT1 and item 2000, and the result is based on trace method **Origin - Usage**.  

    To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1, continue to expand all trace lines.  

2.  Choose the **Expand All** action.  

    The first four trace lines refer to the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd., which is already resolved. The last line indicates that one more racing bike, SN2, was produced in the same released production order and then sold and shipped on another sales shipment.  

    The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer, Cannon Group PLC.  

    At the same time, they can see from the last three trace lines that another two items, SN3 and SN4, have been produced based on racing frames from LOT1. They take action to block these end items in inventory.  

    This completes the second defects management task using the **Item Tracing** page for defects management. Since the **Item Tracing** page is based on posted entries only, the quality controller must continue to the **Find entries** page to make sure that LOT1 is not used in non-posted documents.  

## Finding All Records of a Serial/Lot Number

 With the **Item Tracing** page, the quality controller learned that LOT1 contained the faulty racing frames, which vendor supplied them, and in which posted transaction they have been used. They must now determine whether LOT1 is in any open documents by integrating from the trace result to the **Find entries** page where they can perform a search through all database records.  

### To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records, such as open orders  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the first trace line, the purchase receipt of LOT1.  
2.  Choose the **Find entries** action.  

    The **Find entries** page is preset with search filters based on the trace result for LOT1. The quality controller recognizes most of the records as pertaining to documents already identified on the **Item Tracing** page. For example, the last Find Entries line of type Production Order refers to the two released production orders that consumed racing frames from LOT1.  

    However, the second Find Entries line of type **Sales Line** is a non-posted document line, so the quality controller proceeds to investigate.  

3.  To open the sales line record, select the second Find Entries line, choose the **Show** action. Alternatively, choose the value in the **No. of Records** field.  

    Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames. They immediately suggest to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order, based on good racing frames, be initiated.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how to use the **Find entries** page for defects management in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.

Before you can manage fixed assets (FA), you must set up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, and journal templates and batches to post and reclassify fixed assets. Also, define a classification hierarchy (classes and sub classes) to structure your assets and, if needed, define the locations where you store assets.

## To set up general behavior for fixed assets functionality

Define the general behavior of the fixed asset functionality and its document number series on the **Fixed Assets Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To set up fixed asset posting groups

Use posting groups to define groups of fixed assets. Entries for these posting groups post to the same general ledger accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Group Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   To make sure that balancing accounts for different fixed assets postings are automatically inserted when you choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on journal lines, follow the next step, based on appreciation posting.
4. On the **Balancing Account** FastTab, in the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field, select the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation.

For more information about using the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on fixed asset G/L journal lines, see [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).

## To set up fixed asset journal templates

A template is a predefined layout for a journal. The template contains information about trace codes, reports, and number series. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset journal template the first time that you open the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, but you can set up other journal templates.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset class and subclass codes

In fixed assets, you can define a classification hierarchy that can be used to group assets. The hierarchy has two levels: classes and subclasses.

### Fixed asset class codes

Fixed asset classes are the top-level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. For example, use classes to divide assets into tangible or intangible assets. You must create at least one fixed asset class in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Classes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset classes that you want to create.

### Fixed asset subclass codes

Fixed asset subclasses are the second level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. Each subclass points to a top-level class. Use fixed asset subclass codes to group fixed assets in more specific categories, such as buildings, vehicles, furniture, or machinery. You must create at least one fixed asset subclass in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Subclasses**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset subclasses that you want to create.

## Start to register assets

If you're using the fixed assets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, you must set up the general ledger application area before you set up fixed assets. How you do so depends on whether you integrate fixed assets with the general ledger.  

The following procedure is used if fixed asset transactions are to be posted to the general ledger.  

1. Complete the basic setups for fixed assets.  
2. Fill in a fixed asset card for each existing asset.  
3. Create a fixed asset depreciation book for each depreciation purpose (such as tax and financial statements). For each depreciation book, define the terms and conditions, such as integration with the general ledger.

    Enable general ledger integration by following the next steps. First, ensure that general ledger integration isn't enabled for all depreciation books, then post the opening entries, and finally, turn on general ledger integration.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **Depreciation Book Card** page.
6. On the **Integration** FastTab, turn off all of the toggles. If you have more than one depreciation book, repeat this step for each one.  
7. In the fixed asset journal, enter the following lines for each asset:
   * A line with the acquisition cost.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation to the end of the previous fiscal year.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation from the start of the current fiscal year to the date that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set to start calculating the depreciation.

    If you have other opening balances you can also enter them now, such as write-down and appreciation.  
8. After you enter and post the journal lines for each asset, turn on general ledger integration in the
depreciation books.

If the fixed assets aren't integrated with the general ledger, skip steps six and eight.

## To set up fixed asset location codes (optional)

Fixed asset location codes define identifiers for where assets can be located, such as sales department, reception, administration, production, or warehouse. You can use them to register the location of a fixed asset. This information is useful for insurance and inventory purposes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset locations that you want to create.

## To set up fixed asset allocation keys (optional)

Use allocation keys to allocate transactions to various departments or projects. For example, you can set up an allocation key to allocate vehicle depreciation costs with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department. For more information, see [Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md).

Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes, not to individual assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **FA Posting Groups** page, choose the **Allocations** action, and then choose a posting type.
3. On the **FA Allocations** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each posting type that you want to define allocation keys for.

## To set up fixed asset journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each journal template. For example, employees can have their own journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal templates (optional)

Use dedicated reclassification journals to transfer, split, or combine fixed assets. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset reclassification journal template the first time you open the **FA Reclass. Journal** page, but you can set up other reclassification journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each reclassification journal template. For example, employees can have their own reclassification journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the reclassification journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Reclass. Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

# Design Details: Integration with Inventory

Warehouse management and inventory features interact with one another in physical inventory and in inventory or warehouse adjustment.  

## Physical inventory  

The **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page is used with the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page for all advanced warehouse locations. The inventory on bin level is calculated, and a printed list is provided for the warehouse employee. The list shows which items in which bins must be counted.  
  
The warehouse employee enters the counted quantity on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page and then posts the journal.  
  
If the counted quantity is greater than the quantity on the journal line, a movement is posted for this difference from the default adjustment bin to the counted bin. This increases the quantity in the counted bin and decreases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
If the quantity counted is less than the quantity on the journal line, a movement for this difference is posted from the counted bin to the default adjustment bin. This decreases the quantity in the counted bin and increases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
In advanced warehouse configurations, the value in the **Quantity (Calculated)** field is retrieved from item ledger entries and the value in the **Quantity (Phys. Inventory)** field is retrieved from warehouse entries, excluding the adjustment bin content. The **Quantity** field specifies the difference between the first two fields, which should be equal to the contents of the adjustment bin.  
  
When you post the physical inventory journal, the inventory and the default adjustment bin are updated.  

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]
  
## Warehouse adjustments to the item ledger  

You use the **Item Journal** page and the **Calculate Whse. Adjustment** function to adjust inventory on the item ledger in accordance with an adjustment that has been made to the item quantity in a warehouse bin. To create a link between the inventory and the warehouse, you must define a default adjustment bin per location.  
  
The default adjustment bin registers items in the warehouse when you post an increase for the inventory. However, if you post a decrease, the quantity on the default bin is also decreased. In both cases, item ledger entries and warehouse entries are created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Inventory calculations don't include the adjustment bin.  
  
To adjust the bin content, use a warehouse item journal, where you can enter the item number, zone code, bin code, and quantity to adjust.  
  
If you enter a positive quantity and post the line, then the inventory stored in the bin increases, and the quantity of the default adjustment bin decreases correspondingly.

# Find Your Warehouse Assignments

To find your warehouse assignments, open the card page for a selected item. If warehouse instructions have been created, Take and Place lines are visible, and you can begin working on an assignment. In some warehouses, the manager may have assigned specific instructions to each employee. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).

## To find an instruction assigned to you

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, **Warehouse Picks**, or **Warehouse Movement**, and then choose the related link.

    All three pages show assignments for all warehouse locations.  

2. Sort the items by location. You can now see the instructions that have been assigned to you.  
3. Select one of the lines with your initials in the **Assigned User ID** field and then choose the **OK** button. The put-away assignment then appears on the page, with your initials in the **Assigned User ID** field on the **General** FastTab.  

You can use the **Assigned User ID** field on the header to claim work assignments, if the warehouse manager does not assign particular instructions to individuals. Simply enter your user ID in the header of the warehouse before you begin work on an instruction. Your co-workers can then choose to work on other instructions, and the warehouse will avoid a duplication of effort.

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-80.00|-10|2|  

### Value Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|2|3|  

### Item Application Entries (2)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|2|2|1|2|-10|  

At the end of the accounting period, you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to reconcile these inventory transactions with the general ledger.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

 The following tables show the result of reconciling the inventory transactions in this example with the general ledger.  

### Value Entries (3)  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|10.00|1|2|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|-80.00|2|3|  

### General Ledger Entries (3)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|70.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-70.00|2|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|3|  
|01-01-07|[Overhead Applied Account]|7292|-10.00|4|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-80.00|5|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|80.00|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The posting date of the general ledger entries is the same as for the related value entries.  
> 
> The **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the **Value Entry** table is filled.  

 The relation between value entries and general ledger entries is stored in the **G/L - Item Ledger Relation** table.  

### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation table (3)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  
|5|3|1|  
|6|3|1|  

## Assembly and Production Posting

Capacity and resource ledger entries represent the time that is posted as consumed in production or assembly. These process costs are posted as value entries to the general ledger along with the involved material costs in a similar structure as described for item ledger entries in this topic.  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).

# Record consumption or usage for projects

From the **Project Card** page, you can open the **Project Planning Lines** page to review and record use on various parts of your project. This information is automatically updated when you modify and transfer information between projects and project journals or project invoices. This requires that you turn on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Project Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

For example, for planning lines of type **Budget**, you can enter the quantity of a resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to the project journal. If the type of the planning line is **Billable**, you can enter the quantity of the resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to an invoice. To learn more about invoicing the customer, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md). By comparing the original quantity, remaining quantity, or posted quantity you can quickly review use information. To learn more about how to estimate budgeted values during planning, go to [Manage Project Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).  

The following procedures describe how to record actual (budgeted) quantities and costs with a project journal. Alternatively, you can use purchase documents to record purchases for a project. Learn more at [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md).

## To record usage for a project planning line of type Budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. 
3. Select a project planning line of type **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable** for which you want to record usage.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also record usage for a project planning line of type **Billable**. Typically, you use these lines to create invoices, but you can also transfer the information to a journal. Learn more at [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) 

4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** field, enter the quantity to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the project and transfer to the journal.
5. Choose the **Create Project Journal Lines** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more project planning lines for this project, wait with this step until you have added all project planning lines.
6. On the **Project Transfer Project Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **Open Project Journal** action.  
8. On the **Project Journal** page, select the relevant line and then choose the **Post** action.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

9. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, review the recorded usage by observing the **Quantity**, **Remaining Quantity**, and **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** fields.  
10. Repeat steps 3 through 8 to record additional usage.  

## To create project journal lines manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose a relevant project journal batch.  
3. On a new line, enter document number, project number, project task number, type, and the quantity of the type being consumed.  
4. When the project journal lines are complete, choose the **Post** action.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view project usage estimates and post updates

You can view project usage up to the completion of a project in one step. To do so, you use the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** batch job for all the tasks up to and including the end of a project.  

This lets you track and compare your original estimates against actual results and make modifications or new entries as needed. For example, you may have estimated that a project required 10 hours, and to date, it has taken 15 hours. You can add the extra five hours to the existing journal line or create a new journal line to report these five hours as overtime, which is another work type. The appropriate cost and price are calculated, and you can then post to the journal.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries create item ledger entries and reduce the inventory quantity. The **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job transfers the cost from inventory to the general ledger. Resource entries create resource ledger entries.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
3. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, enter the document number and posting date that is to be inserted in the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. Update the journal with any modifications that may be needed.  
5. Choose the **Post**.

## Create inventory and warehouse pick documents for a project

Use the **Create Inventory Pick** and **Create Warehouse Pick** actions on the **Project Card** page. To create or register a pick document, use the **Put-away/Pick Lines/Movement Lines** or **Registered Pick Lines** actions. Learn more at [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Projects](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can use the actions under the following conditions:

* The **Status** of the project is **Open**.
* The **Line Type** of the project planning line is **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable**.
* The **Type** of the project planning line is **Item**.
* **Require Pick** is enabled for the related location.
* **Directed Pick and Put-away** is disabled.

> [!NOTE] 
> Although the setting is called **Require Pick**, you can still post consumption directly from the project journal line for the location. If your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to organize and print the picking information. You also use the page to enter and post the result of the pick, which in turn posts the consumption of the items. 
> 
> If your location is set up to require both pick and shipment processing, meaning that you have chosen both the **Require Pick** and **Require Shipment** fields on the **Location Card** page, use the **Warehouse Pick** page to handle the pick. Warehouse picks are similar to inventory picks. The difference is that rather than posting the picking information you register the pick. This registration doesn't post consumption, it just makes the items available for posting. As a warehouse manager, you can use a pick worksheet to organize pick information before creating the individual warehouse pick instructions

## To review planning lines for a project ledger entry

After you have posted project journal lines, you can see the planning lines that are associated with the project journal entries that have been posted.

> [!NOTE]  
> This requires that the **Apply Usage Link** check box has been selected for the project. For more information, see [Set up projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, choose **Show Linked Project Planning Lines** action.

# Sandbox Environments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can easily get a safe environment where you can test, train, or troubleshoot without disturbing your company's work processes or business data. Such a non-production environment is called a *sandbox*. Isolated from production, a sandbox environment is the place to safely explore, learn, demo, develop, and test the service without the risk of affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

> [!TIP]
> Did you land on this article after you chose the name of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the top bar? Currently, you cannot change the name or the environment that way. Instead, you must ask your admin to change the name, or ask them to share the link to another environment.

Your administrator manages sandbox environments in the [administration center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  

For example, if you want to create a sandbox for benchmarking, your administrator can create a dedicated environment in the administration center. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the developer and administration content.  

You can also safely use sandboxes for training, such as for following a learning path from [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), because it's a safe environment to experiment with. If anything goes wrong, you just delete the sandbox and start over.  

Once you're done, you can remove the sandbox, using the administration center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, sandbox environments are very different from production environments. Your administrator can create a sandbox that includes production data, but it is still a sandbox, and you cannot request a database export, for example. For more information, see [Sandbox environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types#sandbox-environments) in the developer and administration content.

The sandbox environment is not least useful because it includes a couple of handy features:

* [Advanced user experience](#advanced-user-experience)  
<!--* [Complete sample data](#complete-sample-data)  -->
* [Designer](#designer)  

## Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox tenant by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: menu.  

After you have enabled the *Premium* user experience, you get access to all the standard profiles (roles) and Role Centers in the standard version. Alternatively, contact a reselling partner for a demonstration of the capabilities. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.yml#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

### Complete sample data

For situations where you need additional sample data, please talk to your reselling partner.
<!-- In the sandbox environment, you can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option so that you can take training or step through walkthroughs that require additional sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing.md).   -->

<!--#### To create a company with complete sample data in a sandbox

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create New Company**.  
3. In the **Assisted Setup for Creating a Company** page, choose **Next**.  
4. Specify a name for the new company, and then, in the **Select the data and setup to get started** field, choose **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**.  
5. Complete the rest of the assisted setup guide.  

When the assisted setup guide completes, you can start exploring the new company with the complete sample data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  -->

## Designer

In a sandbox environment, you will find the **Designer** enabled. You can activate Designer by selecting the design icon ![Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-design-icon.png) on a page, or by choosing the **Design** menu item in the ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) Settings menu.  

For more information, see [Use Designer](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inclient-designer) in the developer and admin content (in English only).  

<!-- ![In-client Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-designer.png) -->

# Finding Related Entries for Documents

Learn how to find documents and entries that are related to each other based on a piece of common information, like:

- Document number or posting date.
- Business contact type, number, or external document number.
- Item serial number or lot number.

This feature is useful for finding the ledger entries that resulted from certain transactions. When you search by document number, you can print the summary from the **Document Entries** report.

## Get started

The find entries feature is readily available from almost any page by pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> keys. From pages that specifically display posted documents or posted document entries&mdash;for both lists and cards&mdash;you can also open the feature by choosing the **Find entries** action.

The **Find Entries** page includes all related documents and entries based on the document no. and posting date. The page is divided into three sections:

- The top section displays fields and actions that you use for filtering your search.
- The middle section displays related documents based on the search.
- The bottom section displays information about the source document that was found by searching.

## Search for entries

You can search for entries based on information about either the document, business contact, or item reference. On the top section, select one of the following options based on the type of information you have:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
| **Search for documents** | View entries based on a specific document number or posting date. |
| **Search for business contacts** | View entries based on a specific contact type, contact number, and/or external document number. This last option allows you to search for vendor or customer documents by using the number assigned by the contact. |
| **Search for item references** | View entries based on a serial number or lot number. You can enter the lot number or serial number, or filter on the lot number or serial number that you want to search for. This action is useful to see where a specific item tracking number was used, what vendor it came from, or what customer it was sold to. |

After you make a selection, enter the relevant search information in the fields at the top of the page. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] When you're finished, choose **Find** to start the search. If you change any of the filters, you have to choose **Find** again.

> [!TIP]
> For a couple of examples about using **Find Entries**, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md) and [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).

title: Update Custom Report Layouts
description: Learn how to update a custom report layout used on a report when there are design changes to the report's data set, for example.

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features a **Service Tasks** page that gives an overview of all the service items that need attention. Think of it as your service dashboard where you can see what orders are pending, look for and register spare parts, and keep your inventory up-to-date.  

To track changes and get a graphical view of your service business, use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] statistics tools for quick, automatically generated charting and analysis.  

## To work on a service task  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. Select the service task you want to work on. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action. The **Service Item Worksheet** page opens.  
6. Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
7. In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.  

## To register service operations  
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent. The data you specify is stored on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can update the data when necessary.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to register the service for, and choose the item line.  
3. Choose the **Service Item Worksheet** action  
4. On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  

## To register spare parts  
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to use spare parts for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the spare parts you use on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the relevant spare part.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of items you want to use.  

 You can use a similar procedure to register the spare parts on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the **Service Order** page.  

## To register spare parts from a service order  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order you want to register spare parts for.  
3. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. enter a new service line.  

## To replace a service item or a service item component  
When you service a service item that is composed of components, you may need to replace a faulty component with a new one. Every time that you enter a spare part for a service item with components, you have the option of replacing a component or creating a new one. The new item is not registered as a component of the service item until you post this service line or the service order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the component to replace.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens with three options: **Replace Component**, **New Component**, and **Ignore**. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option | Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Replace Component**|Changes the status of the component you are replacing to not active, and it will appear on the replaced component list for the service item.|  
    |**New Component**|Enters the new component in the component list of the service item.|  
    |**Ignore**|Does nothing to the component list of the service item.|  

7. Choose **Replace Component**.  
8. Choose the component to replace, and then choose **OK**.  

## To change the response time for a service item line  
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, depending on whether the service item is on a service contract the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order or quote to open the card.  
3. On the service item line you want to change the response time for, either in the **Response Time (Hours)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.  

## To register fault/resolution codes  
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault/resolution codes relationships. The fault and resolution codes will appear in the corresponding fields on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can also register the codes directly in this page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Service Item Worksheet** page, choose **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault/Resolution Codes Relationships** page opens.  

  >  [!NOTE]
  >  Filters are set on the relationships that are shown on the page by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

4. Fill out the line. Choose the combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose **OK** to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination on the page.

# Set up prepayments

You use prepayments when:

* You require your customers to submit payment before you ship an order to them.
* Your vendor requires that you submit payment before they ship an order to you.

Prepayments let you invoice and collect deposits from customers or to remit deposits to vendors, to ensure that all partial payments are posted against an invoice. For more information, see [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).

Before you can post prepayment invoices, you have to set up the posting accounts in the general ledger, and you have to set up number series for prepayment documents. You must specify an account for prepayments related to sales and an account for prepayments related to purchasing. You can specify the same posting accounts for all prepayments related to all general business posting groups or general product posting groups. You can also specify specific accounts for specific posting groups for sales and purchasing, respectively. The best method to use depends on your company's requirements for tracking prepayments.  

You can define the percentage of the line amount to invoice for prepayment for a customer or vendor, and for all or selected items. After you complete the setup, you can generate prepayment invoices from sales and purchase orders. You can use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or you can change the amounts on the invoice as needed. For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you do not use a prepayment percentage of 100 in the following cases:
>
> * If you are located in North America. Due to how taxes are calculated, a prepayment percentage of 100 can lead to issues with prepayment invoices.
> * In all regions, if you manually deduct a payment discount from the invoice. A prepayment percentage of 100 will not automatically leave an amount from which to deduct the discount.
>
> Also, when you're using prepayment percentage of 100, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might need to create off-setting rounding entries. When that happens, you will need to choose a G/L account in the **Invoice Rounding Account** field on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. This is true even if you have not turned on the **Invoice Rounding** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. If you do not specify an account you you will not be able to post prepayment invoices.

The prepaid amount belongs to the buyer until they receive the goods or services. You must set up general ledger accounts to hold the prepayment amounts until you post the final invoice. Sales prepayments must be recorded in an account for liabilities until the items ship. Purchase prepayments must be recorded in an account for assets until the items are received. In addition, you must set up a separate general ledger account for each VAT identifier.  

[!INCLUDE[local-func-setup-link](includes/local-func-setup-link.md)]

## To add prepayment accounts to the general posting setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, for the relevant lines, fill in the following fields:  

    * **Sales Prepayments Account**  
    * **Purch. Prepayments Account**  

If you don't already have general ledger accounts for prepayments, you can open the **G/L Account List** page from the relevant account field.  

## To set up number series for prepayment documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:  

   * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
   * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:

    * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
    * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the same number series for prepayment invoices and regular invoices, or you can use different number series. If you use different series, they must not overlap because there must not be any numbers that exist in both series.  

## To set up prepayment percentages for items, customers, and vendors

For an item, you can set up a default prepayment percentage for all customers, a specific customer, or a customer price group. If you don't want to apply the same prepayment percentage to all customers, you must specify which customers or which customer price groups the prepayment percentage applies to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an item, and then choose the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For a customer or vendor, you can set up one default prepayment percentage for all items and all types of sales lines. You enter the percentage on the customer or vendor card. The following procedure shows how to specify a prepayment percentage for a customer, but similar steps apply to vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a customer.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, fill in the **Prepayment %** field.
4. Repeat the steps for other customers or for vendors.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page from the customer or vendor card.

### To determine which prepayment percentage has first priority  

An order might have a prepayment percentage on the sales header, and a different percentage for the items on the lines. To determine which prepayment percentage applies to each sale line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for and applies the first default percentage in the following order:  

1. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer that the order is for.  
2. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer price group that the customer belongs to.  
3. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line for all customers.  
4. The prepayment percentage on the sales or purchase header.  

In other words, the prepayment percentage on the customer card only applies if no prepayment percentage is set for the item. However, if you change the contents of the **Prepayment Percentage** field on the sales or purchase header after you create the lines, the prepayment percentage on all of the lines update. The update makes it easy to create an order with a fixed prepayment percentage, regardless of the percentage set on items.

## To automatically release sales orders when prepayments are applied

You can save time by setting up a job queue entry that will automatically release sales orders that require prepayment after payments are applied. Automating the process saves you the step of releasing the sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Prepmt. Auto Update Frequency** field, specify how often you want the job queue entry to run.

> [!TIP]
> While you're here, consider adding a safeguard against shipping or invoicing sales orders that have unpaid premayment amounts. If you turn on the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will prevent people from posting orders with outstanding prepayment amounts.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
4. Set up the **Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** job queue entry, for example, by using the settings on the **Recurrence** FastTab to schedule how often you want it to run. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices, to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** check box.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

The status of the price list must be **Draft**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  
  
---

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter adjustment in **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** field.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected **Item**.  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them in the **Sales Prices** table, you can use the **Implement Price Changes** batch job, which is found on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

# Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer, you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract.  
  
By handling a service item under multiple contracts, you can do the following:  
  
* Issue different contracts for the same service item.  
* Service parts separately.  
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item, such as mechanical components and software.  
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item.  
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods.  
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order.  
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements.  
  
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality.  
  
## Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item  
You can manually create a service contract or contract quote for service items already registered in non-canceled contracts owned by the same customer. To do this, follow the standard procedure of creating service contracts and service contract quotes. For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md).  
  
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes, a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes. If you confirm this message, all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line.  
  
## Copying Documents  
You can automatically create a service contract or contract quote for service items that are already registered in other service contracts or contract quotes by using the **Copy from Document** action.  
  
## Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts  
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts. A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired.

# Introduction to Microsoft Fabric and Business Central

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] is an end-to-end analytics solution with full-service capabilities including data movement, data lakes, data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence&mdash;all backed by a shared platform providing robust data security, governance, and compliance. Your organization no longer needs to stitch together individual analytics services from multiple vendors. Instead, use a streamlined solution that’s easy to connect, onboard, and operate.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Microsoft Fabric release plan, see [aka.ms/FabricRoadmap](https://aka.ms/FabricRoadmap)
> 
> The regular publishing of this roadmap will help you stay informed about how [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] will address your needs.

## Where does [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] fit into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] analytics

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many out-of-the-box reports and data analysis capabilities such as financial reporting, open in Excel, and analysis mode on lists and queries. On top of this, it's easy to define Power BI reports that read data from standard and custom APIs, define Power BI metrics scorecards, and embed all of these directly in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. But for customers with more advanced data science or business intelligence scenarios that require richer data engineering or data integration, [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] might be a good option. 

## OneLake

A key part of [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] offering is OneLake. OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. You can think of OneLake as the OneDrive for data. It provides you with data lake as a service without having to build it yourself. OneLake comes automatically with every [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] tenant with no infrastructure to manage. All the data, which lands in OneLake, automatically takes part in out-of-the-box data governance such as data lineage, data protection, certification, and catalog integration. It breaks down data silos by enabling different parts of the organization to work independently while still contributing to the same data lake.

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] items store your data in OneLake in an open file format. For structured tabular data, this format is *delta parquet*. Delta parquet format allows every analytics engine in [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] to access the data from other analytics engines. This way, it allows flexibility for data practitioners to use the tools of your choice.

# Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts

You can rate a prospect so you can identify the ideal prospects to focus your sales campaign on. You can set up profile questionnaires that you want to use when entering information about your contacts' profiles. Within each questionnaire, you can set up the different questions you intend to ask your contacts. This way, you can group contacts so that your campaigns are more likely to target the right people based on the criteria that you define with the questionnaires.  

With the right questionnaires, you can rate your prospects and group them into categories. You can use existing questions and answers and combine them with new questions and answers to form the basis of your rating. Each answer in the rating is given a point value and, depending on the range you set up for the categories (*From Value* and *To Value*), the rating system will group your contacts in the categories you have defined. For example, *ABC* customers, *High/Low loyalty* vendors, or *Platinum/Gold/Silver* prospects.  

You can also run the questionnaire to answer some of the questions based on contact, customer, or vendor data automatically.  

## To add a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Questionnaire Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** Action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To add questions to a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the relevant profile questionnaire, and then choose the **Edit Questionnaire Setup** action.  
2. On the first empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Question** and type your question in the **Description** field. Fill in the other fields on this line.  

    Optionally, add details to the question.

    1. Choose the line with the question, and then, choose the **Line** menu, and then choose **Question Details**.  

    2. On the **Classification** FastTab in the **Profile Question Details** page, select the **Auto Contact Classification** field.  

    3. In the **Contact Class. Field** field, select the **Rating** option.  

    4. Fill in the **Min. % Questions Answered** field. The default is **0**.  

        This specifies the number of questions in percentage that must be answered for this rating to be calculated.

    5. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Page** group, choose **Answer Points**. Enter the points you want to give each answer listed in the **Answer Points** page.

        If you want to get an overview of the points you have given each answer, choose the **Answer Points** action.

    6. To run an update, return to the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page. On the **Actions** menu, in the **Functions** group, choose **Update Classification**.

    In the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page, the number of contacts that meets this criteria is displayed in the **No. of Contacts** field, as well as on the **Contact Card** of each contact.

3. On the next empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Answer** and type your answer in the **Description** field.  
4. In the **Priority** field, select the priority. In the **From Value** and **To Value** fields, define a point range. Contacts that receive points within the defined range will get the answer.  

Repeat these steps to enter all the questions and answers within the profile questionnaire.

After you have created a questionnaire, you can use it to rate and classify your contacts. You can also set up questions that are rated automatically based on information in the contact card.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you enter a question that is automatically answered, choose **Line**, and then choose **Question Details**, to enter the criteria to automatically answer the question.

## Apply questionnaires to contacts

You can apply your questionnaires to contacts manually. Just open the relevant contact card, and then choose the **Profile** action. Then, once you have applied the questionnaires that you want to apply, you can start using the categories in your campaigns.  

## The Automatic Classification of Contacts

You can automatically classify your contacts according to customer, vendor, and contact information, by setting up automatically answered profile questions on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts that are recorded as customers can be assigned a classification based on customer data and only contacts that are recorded as vendors can be assigned a classification based on vendor data. The automatic classification is not updated automatically. Consequently, you may want to update the profile questionnaires, after you have updated the customer, vendor or contact data they are based on.  

After you have set up automatically answered profile questions, if you assign the profile questionnaire containing these questions to a contact, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically assign the right answers for the contact.  

## Example

You can classify your contacts according to how much they bought from you:

|Answer|Applies to|
|--- |--- |
|A|contacts who bought for 500,000 LCY or more|
|B|contacts who bought for 100,000 up to 499,999 LCY|
|C|contacts who bought for 99,999 LCY or less|

To do this, fill on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page as follows:

| Type     | Description        | Automatic Classification     | From Value | To Value |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Question | ABC Classification | Click to insert a check mark |            |          |
| Answer   | A                  |                              | 500,000    |          |
| Answer   | B                  |                              | 100,000    | 499,999  |
| Answer   | C                  |                              |            | 99,999   |

Then fill on the **Profile Question Details** page as follows:

| Field                         | Value         |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Customer Classification Field | Sales (LCY)   |
| Classification Method         | Defined Value |

When you assign the profile questionnaire containing this question to a contact, application automatically enters the relevant answer for this contact on the profile lines of the contact card.

## Customer Table

**Customer Measures**

- [No. of Customers](#no-of-customers)
- [No. of Lost Customers](#no-of-lost-customers)
- [No. of New Customers](#no-of-new-customers)
- [No. of Recovered Customers](#no-of-recovered-customers)
- [No. of Returning Customers](#no-of-returning-customers)

- [Sales New Customers](#sales-new-customers)
- [Sales Recovered Customers](#sales-recovered-customers)
- [Sales Returning Customers](#sales-returning-customers)

### No. of Customers

**Formula**  

Distinct count of the **Customer No.** column from the **Sales** table.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Lost Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were "lost" (stopped purchasing) within the current date selection. It determines the latest date in the selection, prepares a table of customers and their associated "lost" dates, and then filters out the customers whose lost date is within the selected date range. Finally, it counts the rows in this filtered table to get the number of lost customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure counts new customers by finding the date of their first purchase. It includes customers if their first purchase happened within the date selection.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were temporarily "lost" (stopped purchasing) but later made a new purchase. It identifies customers who had a "lost" date before the selected date range, then determines which customers made a new purchase within the current period. The measure filters and counts only those customers whose new purchase occurred after their lost date, returning the total number of recovered customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who made a repeat purchase during the current period. It identifies existing customers by filtering customers whose first purchase was before the selected date range, then determines which of these customers made another purchase within the current period. The measure returns the count of these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Lost Customers (12M)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales lost over the past 12 months due to customers who stopped purchasing ("lost" customers). It first identifies the most recent "lost" date, then filters customers who were lost before that date. It gets the sales from the previous 12 months for these lost customers and calculates the total revenue they generated before they stopped purchasing.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales from customers who made their first purchase within the current date range. It identifies each customer's first purchase date, filters out customers whose first purchase occurred during the selected period, and then sums the sales amount from those new customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by recovered customers. Recovered customers were previously lost but made a purchase afterward. It identifies temporarily lost customers, checks whether they made a new purchase in the current period, and then sums the sales figures for them.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by returning customers. Returning customers are customers who made their first purchase before the current period and made more purchases in the current period. It identifies returning customers by finding the intersection of active customers and customers who purchased previously, and then sums the sales from these returning customers.

- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

### Sales Amount PP (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure determines the appropriate sales amount based on the current context of the date hierarchy in the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to evaluate whether the context is at the fiscal month, fiscal quarter, or fiscal year level. Depending on which level is active, it returns the corresponding sales amount, which is either:

- Previous month (Sales Amount PM (Fiscal))
- Previous quarter (Sales Amount PQ (Fiscal))
- Previous year (Sales Amount PY (Fiscal))

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

### Sales Amount POP (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the change in sales between the current period and the previous period based on the context of the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to determine the appropriate previous period calculation depending on whether the current context is at the fiscal month, quarter, or year level. When at the fiscal month level, it references the month-over-month change from the Sales Amount MOM (Fiscal) measure, which computes the difference between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales. Similarly, for fiscal quarters and years, it uses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year calculations, respectively.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

# Reservation Entry table - Introduction

This technical whitepaper provides guidance to help you understand and troubleshoot data inconsistency issues in the *Reservation Entry* table (Table 337) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The first part introduces the features that generate or modify data in this table. It also covers several fields in the *Reservation Entry* table that are worth pointing out with these features. The second part demonstrates through examples how entries in the *Reservation Entry* table are generated, deleted, or modified when transfer orders are processed or planning features are executed.

The *Reservation Entry* table handles and stores reservation, item tracking, and order tracking information.

When handling item tracking with partial posting, the table works with the *Tracking Specification* table (Table 336). Data entered in the **Item Tracking Lines** page by the user is created in a temporary version of Table 336 and is committed to Table 337 and the tracking specification table when the page is closed.

In general terms, the data generated in the *Reservation Entry* table depends on which features you use and which parameters you selected on the item card. These include:

- Order Tracking policy
- Reservation policy
- Planning features executed
- Reordering and manufacturing policy
- Planning parameters on the item or stock-keeping unit card
- Item Tracking Code

## Features that update the Reservation Entry table

### Order Tracking policy

If the **Order Tracking Policy** field on an item is set to None, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will never create reservation entries in the *Reservation Entry* table, unless the Net Change Plan or Regenerative Plan, Reservation, or Item Tracking is executed. Additionally, without order tracking enabled, you can have reservation entries when using the Manufacturing-to-Order or Assembly-to-Order policies.

You can consider setting the **Order Tracking Policy** to None if you won't require tracking on the fly a demand against a supply or vice versa. The tracking of supply against demand is handled by the order tracking functionality or the planning engine. We don't recommend that you use order tracking together with planning functionality.

When you set the **Order Tracking Policy** field to Tracking Only, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always create entries in table 337 whenever an order is created for the item, but the **Reservation Status** in table 337 isn't always strictly set to Tracking. Consider the following scenario:

> [!NOTE]  
> The work date is set as 01/23/2014 (MM/DD/YYYY) for all examples. 
  
1. Create an item with **Order Tracking Policy** field set to Tracking Only.  
1. Create a purchase order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a reservation entry with the **Reservation Status** of Surplus, since the purchase order isn't yet allocated to a demand.
1. Create a sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will now create another reservation entry with a **Reservation Status** of Tracking.

The **Reservation Status** created in step 2 will be updated to Tracking; this is handled by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically. This concept is called Dynamic Tracking.
By setting the **Order Tracking Policy** field on the item to Tracking Only, an end user can make use of the order tracking feature to get an overview of which supply the demand is allocated to and vice versa.

> [!NOTE]  
> Tracking functionality does not replace planning functionality, which considers all items, demands, and supplies together to provide the optimal planning proposals to optimize customer service levels and balance inventory levels.

### Reservation policy

A reservation consists of a pair of records in the *Reservation Entry* table with a **Reservation Status** of Reservation, which shares the same entry number. One record has the Positive field enabled and points to the supply. The other record has the **Positive** field not enabled and points to the demand. The fields **Source Type**, **Source Ref. No.**, and **Source ID** highlight the reservation link between the demand and supply.

The information in the **Source Type** field is the table the reservation **Entry No.** field is related to. For example, if it's a demand (negative) entry, then it could be the *Sales Order* table (Table 37) or the *Planning Component* (Table 99000829).

The **Source ID** field contains the ID of the document in the table referenced by the Source Type.

The **Source Ref. No.** field contains a reference number for the line, to which the reservation **Entry No.** is related to. If the entry is related to a sale or purchase line, a journal line, or a requisition line, information in this field is copied from the **Line No.** field. If it's related to an entry in the *Item Ledger Entry* table (Table 32), information in this field is copied from the **Entry No.** field of the *Item Ledger Entry* table.

When you use the reservation policy option Always in combination with order tracking, both are normally in sync. However, when the reservation is removed or the receipt date of supply is moved forward past the demand due date, the order tracking will be removed. You can also encounter an error message, in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks what to do with existing reservations. This scenario is illustrated in the following example:

1. Create a new item called COMP. Set the following fields:
  - **Replenishment System**: Purchase
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
  - **Reserve**: Always
2. Create a second item called FG. Set the following fields:
  - **Replenishment System**: Prod. Order
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
  - **Reserve**: Always
3. Create a second item called FG. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: COMP
  - **Quantity Per**: 1
4. Certify the Production BOM No. BOM FG and assign against Item FG.
5. Create a purchase order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: COMP
  - **Quantity**: 10
  - **Location Code**: BLUE
  - **Expected Receipt Date**: 01/24/2014
6. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Shipment Date**: 02/14/2014
  - **Location Code**: BLUE
  - **Item**: COMP
  - **Quantity**: 10

> [!NOTE]  
> Automatic reservation has been executed between the purchase and sales order. Additionally, order tracking has been created between the purchase and sales orders.

7. Create a manual released production order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: 02/14/2014
  - **Quantity**: 10
  - **Location**: BLUE
  - **Due Date**: 02/01/2014
8. On the **Home** tab, in the Process group, choose **Refresh Production Order**.
9. Open the components list and look up Item COMP.

> [!NOTE]  
> No reservation or order tracking is created by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reason is that a reservation already exists against the sales order created in Step 6.

Suppose, due to business reasons, the item is needed more urgently on the released production order created in Step 7. So next, in the following steps we cancel the reservation from the sales order that was created in Step 6 and notice how order tracking is handled.

10. Look up the sales order for Item COMP from Step 6 and cancel the reservation.
11. Open the purchase order from Step 5 and notice that order tracking is now created between the purchase order and the component needed from the released production order.
12. Recreate the reservation between the component needed from the released production order and the supply from the purchase order in Step 5.

> [!NOTE]  
> The reservation is not re-created, which needs to be done manually.

13. Change the **Expected Receipt Date** field on the purchase order header at Step 5 from 01/24/2014 to 02/05/2014.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the following warning message:

   Reservations exist for this Order. These reservations are canceled if a data conflict is caused by this change. Do you want to continue?

14. Choose Yes. Look up the reservation and order tracking entries from the purchase order.

> [!NOTE]  
> The existing reservation is canceled and needs to be recreated manually. The order, however, is dynamic and has been recreated by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to exist between the purchase order and the sales order. The reason is the demand for the released production order (02/01/2014) is before the expected receipt date of the supply.

This concludes the demonstration of the interaction between using automatic reservations and order tracking. The examples also show what happens when you modify due dates and the error message that is triggered when there's a reservation conflict.

### Planning calculated

Planning done using order planning, the requisition worksheet, or the planning worksheet will generate entries in the *Reservation Entry* table with the **Reservation Status** field set to Tracking, Reservation, or Surplus. There should always be a matching pair with the same Entry No. of positive and negative value in the **Quantity (Base)** field when the status is Tracking or Reservation. The **Source Type** field will be the demand type, that is, table 37 for the negative quantity and a planning table, for example, table 246, for the positive quantity. The **Source ID** field will be PLANNING.

In the case of non-allocated supply or demand, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will set the **Reservation Status** field to Surplus. For example, you can have a reservation status of Surplus when the existing inventory is below the safety stock quantity or demand is linked to the forecast.

The *Untracked Planning Element* table (Table 99000855) holds information about untracked quantities displayed when the user does a lookup from the order tracking page to see untracked quantities or chooses a Warning Icon in the planning worksheet. The table contains entries that account for an untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking network.

These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

In the *Reservation Entry* table, as on the Purchase, Transfer and Production orders, there's a **Planning Flexibility** field. This option field defines if the supply represented by these supply orders is considered by the planning system when calculating Action Messages. If the field contains the option Unlimited, then the planning system includes the line when calculating Action Messages. If the field contains the option None, then the line is firm and unchangeable, and the planning system doesn't include the line when calculating Action Messages. The feature is managed in the *Reservation Entry* table by the field with the same name.

### Reordering and manufacturing policy

If a planning feature is executed for an item set with the Reordering Policy set to Order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create entries in the *Reservation Entry* table with the reservation status of type Reservation instead of Tracking.

The **Source Type** and **Source ID** fields will have the equivalent treatment of other reordering policies. However, in the **Binding** field in the *Reservation Entry* table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will enter Order-to-Order.

The **Binding** field is filled in to control supply orders that are bound to specific demand, for example, production orders that are created directly from a sales order. The field displays Order-to-Order when the entry is tied specifically to a demand or a supply (Automatic Reservation). The demand can be related to sales or component needs.

### Item tracking and prospect reservation entry

The Prospect reservation status can be created by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the *Reservation Entry* table when you aren't using any order network entities, that is, Order Tracking. For example, on a consumption journal line you assign Item tracking to the component. However, if the item is already order tracked, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might create more Prospect reservation entries. This is demonstrated in EXAMPLE 2 related to transfer orders in the second part of this document.

When you view or modify the **Item tracking lines** page, the collective contents of the *Tracking Specification* table (Table 336) and *Reservation Entry* table are presented in a temporary version of Table 336. This ensures that historic and active item tracking data is accessed as one.

Reservations fall into two categories: Nonspecific reservations, where lot and serial numbers aren't specified at the time of reservation, and Specific reservations, where you reserve specific lot or serial numbers from inventory.

On a Nonspecific reservation, the **Lot No.** or **Serial No.** field is blank in the **Entry No.** of Table 337 pointing at the demand (for instance, the sale). Because of the structure of the reservation logic in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], when you place a Nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must nevertheless select specific item ledger entries to reserve against.

Since the item ledger entries carry the item tracking information, the reservation indirectly reserves specific lot or serial numbers, even though the user didn't intend this. However, with Late Binding, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still reserves against specific entries, but then uses a reshuffling mechanism in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when posting.

For further information, review the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Technical Whitepapers listed in the Additional Resources at the end of this document.

### Source Subtype, Suppressed Action Msg., Action Message Adjustment, and Disallow Cancellation fields

The **Source Subtype**, **Suppressed Action Msg.**, **Action Message Adjustment**, and **Disallow Cancellation** fields in the *Reservation Entry* table are described in this section. Scenarios are provided to demonstrate the use of the **Suppressed Action Msg.**, **Action Message Adjustment** and **Disallow Cancellation** fields. The **Action Message Adjustment** field is used for the order tracking policy feature Tracking and Action Message. The **Disallow Cancellation** field is used for the Assembly-to-Order feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2013.

#### Source Subtype

The **Source Subtype** field indicates which Source Subtype the reservation entry is related to. If the entry is related to a purchase or sales line, the field is copied from the **Document Type** field on the line. If it is related to a journal line, the field is copied from the **Entry Type** field on the journal line.

#### Suppressed Action Msg.

The **Suppressed Action Msg.** field records when an existing supply has already been partially processed, for example, when a purchase order has already been partially received or a production order has consumptions posted against it.

When Planning is executed, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] marks this field and sets the **Reservation Entry Status** field to **Surplus**. The following example serves as an illustration:

1. Open Item 80001. Set the following fields:
  - **Reordering Policy**: Lot-for-Lot
  - **Reserve**: Optional
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: None
2. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: 80001
  - **Location**: Blank/None
  - **Quantity**: 10
  - **Shipment Date**: 2/15/2014
3. Open the **Requisition Worksheets** and run the **Calculate Plan** batch job for Item 80001.
  - **Starting Date**: 01/23/2014
  - **Ending Date**: 03/01/2014
4. A planning suggestion is given to replenish the quantity of 10 with a new purchase order and **Due Date** 02/15/2014.
5. On the **Actions** tab, in the Functions group, choose **Carry Out Action** Message to create a purchase order with **Expected Receipt Date** 02/15/2014.
6. Open the purchase order from Step 5 and set **Qty. to Receive** to 2 and post only Receipt.
7. Open the sales order from Step 2 and change **Shipment Date** to 02/10/2014.
8. Open the **Requisition Worksheets** and run **Calculate Plan** for Item 80001
  - **Starting Date**: 01/23/2014
  - **Ending Date**: 03/01/2014
9. A planning suggestion is given to replenish quantity of 8 with a new purchase order and **Due Date** 02/10/2014.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

Entry No. 28 in Table 337 has reservation status Tracking to match the existing inventory recorded on Item Ledger Entry 318 for 2 units and the outstanding demand in the Sales Order Table 37. The subsequent Entry No. 29 also has reservation status Tracking and links the remaining quantity of 8 units between the demand in Sales Order Table 37 and the suggested supply in the Requisition Line Table 246.

Entry No. 30 is the existing purchase order is partially received with quantity 2. As a result, the **Reservation Status** field is Surplus, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the **Quantity (Base)** field to *8* (remaining balance) and the **Suppressed Action Msg.** field is enabled.

#### Action Message Adjustment

The **Action Message Adjustment** field displays the change in the supply side of the order tracking that results when you accept the related action messages. A value appears here only when the facilities for both order tracking and action messages are active (Order Tracking policy set to Tracking & Action Msg.). The value is calculated based on the data in the *Action Message Entry* table (Table 99000849). The following example serves as an illustration:
1. Open item 80002. Set the following field:
 - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking and Action Msg.
2. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: 80002
  - **Location**: BLUE
  - **Quantity**: 100
3. Open the **Order Planning** page, and run the **Calculate Plan** batch job.
4. Select the sales order from Step 2 and run the **Make Orders** batch job.
5. On the sales order from Step 2, change the **Quantity** field from 100 to 105.
The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.
6. Entry No. 34 has the field **Action Message Adjustment** in Table 337 enabled for 5 units with reservation status Surplus. As the sales order was increased at Step 5, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created this reservation because more supply is required.
7. Open the **Planning Worksheets** page and on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Get Action Messages**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest increasing the Purchase Order quantity from 100 to 105.

#### Disallow Cancellation

The **Disallow Cancellation** field indicates that the reservation entry represents the link between a sales order line and an assembly order. You can't delete this reservation because it's required to maintain the synchronization that occurs when an item is assembled to order. The following example serves as an illustration:

1. Create a purchase order. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Assembly
  - **Assembly Policy**: Assemble-to-Order
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
2. Create a new item called Assemble COMP. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Purchase
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
3. Open item Assemble FG, and on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Assembly/Production** group, choose **Assembly**, and then choose **Assembly BOM**. On the Assembly BOM, set the following fields:
  - **Type**: Item
  - **No.**: Assemble COMP
  - **Quantity per**: 1
Choose the **OK** button.
4. Open an Item Journal and increase the inventory of Assemble COMP to quantity 10 against location BLUE and post the journal line.
5. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Assemble FG
  - **Location**: BLUE
  - **Quantity**: 1
The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

Entry No. 82 has Reservation Status Surplus as 9 units of the Assemble Comp on inventory and has no demand. Entry No. 84 is tracking reservation entries between the demand on the *Assembly Line* Table 901 and its supply on item ledger entry 346.

Entry No. 86 has Binding Order-to-Order with Reservation Status Reservation. Additionally, the **Disallow Cancellation** field is enabled as the assembly policy is set as Assemble to Order for item Assembly FG. Finally, the **Planning Flexibility** field is set to None, as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't permit the planning logic to delete the reservation.

#### Quantity available to pick and reservations

The **Reserved Pick & Ship Qty.** field in Table 337 exists in versions prior to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2013 controls item availability within a managed warehouse. In any installation of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] warehouse management, item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries. These two entry types contain different information about where items exist and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation to outbound documents. Special functionality exists in the picking algorithm to calculate the quantity that is available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations. The picking algorithm subtracts quantities that are reserved for other outbound documents, quantities on existing pick documents, and quantities that are picked but not yet shipped or consumed. The result is displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field in the **Pick Worksheet** page, where the field is calculated dynamically. The value is also calculated when a user creates warehouse picks directly from outbound documents such as sales orders, production consumption, or outbound transfers.

*Quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements).*

The following example illustrates how the value in the quantity available to pick is calculated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

1. Create a new item called Warehouse Item. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Purchase
  - **Reserve Policy**: Always
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
2. Create a purchase order against vendor 60000. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Warehouse Item
  - **Location**: WHITE
  - **Quantity**: 100
3. Release the purchase order and create the warehouse receipt.
4. Post the warehouse receipt and register the warehouse put-away for quantity 100.
5. Create a second purchase order against vendor 60000. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Warehouse Item
  - **Location**: WHITE
  - **Quantity**: 10
6. Release the purchase order and create the warehouse receipt.
7. Post the warehouse receipt ONLY. Don't register the warehouse put away.
8. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Warehouse Item
  - **Location**: WHITE
  - **Quantity**: 10
Reserved Quantity is automatically set to 10 due to the Reserve policy being set to Always.
9. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Warehouse Item
  - **Location**: WHITE
  - **Quantity**: 100
Reserved Quantity is automatically set to 100 due to the Reserve policy being set to Always.
10. Release the first sales order from Step 8 and create a warehouse shipment.
11. Release the warehouse shipment and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Create Pick**.
The following error message is displayed:
  *Nothing to Handle.*
The reason is that the available quantity to pick is zero. This is calculated as follows:
   Quantity on Inventory = 110
   Quantity available to pick = 100

> [!NOTE]  
> Quantity on put-away or on receive bin is not available to pick.
   
   Total reserved against sales orders is 110
   Quantity available to pick = 100 – 110 = zero.

When the warehouse put-away is registered in Step 7, that enables the creation of the warehouse pick in Step 11. In versions prior to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2013, the Reserved **Pick & Ship Qty.** field in Table 337 is populated against the reservation for quantity 10.

The following illustration is taken from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2009 R2.

## Illustrations using transfer orders and planning

### Transfer orders

When using transfer orders and the item is shipped but not fully received, in the *Reservation Entry* table you get a reservation status Surplus. The location code will be the Transfer-to Location.

The **Source Ref. No.** field is calculated by the last Line Entry Number + Line Entry Number of the Item on the posted Transfer Shipment.

When order tracking is activated and there's no demand (sales order or consumption), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two entries in Table 337 with reservation status Surplus. One is against the *Transfer Line* Table 5741 and the other is against the Item Ledger Entry Table 32.

This is demonstrated in the first example.

#### Example 1

1. Open items 80003 and 80004 and set the field **Tracking Policy** to *Tracking Only*. Leave the other fields as default.
2. Open an Item journal and increase the inventory of these items to quantity 10 each against location RED and post the journal lines.
3. Create a transfer order from location RED to BLUE for these two items: Item 80003 on Transfer Order Line 10000 and Item 80004 on the second line 20000, both for 10 units.
4. Post only the shipment part of the transfer order without any warehouse features.
The posted transfer shipment is shown in the following illustration.
The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.
5. Compare the results on the posted transfer shipment with the entries in Table 337.

The following table describes what happens in certain fields against reservation entry 40.

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Reservation Status**|Surplus as Item 80003 is set up with order tracking but no demand exists.|  
|**Location Code**|Transfer-to code location BLUE.|  
|**Source Type**|Transfer Line Table 5741.|  
|**Source ID**|Document No. of the transfer order 1011.|
|**Source Ref. No.**|Total Line No. 20000 + Line No. 10000 against Item 80003 = 30000.|

The explanation for the following fields against Reservation Entry 43 is as follows.

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Reservation Status**|Surplus as Item 80003 is set up with order tracking but no demand exists.|  
|**Location Code**|In-transit location OWN LOG is the location on which the item exists.|  
|**Source Type**|Item Ledger Entry Table 32.|  
|**Source Ref. No.**|The open Item Ledger Entry number 322.|

#### Example 2

The next example illustrates what happens when a component is transferred between locations, but at the same time is tracked between a demand need and available supply. The components will be transferred from location RED to BLUE, which is to be consumed on a released production order. The component uses Order Tracking, Order Planning, and Item Tracking.

The example highlights the detected flow in Table 337 in relation to the fields **Reservation Status**, **Location Code**, **Source Type**, **Source ID**, **Source Ref. No.**, and type of **Binding**.

1. In the **Manufacturing Setup** page, set field **Components at Location** set to RED.
2. Create a new Item Component. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Purchase
  - **Manufacturing Policy**: Make-to-Stock
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
  - **Item Tracking Code**: LOTALL
3. Using the Item Journal, increase inventory for Item Component against location RED to 100 units. Set the following Lot numbers:
  - Lot number Lot A, Quantity 30
  - Lot number Lot B, Quantity 70
4. Create a new item Produced. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Production
  - **Manufacturing Policy**: Make-to-Stock
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: Tracking Only
5. Create **Production BOM** with 1 quantity per of the Item Component.
6. Assign the Production BOM against Item Produced.
7. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Produced
  - **Location**: BLUE
  - **Quantity**: 100
8. On the **Actions** tab of the sales order, in the **Plan** group, choose **Planning** to create a linked released production order against the sales order.
9. Open the released production order/component need and notice that the location is set as RED.
The reason is that the **Components at Location** is RED on the **Manufacturing Setup** card.
The Item Produced will get the output against location BLUE.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

##### Reservation Entries with numbers 55 and 56

For the component need for Lot A and Lot B, respectively, order tracking links are created from the demand in Table 5407, Prod. Order Component, to the supply in Table 32, Item Ledger Entry. The **Reservation Status** field contains Tracking for all four entries to indicate that these dynamic order tracking links between supply and demand.

The demand in Table 5407, Prod. Order Component is linked to the Source ID of the released production order 101006. The supply in Table 32, Item Ledger Entry, is linked to Source Ref. No. being the Item Ledger Entry numbers 325 and 326 at which the units exist.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Lot No.** field is empty on the demand lines because the lot numbers are not specified on the component lines of the released production order.

##### Reservation Entry with number 57

From the sales demand in Table 37, Sales Line, an order tracking link is created to the supply in Table 5406, Prod. Order Line. The **Reservation Status** field contains Reservation, and the **Binding** field contains Order-to-Order. This is because the released production order was generated specifically for the sales order and must remain linked, unlike order tracking links with reservation status of Tracking, which are created and changed dynamically.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Binding** field can also contain *Order-to-Order* when using Make-to-Order as Manufacturing Policy and/or Order as Reordering Policy.

10. At this point in the scenario, the 100 units of the component are transferred from RED location to BLUE location by using a transfer order.

Select Lot A and Lot B for the shipment.

Post the total outstanding quantity as Shipped ONLY.

> [!NOTE]  
> Components can be consumed at location RED, but for the example to illustrate the flow of reservation entries, the units are transferred manually to location BLUE.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

##### Reservation Entries with number 55 and 56

Order tracking entries for the two lots of the component reflecting demand in Table 5407 are changed from a reservation status of Tracking to Surplus. The reason is that the supplies that they were linked to before, in Table 32, have been used by the shipment of the transfer order. Genuine surplus, as in this case, reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked. It's an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which will generate an action message by the planning system unless it's resolved dynamically.

##### Reservation Entry Numbers 59 to 63

Because the two lots of the component are posted on the transfer order as shipped but not received, all related positive order tracking entries are of reservation type Surplus, indicating that they aren't allocated to any demands. For each lot number, one entry relates to Table 5741, Transfer Line, and one entry relates to the item ledger entry at the in-transit location where the items now exist.

Table 5741, **Transfer Line**, is the Source Type. **Source ID** is the Transfer Order Document Number 1012 and **Source Ref. No.** is 20000 = 10000 + 10000 as detailed in Example 1. The location is set as BLUE for the transfer-to location code.

The remaining two entries with **Reservation Status** Surplus have Table 32, **Item Ledger Entry**, as Source Type and **Source Ref. No.** 328 and 330, including their lot numbers located at present in the In-transit location OUT LOG.

11. Post the outstanding transfer order as Received.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

The order tracking entries are now similar to the first point in the scenario, before the transfer order was posted as shipped only, except entries for the component are now of reservation status Surplus instead of Tracking. This is because the component need is still at RED location, reflecting that the **Location Code** field on the production order component line contains RED as set up in the **Components at Location** setup field.

The supply that was allocated to this demand before had been transferred to the BLUE location and can't now be fully tracked unless the component need on the production order line is changed to the BLUE location. This is recorded in the last two reservation entries with the lot numbers populated, **Source Type** field being Table 32 and **Source Ref. No.** field being Item ledger entries 333 and 334.

12. On the component list assigned to the released production order, change the location to BLUE for the component.

12. Open the **Consumption Journal** and run the **Calc. Consumption** batch job.
Assign Lot A Quantity 30 and Lot B Quantity 70.

Close the Item tracking form.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

##### Reservation Entries with numbers 68 and 69

Since the component need has been changed to BLUE location, and the supply is available as item ledger entries at the BLUE location, all order tracking entries for the two lot numbers are now fully tracked, indicated by the reservation status of Tracking. The lot numbers aren't populated on the **Lot No.** field against the demand on Table 5406, **Prod. Order Line**, as we did not specify lot numbers for the component on the released production order.

##### Reservation Entries with numbers 70 and 71

Entries with reservation status Prospect are generated in Table 337. The reason is that both lot numbers are assigned against the component on the consumption journal, but the journal hasn't been posted.

This completes the section on how order tracking entries in the **Reservation Entry** table are generated, modified, and deleted when using multiple features in combination with transfer orders.

### Planning calculated

When using planning features, that is, the **Requisition Worksheet**, **Planning Worksheet**, or **Order Planning**, then reservation entries on **Reservation Entry** Table 337 might be modified or added depending on the planning suggestion given by the logic in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Example 3 will use **Reordering Policy** Order with **Manufacturing Policy** Make-to Order for a produced Item. The component will use **Reordering Policy** Fixed Reorder Quantity.

#### Example 3

1. In the **Manufacturing Setup** card, **Component at Location** is RED from the previous example.
2. Create new Parent Item 70061. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Prod. Order
  - **Manufacturing Policy**: Make-to-Order
  - **Reordering Policy**: Order
  - **Reserve Policy**: Optional
  - **Order Tracking**: None
3. Create new Component Item 70062. Set the following fields:
  - **Base Unit of Measure**: PCS
  - Any default posting groups
  - **Replenishment System**: Purchase
  - **Reordering Policy**: Fixed Reorder Quantity
  - **Reserve Policy**: Optional
  - **Order Tracking Policy**: None
  - **Safety Stock Quantity**: 10
  - **Reorder Point**: 25
  - **Reorder Quantity**: 50
4. Create a new Production BOM and specify Component Item 70062 with quantity per 1.
Assign the Production BOM to the Parent Item 70061.
5. Create a sales order. Set the following fields:
  - **Item**: Fixed Reorder Quantity
  - **Location**: RED
  - **Quantity**: 40
  - **Shipment Date**: 2/15/2014
6. Open the **Planning Worksheets** page, and run the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** batch job.
  - **MPS/MRP**: enabled
  - **Starting Date**: 01/23/2014
  - **Ending Date**: 03/01/2014
  - Filter on items 70061 and 70062
  - No Forecast

The following planning suggestions are given.

The first planning suggestion is to create a new planned production order to supply the outstanding demand of the sales order for quantity 40 of the Parent Item 70061. Review order tracking and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the outstanding sales order. Order tracking is activated as it is generated by the planning engine.

The second line is to bring the Inventory above Reorder Point (25). So taking into account Reorder Quantity (50), a quantity of 50 units is suggested by the planning logic. The third line is to bring the Inventory to Safety Stock Level (10).

The fourth line is to replenish inventory when the sales order is shipped. At that time, the Inventory is 20 and so below Reorder Point. As a result, the planning engine proposes to purchase 50 additional components taking into account Reorder Quantity. This is Untracked Quantity, so on the *Reservation Entry* Table 337 this will be marked with reservation status Surplus.

The status information in Table 337 is shown in the following illustration.

The **Reservation Status** field is Reservation and an Order-to-Order Binding is created. The reason is that the Item Manufacturing Policy is Make-to-Order and the Reordering Policy is set as Order. If one of the two is set to Order, then the reservation status will be Reservation instead of Tracking and Binding is set to Order-to-Order.

The demand of 40 units against the field **Source ID** is the sales order number 1005 and the Source Type is *Sales Line* Table 37. The reservation entry is aligned with the planning suggestion, Source Ref. No. 10000, Source ID is PLANNING, and Source Type is *Requisition Line* Table 246. So there's a balance between the demand from the sales order and its supply suggested by the planning engine.

##### Reservation Entry numbers 73 and 74

By running the Calculate Plan batch job, the next four entries are generated with a reservation status Tracking due to the setting of the reordering policy Fixed Reorder Quantity for the component. The required supply for component Item 70062 is replenished by the planning suggestions given, Source Ref. No. 20000 and 30000, with Source ID set to PLANNING and Source Type from *Requisition Line* Table 246. The component need is created to fulfill the demand against the Parent Item 70061 for total Quantity (Base) 40. As a result of this demand, the field **Source Prod. Order Line** is 10000, with Source Type the *Component Need* Table 99000829.

The reservation status isn't Surplus, as order tracking exists between the demand of Parent Item 70061 and the supply of Component Item 70062.

##### Reservation Entry numbers 75 and 76

The last two entries have a reservation status Surplus, as these are Untracked Quantities generated on the planning worksheet related to reordering parameters Reorder Point and Reorder Quantity.

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.  

> [!TIP] 
> Verify your mapping by choosing the **Overview** action.  

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"></a>Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, and then fill in the fields, including the API URL and API key provided from Azure Machine Learning studio. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

# Close income statement accounts

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it. To do this, you run the **Close Income Statement** batch job. This job transfers the year's result to an account in the balance sheet and closes the income statement accounts. You do this by creating lines in a journal, which you then can post.

## To run the Close Income Statement batch job

1. Close the fiscal year. The fiscal year must closed before the batch job can be run. For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Close Income Statement**, and then choose the related link.
3. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.

## About the Close Income Statement batch job

The batch job processes all general accounts of the income statement type and creates entries that cancel out their respective balances. That is, each entry is the sum of all the general ledger entries on the account in the fiscal year. These new entries are placed in a journal in which you must specify a balancing account and retained earnings account in the balance sheet before you post. When you post the journal, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and at the same time the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

You must post the journal yourself. The batch job doesn't post the entries automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is being used. When an additional reporting currency is being used, the batch job posts entries directly to the general ledger.

The date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the journal is always a closing date for the fiscal year. The closing date is a fictitious date between the last day of the old fiscal year and the first day of the new year. The advantage of posting on a closing date is that you maintain the correct balances for the ordinary dates of the fiscal year.

The **Close Income Statement** batch job can be used several times. You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the batch job again.

# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Business Central starting from **2024 release wave 1**.  

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals or purchase documents, and recalculation of emissions to CO2 equivalent. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints; calculation using formulas are available for use only when using sustainability journals.   

> [!NOTE]
> This solution is still in early stages of development and new set of features will be added with the next release.  

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Record emission data directly working with purchase documents.
- Record purchase of carbon credit using purchase documents.
- Calculate internal carbon fee.
- Recalculate emission of all gasses to CO2 equivalent using formulas.
- Post emission entries (and carbon credits) to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions.
- Set scorecards and goals and compare them with baseline and targeted values.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
- Use financial reports for cross functional reporting.

# Register new customers

Customers are your source of income. You must register each customer you sell to as a customer card. Customer cards contain the information required to sell products to the customer. Learn more at [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

Before you can register new customers, you must set up various sales codes to choose from when you fill in customer cards. Learn more at [Setting Up Sales](sales-setup-sales.md).

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

## Add new customers

You can add new customers manually by filling out the **Customer Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a template for different types of customer profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new customers, and helps ensure the information is correct each time. 

If you create:
* Multiple templates for use with more than one type of customer, you can choose the suitable template when you add a customer.
* Only one template is used for all new customers. 

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected customers. To create a template, fill in the information to be reused on the **Customer Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the customer card as a template](sales-how-register-new-customers.md#to-save-the-customer-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Customer Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add the **Credit Limit** field to a template. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a customer from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.  

### To create a new customer card

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

The **Prices & Discounts** action provides options for managing special prices or discounts for a customer when an order meets certain criteria. When purchasing a certain item, ordering a minimum quantity, or buying before a date, such as when a campaign ends, are examples of such criteria. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

The customer is now registered, and the customer card is ready to be used on sales documents.  

### To save the customer card as a template

You can use a customer card as a template when you create new customer cards.

1. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Customer Template** page opens showing the customer card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the customer.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes you want to apply to new customer cards created with this template.  
5. When you complete the new customer template, choose **OK**.

The customer template is added to the list of customer templates, and you can use it to create new customer cards.

## Delete customer cards

If you post a transaction for a customer, you can't delete the customer card because the ledger entries might be needed for auditing. To delete customer cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.  

## Manage credit limits

Credit limits, balance amounts, and payment terms make it possible for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to issue a credit and an overdue balance warning when you enter a sales order. Furthermore, reminder term and finance charge term elements enable you to invoice interest and/or extra fees.  

The **Credit Limit** field on a customer card specifies the maximum amount you allow the customer to exceed the payment balance before warnings are issued. When you enter information in journals, quotes, orders, and invoices, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tests both the sales header and individual sales lines to determine if the credit limit is exceeded.

You can post even if the credit limit exceeds. A blank field means there's no credit limit for this customer.  

You can choose not to receive warnings when the customer's credit limit is exceeded, and you can specify which types of warnings you want to see.

### To specify credit limit warnings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, then choose the related link.

2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Credit Warnings** field, choose the relevant option as described in the following table:

    |Option| Description|
    |------|------------|
    |**Both Warnings**| Both the **Credit Limit** and the **Balance Due** fields on the customer's card are checked, and a warning is shown if the customer exceeds its credit limit or has an overdue balance.|
    |**Credit Limit**|The value in the **Credit Limit** field on the customer's card is compared with the customer's balance, and a warning is shown if the customer's balance exceeds this amount.|
    |**Overdue Balance**|The **Balance Due** field on the customer's card is checked, and a warning is shown if the customer has an overdue balance.|
    |**No Warning**|No credit warnings are shown regarding the customer's status.|

## Assign a salesperson

You can assign salespeople to customer ship-to address rather than their billing address so your sales reports reflect the true geographical distribution of your sales. Assigning a salesperson to a customer's ship-to address gives you more precise insights and optimizes resource allocation.

Assign a salesperson on the **Customer** card page by choosing **Customer**, and then **Ship-To Addresses** to open the **Ship-to Addresses List** page. Choose **Manage**, and then **Edit** to open the **Ship-to Address** card page. Enter or choose a **Salesperson Code** to select the salesperson.

When you choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option as a **Ship-To** location on a sales document, the **Salesperson Code** updates to match the salesperson from the **Ship-to** rather than the **Bill-to** address.

# Record purchases with purchase invoices and orders

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Purchase invoices and purchase orders are also used to dynamically update inventory levels, meaning you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices or orders, contribute to profit figures and financial key performance indicators (KPIs) in your Role Center.

## Record purchases with purchase invoices

When you receive the inventory items or the purchased service is complete, post the purchase invoice to update inventory and financial records and to activate payment to the vendor according to the payment terms. [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

> [!CAUTION]  
> Do not post a purchase invoice for physical items until you receive the items and know the final cost of the purchase, including any additional charges. Otherwise, your inventory value and profit figures may be skewed.

### Create and post a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to create a purchase invoice. The steps for creating a purchase order are similar. The main difference is that purchase orders have some extra fields and actions for physical handling of items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**,  then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with standard information for the selected vendor. If the vendor isn't registered, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of the new vendor.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new vendor, choose **Yes**.
    3. To learn more on how to fill in the vendor card, go to [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  
    4. When you complete the vendor card, choose **OK** to return to the **Purchase Invoice** page.

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You're now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources purchased from the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up recurring purchase lines for the vendor, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the invoice by choosing the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or a service.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amount are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you select in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the vendor card.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

6. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up invoice discounts for the vendor, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Vendor Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met. The related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field.
7. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices. For more information on what happens when you post purchase documents, see [Posting Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

> [!NOTE]
> In rare cases, the posted amounts may deviate from what is displayed in the totals fields. This is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
>
> To check the amounts that will actually be posted, go to the **Statistics** page, which takes the rounding calculations into account. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields will be updated to include rounding calculations.

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice before you pay the vendor. For example, if you need to correct a typo or change the purchase early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). To reverse a purchase for items or services on a posted purchase invoice for which the payment is processed, create a purchase credit memo. Learn more at [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

[Open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Purchasing noninventory items

The lines on a purchase invoice can be of the **Resource** or **Item** type. Item cards can be further classified as of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type, which specifies if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit (also applicable for resources), or a physical unit that isn't kept in inventory. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The purchase invoice process is the same for all mentioned types.

> [!NOTE]
> With the **Resource** purchase line type, you can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. Learn more at [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).
>
> To use a purchased resource, you may need to set the resource's capacity and manually assign it to a project. Purchasing a resource creates a resource ledger entry; however, resource ledger entries are not tracked for quantity and value as, for example, items are. If quantity and value tracking is required, then consider using other line item types.

## When to use purchase orders

Use purchase orders if you need to record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity isn't available at the vendor. If you deliver sold items directly from your vendor to your customer as a drop shipment, you must also use purchase orders. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).

In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same as purchase invoices. The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for a purchase order.

## Receive items with a purchase order

The following steps describe how to receive items with a purchase order. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Open an existing purchase order, or create a new one.
3. In the **Qty. to Receive** field, enter the received quantity.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the received quantity is more than the quantity on the purchase order, and the vendor has been set up to allow over-receipts, use the **Over-Receive** field to handle the excess quantity. Learn more in the [To receive more items than you ordered](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#receive-more-items-than-you-ordered) section.
4. Choose the **Post** action.

  The value in the **Qty. Received** field is updated. If this receipt is partial, the value is lower than the value in the **Quantity** field.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a warehouse handling, you can't use the **Post** action on the purchase order to register receipt. That's because a warehouse employee has already posted the purchase order quantity as received. Learn more at [Design Details - Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## Receive more items than you ordered

When more goods arrive than were ordered, you might want to receive them instead of canceling the receipt. For example, it might be cheaper to keep the excess items in inventory than return them, or your vendor might offer a discount for keeping them.

The following video shows how to work with over-receipts.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=61ce06f8-b3e7-42fd-b332-85f09d65a4e1]

<!--move the over-receipt setup info to an article about purchasing. Keep the concept info here and link to the steps-->
### Set up over-receipts

Create over-receipt codes to define a percentage by which a received quantity can exceed the ordered quantity. Specify the percentage in the **Over-Receipt Tolerance %** field. You then assign the code on the Item Card or Vendor Card pages for items and vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Over-Receipt Codes**, then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Assign the over-receipt code to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Item Card** page for the item.
3. In the **Over-Receipt Code** field, choose the code that contains the percentage you want to allow for over-receipts.

The over-receipt code is assigned to the item. Purchase orders or warehouse receipts for the item now allow you to receive more than the ordered quantity within the over-receipt tolerance percentage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up an approval workflow requiring over-receipts to be approved before they can be handled. Select the **Approval Required** checkbox on the **Over-Receipt Codes** page. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

### Over-receive an order

On purchase lines and warehouse receipt lines, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field is used to record over-received quantities, meaning quantities exceeding the ordered-quantity value in the **Quantity** field.

When you handle an over-receipt, you can increase the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field to the quantity received. The **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the excess quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the excess quantity in the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field. The **Qty. to Receive** field updates to show the ordered quantity plus the excess quantity. The following procedure described how to fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field.  

1. On a purchase order or a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field.

    If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded.

    If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed. Investigate whether another over-receipt code allows it. Otherwise, only the ordered quantity can be received, and the excess quantity must be handled another way, such as returning it to the vendor.

2. Post the receipt as you would any other receipt.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not automatically handle financial aspects of over-receipts. You must manually handle this in agreement with the vendor, for example, by the vendor forwarding a new or updated invoice.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Posting purchases

On a purchase document, you can choose between the following posting actions:

* **Post**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post and Print**
<!--* **Test Report**-->
* **Post Batch**

When a purchase document is posted, the vendor's account, the general ledger (G/L), the item ledger entries, and the resource ledger entries are updated.

For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Vendor Ledger Entry** table and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase can result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:

* **Item Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Item** type.
* **G/L Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **G/L Account** type.
* **Resource Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Resource** type.

In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

You can always review various ledger entries that are created as a result of postings. Choose **Preview Posting** to validate document and inspect expected ledger entries.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you post a purchase order for items, you can create both a receipt and an invoice. These can be done simultaneously or independently. You can also create a partial receipt and a partial invoice by completing the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual purchase order lines before you post. Note that you cannot create a purchase invoice from a purchase order for products or services that have not been received. That is, before you can invoice, you must have recorded a receipt, or you must choose to receive and invoice at the same time.

You can either post or post and print. If you choose to post and print, a report is printed when the order is posted. You can also choose the **Post Batch** action to post several orders at the same time. Learn more at [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted purchase lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. Afterward, the posted entries are available on various pages, including the **Vendor Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Resource Ledger Entries**, **Purchase Receipts**, and **Posted Purchase Invoices** pages.

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Payment Reference** field. Learn more at [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# How to use approval workflows

When a record, such as a purchase document or a customer card, needs to be approved by someone in your organization, you send an approval request as part of a workflow. Based on how the workflow is set up, the appropriate approver is then notified that the record requires their approval.

You set up approval workflows on the **Workflow** page. You must also set up approval users, including any relevant amount limits, on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Workflows](across-set-up-workflows.md).  

In addition to the approval workflows described in this article, you can perform various other workflow tasks. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Core approval workflows for purchases documents, sales documents, payment journals, customer cards, and item cards are ready to start as guides. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## Request a record approval

The following task is performed by an approval user.

1. On the page that presents the record, choose the **Send Approval Request** action.
2. To see all your approval requests, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval Request Entries**, then choose the related link.  

The status of the approval entry is updated from **Created** to **Open**. The status of the record, such as a purchase invoice, is updated from **Open** to **Pending Approval** and remains locked for processing until all approvers have approved the record.

When all required approvers have approved the record, the status changes to **Released**. You can then continue working with the record.

## Cancel approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

A customer may want to change an order after it's been submitted for approval. In this case, you can cancel the approval process, make the necessary changes to the order, then request approval again.

- On the page displaying the record, choose the **Cancel Approval Request** action.

When the approval request has been canceled, the status of the related approval entry is changed to **Canceled**. The status of the record is updated from **Pending Approval** to **Open**. At this point, the approval process can start again.

## Approve or reject approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

You can process approval requests on the **Requests to Approve** page, including approving multiple requests at a time. Alternatively, you can approve individual records by choosing the link in the notification that you receive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of the record(s) you want to approve or reject.
3. Choose the **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Delegate** actions.

When a record has been approved or rejected, the approval status in the **Status** field changes to **Approved** or **Rejected**, respectively.

If an approver hierarchy is set up, the record status is **Pending Approval** until all requested approvers have approved the record. Then the record status changes to **Released**.

At the same time, the approval status changes from **Created** to **Open** as soon as an approval request for the record is created. If the request is rejected, the approval status changes to **Rejected**. The status remains **Open** or **Rejected** until all approvers have approved the request.

## Delegate approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

To prevent records from piling up or otherwise blocking the workflow, the approver and the approval administrator can delegate an approval request to a substitute approver. The substitute can either be a designated substitute, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. You typically use this feature if an approver is unavailable or unable to approve requests before the due date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of approval requests you want to delegate to a substitute approver, then choose the **Delegate** action.

A notification to approve the request is sent to the substitute approver.

## Manage overdue approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

At regular intervals you'll need to remind approval workflow users of overdue approval requests; you'll use the **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** function to do so.

The **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** function checks for all open approval requests currently overdue. Each approver with at least one overdue approval entry receives a notification with the list of all their overdue approval requests. The notification is also sent to their approver and all the requesters of the overdue approvals. This last step helps if the overdue approval entry must be delegated to a substitute.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Overdue Approval Requests**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Overdue Approval Requests** page, choose the **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** action.

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item card, and variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> Although you can assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares aren't available on SKUs. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)

# Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central

This article provides an overview of what an administrator can do to control OneDrive for Business integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers benefit from automatic integration with no extra setup required to use the open and share in OneDrive features. With the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, you can give users access to even more OneDrive features, like opening Excel file in OneDrive&mdash;or even turn off all features.  

## Configure OneDrive for integration with Business Central

This section discusses requirements that must be met in OneDrive for Business to configure the integration with Business Central and task you can do to manage the integration.

### Minimum requirements

* Each user must have a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and OneDrive as part of a Microsoft 365 plan.
* OneDrive must be set up for each user.

### Managing privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've chosen to deploy Business Central and OneDrive to different countries or regions, the files generated by Business Central and placed in OneDrive may cross data residency boundaries. Make sure to confirm your organization's policies and government compliance requirements for data residency before enabling the connection to OneDrive.

Administrators and end users control the content stored in OneDrive, and this data is owned solely by your organization. For more information, see [How SharePoint and OneDrive safeguard your data in the cloud](/sharepoint/safeguarding-your-data). You can also visit our [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)<!--(https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)-->, which explains the data that Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.

By enabling this service connection, you agree:

(a) to share data from Dynamics 365 Business Central with the service provider, who will use it according to its terms and privacy policy; (b) the compliance levels of the service provider may be different than Dynamics 365 Business Central; and (c) Microsoft may share your contact information with this service provider if needed for it to operate and troubleshoot the service.

## Configure Business Central

With Business Central online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive is automatically configured for you, and the OneDrive features are readily available to users by default. If you want to turn off some or all of the features off, you can use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide in the Business Central client.

Configuring Business Central on-premises is different because the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't configured for you. You'll have to do it manually. For more information, see [Configuring OneDrive Integration with Business Central On-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

### About multiple environments

OneDrive integration is configured per environment, that is, your settings will apply to all companies in that environment. If your organization has more than one environment, you'll have to configure OneDrive integration for each.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you'll see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure OneDrive file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]
4. Choose **Next**>**Done**.

### Switching to new OneDrive integration after upgrade

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup was introduced in 2022 release wave 2, version 21.0. Previously, the OneDrive integration used the **SharePoint Connection Setup**, which has been deprecated and will be removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. After you've upgraded to version 21, OneDrive will still work as before. But we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration. Making this switch now will make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it will enable you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup makes the transition from the legacy SharePoint setup easy and seamless.

To switch, just open and run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup directly, or open the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page. Follow the setup guide as described in the previous section.

## Restoring OneDrive and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

As part of a disaster recovery exercise, administrators might need to restore a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment to a backup from a time in the past, and synchronize OneDrive storage to that same point in time. OneDrive provides recovery various tools, such as restoring a user’s OneDrive to a previous time, restore a previous version of an individual file, or restore deleted files. For more information, see the following articles:

* For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Restoring an Environment in the Admin Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-backup-restore).
* For OneDrive, see [Restore your OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)

## Governance

The SharePoint admin center provides extensive control over policies that govern the use of OneDrive throughout the organization. Users who have at least the [SharePoint administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) role can set up policies that determine who can access OneDrive, where data resides, the content lifecycle, and much more. The following links provide information about often-used features and settings that may enhance your integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Set Up Standard Service Codes

When you perform typical service, you often have to create service documents that use service lines that contain similar information. To make it easy to create these lines, you can set up standard service codes that have a predefined set of service lines. When you choose the code on a service document, the lines are entered automatically. You can set up any number of standard service codes, and each code can have an unlimited number of service lines of different types, including item, resource, cost, or standard text linked to it. You create service lines of each standard service code on the **Standard Service Code** card. You then assign standard service codes to service item groups on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page. Later, when you create a service document, you can use the **Get Standard Service Codes** action to add service lines.  
  
> [!Tip]
> You can use the same concept to create lines on sales and purchase documents. For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).  
  
## To set up a standard service code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Service Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.  

## To assign a standard service code to a service item group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.

# Undo Assembly Posting

Undo the posting of an assembly order to correct a mistake or remove an unwanted posting.

When you undo a posted assembly order, corrective item ledger entries are created to reverse the original entries. Each positive output entry for the assembly item is reversed by a negative output entry. Each negative consumption entry for an assembly component is reversed by a positive consumption entry. Fixed cost application is automatically created between the corrective and original entries to ensure exact cost reversal.  

When you undo a fully posted assembly order, you can recreate the original order. For example, to make corrections before you post it again.  

When you undo a partially posted assembly order, all affected quantity fields, such as the **Assembled Quantity**, **Consumed Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity** fields, are restored to the values they had before the posting.  

To recreate or restore assembly orders, the item in the original posting must meet the following conditions:  

* It's still in inventory. That is, it hasn't been sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions.  
* It isn't reserved.  
* It's in the bin that it was output to.  

Assembly orders can only be restored if the number and sequence of lines on the original assembly order aren't changed.  

> [!TIP]  
> To resolve conflicts caused by changes in the lines, manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the posted assembly order. You can post the assembly order and then recreate it when you undo the posting.  

The following procedure describes how to undo posted assembly orders that contain items that were assembled-to-stock. To undo posted assembly orders with items that were assembled-to-order, use the **Undo Shipment** action on the related posted shipment. To learn more about undoing shipments, go to [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md). Undoing the posted assembly order happens in the same way as described in that article.  

## To undo posting of an assembly order

You can undo fully or partially posted assembly orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Assembly Orders**, and choose the related link.  

   Each partial posting creates a separate posted assembly order.  
2. Open the posted assembly order that you want to undo, and then choose the **Undo Assembly** action.  

    If the posted assembly order is related to a fully posted assembly order that's been deleted, you can recreate then deleted order. For example, you might recreate the order because you want to reprocess it.  
3. To recreate the assembly order, choose **Yes**. To undo the posting without recreating the assembly order, choose **No**.  

The **Reversed** field on the assembly order changes to **Yes**. The assembly order posting is now reversed. You can process the entire assembly order if you chose to recreate it, or the open assembly order that you have restored to its original state.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To restore quantities from multiple partial postings in an assembly order, you must undo all the posted assembly orders by following steps 1 through 3.

# The tax file formats (DK) extension
If you engage in trade with companies, or internal branches or subsidiaries, in other EU countries/regions you must report information about the activities to SKAT and to Statistics Denmark. If you use the VAT and Intrastat reporting features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this extension can ensure that the file you export is compatible with requirements from these organizations. The extension adds the MS-ECSL Report Export File and Intrastat Export Lines submission codeunits to your VAT Report configuration, so you can export data in the new format right away.

The extension is free, you just need to install it.

# Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze fixed assets data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets," "Depreciations over time," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets processes:

- [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

<!-- TODO: add examples for 

insurance coverage ledger entries

-->

## Fixed assets ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of fixed assets scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Fixed Assets (Current value)](#example-fixed-assets-current-value) | Track asset value, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Date**, **FA Posting Type**, and **Amount** |
| [Asset value changes over time](#example-asset-value-changes-over-time) | Track asset value changes over time. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **FA Posting Type**, **FA Posting Date**, and **Amount** |
|[Fixed asset depreciations over time](#example-fixed-asset-depreciations-over-time) | Track depreciations over time, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Year**, **FA Posting Month**, **Amount**, and **FA Posting Type** |

### Example: fixed assets current value

To track the value of one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the **FA Posting Date** and **FA Posting Type** fields.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Asset overview - value**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

### Example: asset value changes over time

To track asset value changes over time, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **FA Posting Type** field to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Drag the **FA Posting Year** and **FA Posting Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Asset value changes over time**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Example: fixed asset depreciations over time

To track depreciation for one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Drag the **FA Posting Year** and **FA Posting Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. In the **FA Posting Type** filter field, choose **Depreciation**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Depreciations over time**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see depreciation over time." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png":::

## Using the Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis query

You can use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query to analyze fixed asset ledger entries. The query adds additional information to the ledger entries, such as the fixed asset class, subclass, location, and depreciation book.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets

When you post fixed asset journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **FA Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets is typically done on the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604) page.

You might also want to use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query.

# Register Employees

To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first add each employee by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page.

## Adding new employees

You can add new employees manually, by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a templates for different types of employee profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new employees, and helps ensure that the information is correct each time. If you create templates for more than one type of employee, you can choose the template to use when you add an employee. If you create only one template it will be used for all new employees. After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected employees. To create a template, you fill in the information that you want to reuse on the Employee Card page, and then save it as a template.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Employee Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping employee records up-to-date can simplify personnel-related tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the Employee Card page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab on the **Employee Card** page. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

## To set up an employee

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Employee Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To insert a picture of an employee

If you have a picture of an employee, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. In the **Employee Picture** FactBox, choose the drop-down button, and then choose **Import**.
4. On the **Select a picture to upload** page, then do one of the following steps to upload the picture file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The picture is inserted in the **Employee Picture** FactBox.

## To register various information about an employee

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employees’ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. Choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
4. **In the Alternate Address List** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat step 4 for each alternate address.

# Block vendors

You can block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor on purchase documents or post payments to the vendor.

The following table describes the options for blocking vendors.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
|**Payment**|New payments can't be created for this vendor.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this vendor.|  

## To block a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the vendor that you want to block.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose one of the options for blocking.

## Handling vendor payment disputes

You can out vendor ledger entries **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document.

To learn more, go to [Handling vendor payment disputes](payables-how-handling-payment-disputes.md).

# Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files.

## To find posted documents without incoming document records

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a G/L account for whose general ledger entries you want to see posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records, and then choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** action.
3. Alternatively, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. On the **General Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Documents** action.

The **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page opens showing posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records represented by general ledger entries on the G/L account that you opened the page for. The page can show a maximum of 1000 lines. By default, the **Date Filter** field therefore contains a filter that limits the lines to entries with posting dates from the beginning of the accounting period to the work date.

## To connect found documents to existing incoming document records

1. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, select the line for a posted document that you want to connect to an existing incoming document record, and then choose the **Select Incoming Document** action.
2. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the incoming document record that you want to connect to posted document found, and then choose the **OK** button.
3. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, the selected incoming document record is now connected to the posted document, as you can see in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

If a relevant incoming document record doesn't exist on the **Incoming Documents** page, then you can create it. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

# Setting up user accounts for integrating with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the administrator user account

To set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a user account that is assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Essential or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Premium license. We'll use this account one time to install and configure some required components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During set-up, you'll be asked to provide credentials for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. Provide the credentials of an account that is a licensed user and assigned to the **System Administrator** security role on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment and [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role on the tenant to which the environment belongs. This account doesn't need a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because it will be used only to do set-up tasks in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
>
> After the connection setup is done, you can remove this [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] user. The integration will continue using the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

The Base Integration Solution creates the following role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this is assigned only to the automatically created user account for synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the application user who runs the integration should have the **Business Central Dataverse Integration** role. The application user doesn't need the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] licenses.

When you install the Base Integration Solution, it configures the permissions for the integration user account. If those permissions are changed manually, you can reset them. Choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page to reinstall the Base Integration Solution. This step will deploy the  Business Central Integration security role.

<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Ship items with a warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about shipping items, go to [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to methods C and D in the table. In both methods, you start by creating a shipment document from a business source document. Then you pick the specified items for the shipment.

When a location requires warehouse shipments, you can ship items based on source documents that were released to the warehouse. Releasing source documents makes the items on them ready to be handled in the warehouse. The following are examples of source documents:

* Sales orders
* Purchase return orders
* Transfer orders
* Service orders

You can create a warehouse shipment in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Shipment** action in the source document to create a warehouse shipment for the document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document to release it to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a **Warehouse Shipment** for one or many released source documents. The following procedure describes how to create warehouse shipment in a pull fashion.

## To ship items using a warehouse shipment document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipments**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**.  
3. In the **No.** field, choose the number series to use to create an ID for the shipment.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, choose the location you're shipping from. 

    When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information from the location is copied to each line.  
5. If the location requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  
6. You can get the source document in two ways:

    * Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Outbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires shipment.
    * Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page opens. You can select the source document filter and apply it. All released source document lines that fulfill the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your location uses cross-docking and bins for each line, you can review the quantity of items placed in the cross-dock bins. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantities whenever the fields on the shipment are updated. If they're the items on the shipment you're preparing, you can create a pick for all the items and then complete the shipment. Learn more at [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

7. Create a warehouse pick. If the location requires picking, you can create pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

    * In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to pick and specify information about the picks. For example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
    * In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get your assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted. Learn more at [Pick Items for Warehouse Shipment](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > For a location that doesn't require picking, you can print warehouse shipment and use it as a picking list.

8. Specify the quantity to ship.  

    For a location that requires picking, the **Qty. to Ship** field is updated automatically when the pick is registered. Otherwise, the **Qty. to Ship** field is filled with the quantity outstanding for each line when warehouse shipment line is created.

    You can change the quantity, but you can't ship more items than the number in the **Qty. Outstanding** field on the source document line or the **Qty. Picked** field if picking is required.

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Ship** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the shipping quantities. To add the quantity available for shipping, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Ship** action.

9. Post the shipment.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse shipment, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that define which items to ship.

1. In the warehouse shipment, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. 
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Outbound** page opens.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example you can select types of source documents, such as sales or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page on which you set the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page and are available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

If bins are mandatory at the location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests a zone and bin code on the warehouse shipment document.

* For advanced configurations in which a location uses directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card**. If a **Shipment Bin Code** isn't specified, the field is blank. If the item and shipment bin don't match, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] leaves the shipment bin blank.
* In other cases, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card** first. If a shipment bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

## Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments

In assemble-to-order scenarios, use the **Qty. to Ship** field on warehouse shipment lines to record how many units are assembled. The quantity is posted as assembly output when you post the warehouse shipment. For other warehouse shipment lines, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is zero.

When workers finish assembling some or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, record the quantity on the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line. Then choose the **Post Shipment** action. The assembly output is posted, including the component consumption. A sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the sales order.

From the assembly order, you can choose **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** to access the warehouse shipment line.

After you post the warehouse shipment, various fields on the sales order line are updated to show progress in the warehouse. The following fields are also updated to show how many assemble-to-order quantities remain to be assembled and shipped:

* **ATO Whse. Outstanding Qty.**
* **ATO Whse. Outstd. Qty. (Base)**

> [!NOTE]
> In combination scenarios where a part of the quantity must be assembled and another must be shipped from inventory, two warehouse shipment lines are created. One is for the assemble-to-order quantity, and one is for the inventory quantity.
>
> The assemble-to-order quantity is handled as described in this article. The inventory quantity is handled as a regular warehouse shipment line. To learn more about combination scenarios, go to [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

# Manage Interactions for Segments
The **Segment** page is a type of worksheet where you can:

* Create segments.
* Save the segmentation criteria you have used to select contacts.
* Log the segment and record interactions involving the contacts within the segment.

## Segmenting
There are several ways to create segments:

* You can manually enter the contacts you want to include in the segment in the segment lines.
* You can select contacts.
* You can reuse a logged segment as the basis to create a new one.
* You can reuse saved segmentation criteria.

## Interactions
On the **Segment** page, you can create interactions for several contacts simultaneously. For example, you can merge a segment with a Microsoft Word document, so that you can send a letter to all the contacts in the segment.

You can specify information about the interaction for the segment on the **Segment** header. For example, you can decide which interaction template you want to use for all the contacts, specify a description, a correspondence type, and so on. However, you can modify this information in the segment line for each particular contact, for example, by specifying another description for one contact. If you are merging a segment with a Microsoft Word document, you can personalize the document to be sent for one or several of the contacts within the segment, for example, by adding individualized comments to the document.

## Logging
On the **Segment** page, when you choose **Log**, the application records the interactions on the **Interaction Log Entry** page, and logs the segment. After you have logged the segment, you can only find it on the **Logged Segments** page.

On the **Logged Segments** page, you can decide to create a follow-up segment containing the same contacts as the segment you have logged.

# Set up rules for automatic application of payments

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you set up rules to govern how payment text (on a bank transaction) is automatically matched with text on related open (unpaid) invoices, credit memos, or other entries when you use the **Apply Automatically** function on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. For more information, see [Reconcile payments using automatic application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

You set up new payment application rules by choosing which types of data on a payment reconciliation journal line must match with data on one or more open entries before the related payment is automatically applied to the open entries. The quality of each automatic application is shown as a value of **Low** to **High** in the **Match Confidence** field on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page according to the payment application rule that was used.

Each row on the **Payment Application Rules** page represents a payment application rule. Rules are applied in the order specified by the **Sorting Order** field. If multiple rules are used simultaneously, then the match confidence of the highest sorted rule is used.

The automatic application function is based on prioritized matching criteria. First the function tries, in prioritized order, to match text in the five **Related-Party** fields on a journal line with text in the bank account, name, or address of customers or vendors with unpaid documents representing open entries. Then, the function tries to match text in the **Transaction Text** and **Additional Transaction Info** fields on a journal line with text in the **External Document No.** and **Document No.** fields on open entries. Last, the function tries to match the amount in the **Statement Amount** field on a journal line with the amount on open entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Text matching is only possible for text longer than four characters.

In addition to the matching criteria, the following applies concerning the sign of the payment amount:

- For negative amounts, a match is made first against open entries representing customer invoices and then against vendor credit memos.
- For positive amounts, a match is made first against open entries representing vendor invoices and then against customer credit memos.

## To set up a payment application rule
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Application Rules**, and then choose the related link.
2. Define a new or edited payment application rule by filling the fields on a line as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|**Match Confidence**|Specifies your confidence in the application rule that you define on the line. <br /></br>A value that you specify in this field is shown in the **Match Confidence** field on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page according to the quality of the automatic payment application on the journal line.|
|**Priority**|Specifies the priority of the application rule relative to other application rules that are defined as lines on the **Payment Application Rules** page. 1 represents the highest priority.|
|**Related Party Matched**|Specifies how much information about the customer or vendor, such as address, city name, and bank account number, on the payment reconciliation journal line must match with information about the open entry before the application rule will be used to automatically apply the payment to the open entry.|
|**Document No./Ext. Document No. Matched**|Specifies whether text on the payment reconciliation journal line must match with the value in the **Document No.** field or the **External Document No.** field on the open entry before the application rule will be used to automatically apply the payment to the open entry.|
|**Number of Entries Within Amount Tolerance Found**|Specifies how many entries for a customer or vendor must match the amount including payment tolerance before the application rule will be used to automatically apply a payment to the open entry.|
|**Review Required**|Specifies whether the automatic payment application is recommended for manual review by the user before posting. Choosing the **Lines to Review** field on the **Payment Application Journal** page starts a guided experience where you can easily review multiple applications in a sequence on the **Payment Application Review** page.|

The following table describes the standard payment application rules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Important]
> The payment application rules may be different in your implementation of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

title: Design Details - Revaluation
description: You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value.

# Design Details: Revaluation

You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value. You can also backdate a revaluation to correctly update the cost of goods sold (COGS) for items you've already sold. Items that use the Standard costing method and aren't completely invoiced can also be revalued.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following flexibility is supported regarding revaluation:  

- The revaluable quantity can be calculated for any date, also back in time.  
- For items using Standard costing method, expected cost entries are included in revaluation.  
- Inventory decreases affected by revaluation are detected.  

## Calculate the revaluable quantity

The quantity you can revalue is the remaining inventory that's available on a given date. The quantity is the total of completely invoiced item ledger entries that you post on or before the revaluation date.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Items using the Standard costing method are treated differently when calculating the revaluable quantity per item, location, and variant. The quantities and values of item ledger entries that are not completely invoiced are included in the revaluable quantity.  

After a revaluation has been posted, you can post an inventory increase or decrease with a posting date that comes before the revaluation posting date. However, this quantity will not be affected by the revaluation. To balance the inventory, only the original revaluable quantity is considered.  

Because you can revaluate on any date, you must have conventions for when you consider an item as part of inventory. For example, when the item is on inventory and when the item is work in process (WIP).  

### Example  

The following example illustrates when a WIP item transitions to become part of inventory. The example is based on the production of a chain with 150 links.  

![WIP inventory and revaluation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_10_revaluation_wip.png "WIP inventory and revaluation")  

**1Q**: The user posts the purchased links as received. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|LINK|Purchase|150|1|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Now an item using the Standard costing method is available for revaluation.  

**1V**: The user posts the purchased links as invoiced and the links become part of inventory, from a financial point of view. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|1|1|  

 **2Q + 2V**: The user posts the purchased links as consumed for the production of the iron chain. From a financial point of view, the links become part of WIP inventory.  The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|LINK|Consumption|-150|1|  

The following table shows the resulting value entry.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  

The valuation date is set to the date of the consumption posting (02-01-20), as a regular inventory decrease.  

**3Q**: The user posts the chain as output and finishes the production order. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-15-20|CHAIN|Output|1|3|  

**3V**: The user runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which posts the chain as invoiced to indicate that all material consumption has been completely invoiced. From a financial point of view, the links are no longer part of WIP inventory when the output is completely invoiced and adjusted. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|2|2|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  
|02-15-20|Direct Cost|02-15-20|150.00|3|3|  

## Expected cost in revaluation

The quantity you can revalue is the sum of the quantity for completely invoiced item ledger entries that you posted on or before the revaluation date. When some items are received or shipped but not invoiced, you can't calculate their inventory value. Items that use the Standard costing method are not limited in this way.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Another type of expected cost that can be revalued is WIP inventory, within certain rules. For more information, see [WIP Inventory Revaluation](design-details-revaluation.md#wip-inventory-revaluation).  

When you calculate the revaluable quantity for items that use the Standard costing method, the calculation includes item ledger entries that aren't completely invoiced. These entries are revalued when you post the revaluation. When you invoice the revalued entry, you create the following value entries:  

- The usual invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**. The cost amount on this entry is the direct cost from the source line.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Variance**. This entry records the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation**. This entry records the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.

### Example  

The following example is based on the production of the chain in the previous example. This example illustrates how the three types of entries are created, based on the following scenario:  

1.  You post the purchased links as received with a unit cost of LCY 2.00.  
2.  You post a revaluation of the links with a new unit cost of LCY 3.00, updating the standard cost to LCY 3.00.  
3.  You post the original purchase of the chain links as invoiced, which creates the following value entries:  

    1.  An invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**.  
    2.  A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation** to record the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.  
    3.  A value entry with an entry type of Variance, recording the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  

The following table shows the results.  

|Step|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|1.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|300.00|0.00|1|1|  
|2.|01-20-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|150.00|0.00|1|2|  
|3.a.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|-300.00|0.00|1|3|  
|3.b.|01-15-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|-150.00|0.00|1|4|  
|3.c.|01-15-20|Variance|01-15-20|0.00|450.00|1|5|  

## Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease  

Use the date of the posting or the revaluation to determine whether an inventory decrease is affected by a revaluation.  

The following table shows the criteria that's used for an item that doesn't use the Average costing method.  

|Scenario|Entry No.|Timing|Affected by revaluation|  
|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|  
|A|Earlier than revaluation entry number|Earlier than revaluation posting date|No|  
|B|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|No|  
|C|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|D|Later than revaluation entry no.|Earlier than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|E|Later than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|F|Later than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  

### Example  

The following example illustrates revaluation of an item that uses the FIFO costing method. The example is based on the following scenario:  

1.  On 01-01-20, you post a purchase of 6 units.  
2.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
3.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
4.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
5.  On 03-01-20, you calculate the inventory value for the item, and post a revaluation of the item’s unit cost from LCY 10.00 to LCY 8.00.  
6.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
7.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
8.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
9. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Scenario|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
||01-01-20|Purchase|01-01-20|6|60.00|1|1|  
||03-01-20|Revaluation|03-01-20|4|-8.00|1|5|  
|A|02-01-20|Sale|02-01-20|-1|-10.00|2|2|

## WIP inventory revaluation  

Revaluating WIP inventory implies that you revalue components that are registered as WIP inventory.  

It's important to have conventions that control when an item is WIP inventory from a financial point of view. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following conventions exist:  

- A purchased component becomes part of the raw material inventory when you post a purchase as invoiced.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component becomes part of the WIP inventory when you post its consumption with a production order.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component remains part of the WIP inventory until you invoice a production order (manufactured item).  

The way the valuation date for the value entry of consumption is set follows the same rules as for non-WIP inventory. To learn more, go to [Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease](#determine-whether-revaluation-affects-an-inventory-decrease).  

You can revalue WIP inventory under the following conditions:

- The revaluation date is before the posting dates of the corresponding item ledger entries of type Consumption.
- You haven't invoiced the production order.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** report shows the value of posted production order entries, and might be a little confusing for revalued WIP items.  

## Revaluate items with the Average costing method

You can only revaluate items that use the Average costing method if **Calculate Per** is *Item*.

You can only do revaluation at the end of the period selected in the **Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

Revaluation won't affect negative transactions in the current month, which is why fully applied inbound entries aren't included either.

### Example

This example shows what happens when you calculate the inventory value on the **Item Revaluation Journal** page. On the **Inventory Setup** page, **Item** is chosen in the **Average Cost Calc. Type** field, and **Month** is chosen in the **Average Cost Period** field.

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
25-04-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Purchase|3|3.00|2
27-04-23|Sale|-5|-5.00|3
28-04-23|Sale|-1|-1.00|4

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Design details: Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is the determination of the cost that is assigned to an inventory item, as expressed by the following equation.  

Ending inventory = beginning inventory + net purchases – cost of goods sold  

The calculation of inventory valuation uses the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the value entries for the item. The entries are classified according to the entry type that corresponds to the cost components, direct cost, indirect cost, variance, revaluation, and rounding. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Components](design-details-cost-components.md).  

Entries are applied against each other, either by the fixed application or according to the general cost-flow assumption defined by the costing method. One entry of inventory decrease can be applied to more than one increase entry with different posting dates and possibly different acquisition costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md). Therefore, calculation of the inventory value for a given date is based on summing up positive and negative value entries.  

## Inventory valuation report  
To calculate the inventory value in the **Inventory Valuation** report, the report begins by calculating the value of the item’s inventory at a given starting date. It then adds the value of inventory increases and subtracts the value of inventory decreases up to a given ending date. The end result is the inventory value on the ending date. The report calculates these values by summing the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field in the value entries, using the posting dates as filters.  

The printed report always shows actual amounts, that is, the cost of entries that have been posted as invoiced. Also, the report prints the expected cost of entries that are posted as received or shipped, if you select the Include Expected Cost field on the Options FastTab.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Values in the **Inventory Valuation** report is reconciled with the Inventory account in the general ledger, meaning the value entries in question have been posted to the general ledger.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Amounts in the **Value** columns of the report are based on the posting date of transactions for an item.  

## Inventory valuation - WIP report  
A manufacturing company needs to determine the value of three types of inventory:  

* Raw Materials inventory  
* WIP inventory  
* Finished Goods inventory  

The value of WIP inventory is determined by the following equation:  

* Ending WIP inventory = Beginning WIP inventory + manufacturing costs – cost of goods manufactured  

As for purchased inventory, the value entries provide the basis of the inventory valuation. The calculation is made using the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the item and capacity value entries associated with a production order.  

The purpose of WIP inventory valuation is to determine the value of the items whose manufacturing hasn't yet been completed on a given date. Therefore the WIP inventory value is based on the value entries related to the consumption and capacity ledger entries. Consumption ledger entries must be invoiced at the date of the valuation. Therefore, the **Inventory Valuation – WIP** report shows the costs representing the WIP inventory value in two categories: consumption and capacity.

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and non-transactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Using a pull model, subsidiaries pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you won't be able to complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that will be the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you haven't set that up yet. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you'll pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will find the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization get's stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain non-transactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. This helps prevented unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Delete** action.

## Use export and import to share a synchronization setup

If you're setting up several subsidiaries that use the same or similar synchronization settings, there's a time saver. Set up one subsidiary company and then export its setup to an .xml file. The file contains the entire setup, including table and field mappings and filter criteria. You can then import the file to the next subsidiary. To import or export a setup, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, use the **Import** or **Export** actions.

# Reverse journal postings and undo receipts/shipments

Reverse journal postings are useful, for example, for correcting errors and for clearing out an old accruals entry before entering a new one. A reverse entry is the same as the original entry, but has an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The reverse entry must have the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After you reverse an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed one time.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they're posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you posted an incorrect negative quantity, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, as received but not invoiced, you can undo the posting.

If you posted an incorrect positive quantity as shipped but not invoiced, you can undo the posting. For example, if you posted a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items.

> [NOTE!]
> Due to how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts and updates amounts in an additional reporting currency (ACY), you can't use this feature if you use ACY. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts amounts in local currency to the alternate currency, but doesn't net transactions. If you use ACY, you must manually reverse the amounts.

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry

You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry must originate from a journal posting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Reverse Transaction** action.
3. On the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page, choose the **Reverse** action.
4. Choose **Yes** to confirm the reversal.

## To post a negative entry  

Use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. By default, the field is available in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

## To undo a quantity on a posted purchase receipt  

The following steps describe how to undo a posted receipt of items or resources. The steps are similar for posted shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted receipt that you want to undo.  
3. Select the line or lines that you want to undo.  
4. Choose **Undo Receipt** action.

A corrective line is added under the selected receipt line. If the quantity was received in a warehouse receipt, then a corrective line is added on the posted warehouse receipt.  

The **Quantity Received** and **Qty. Rcd. Not Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order are set to zero.

## To undo and then redo a quantity on a posted return shipment

The following steps describe how to:

* Undo a posted return shipment of items or resources.
* Repost the purchase return with a new quantity.

The steps are similar for posted return receipts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Return Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted return shipment to undo.
3. Select the line or lines to undo.  

4. Choose the **Undo Return Shipment** action.  

    A corrective line is inserted in the posted document, and the **Return Qty. Shipped** and **Return Shpd. Not Invd.** fields on the return order are set to zero.  

    Now go back to the purchase return order and redo the posting.  

5. On the **Posted Return Shipment** page, take a note of the number in the **Return Order No.** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then select the related link.  
7. Open the return order in question, and then choose the **Reopen** action.  
8. Correct the entry in the **Quantity** field and post the purchase return order again.  

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

## Reverse a customer and vendor ledger entry with a realized gain or loss entry

You can use the **Reverse transaction** action to reverse payments that were applied to entries that originated in foreign currencies and were adjusted using the Exchange Rate Adjustment batch job. The feature works for both purchases and sales.

The following steps are a simple scenario that illustrates how it works:

1. Post a sales invoice for a customer using a foreign currency.
2. Adjust the exchange rate for that currency.
3. Post a payment applied to the invoice.
4. Unapply and reverse the payment transaction, for example, from the **Customer Ledger Entries** page.

# Work with Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system for collecting trade statistics of goods within these countries/regions. You use **Intrastat Report** to complete periodic Intrastat reporting (typically monthly), collecting, recording, and reporting trade of goods as per local government legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions; however, in practice, there are some differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules of what exactly and how to report.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features, but if you didn't upgrade your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering  the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.

> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). At that time, to use it, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

## Fill in the Intrastat report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report List**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** action to create a new **Intrastat Report**.
3. If you need to enter some internal information about the **Intrastat Report**, fill in this information in the **Description** field.
4. In the **Statistic Period** field, specify the month to report data for. Enter the period as a four-digit number with no spaces or symbols. Depending on your country/region, enter either the month first and then the year, or vice versa. For example, enter either *2206* or *0622* for June 2022.
5. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the Intrastat report header.
6. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher. But if you want to use this feature, you must switch the **Amount incl. Item Charges** field to **Yes**.
7. You can eventually set up extra configurations on the **Additional** FastTab:
   1. **Skip Recalculation for Zero Amounts** to specify that lines without amounts won't be recalculated during the batch job.
   2. **Skip Zero Amounts** to specify that item ledger entries without amounts won't be included in the batch job.
   3. **Skip Non-Invoiced Entries** to specify if item ledger entries that are shipped or received but not yet invoiced must be excluded from the process.
8. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the **Intrastat Report** lines. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Modify the Intrastat report

If needed, you can modify the lines, but whenever you change a value in the Intrastat report line, the **Correction** field will be automatically marked as **Yes**. Eventually, you can add a new line manually if there's a reason for that. To add a new line manually:

1. On the **Intrastat Report** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. Choose the **Receipt** or **Shipment** option in the **Type** field.
3. In the **Source Type** field, choose one of the sources: **Item Entry**, **FA Entry**, or **Job Entry**.
4. Based on the **Source Type** in the **Item No.** field, you can choose an **Item** (in both cases, **Item Entry** or **Job Entry**) or **Fixed Assets**.
5. Fill in other fields as you need for the Intrastat reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you manually add a new line to the Intrastat report, the **Date** field in the line must be inside the **Statistic Period** range you added on the header.

## Validate Intrastat lines

After you fill in the **Intrastat Report**, you can run the **Checklist Report** action to ensure that all information in the **Intrastat Report** is correct. Mandatory fields you have set on Intrastat Report Checklist page that is missing values will be shown in **Errors and warning** FactBox on the **Intrastat Report** page.

Run the **Intrastat Report Checklist** report to check Intrastat lines before they're exported to the required format. The check is run inside the **Intrastat Report**.

## Recalculate weight or supplementary unit of measure

If you got the error message *'Total Weight' in Intrastat Report Line must not be blank*, it's probably because you didn't set the **Net Weight** field on the used source, item, or fixed asset. In this case, search for the item or fixed asset card and add the required value. After that, you just need to reopen the **Intrastat Report** and follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Recalc. Weight/Suppl. UOM** action to recalculate the **Total Weight** and/or **Supplementary Quantity**.
2. Choose one of the options:

    1. **Weight** – to recalculate only the **Total Weight**, based on the current information about **Net Weight** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    2. **Supplemental UOM Qty** – to recalculate only the **Supplementary Quantity** on the **Intrastat Report** line if it exists, based on the current information about **Supplementary UOM** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    3. **Both** – to recalculate both **Total Weight** and **Supplementary Quantity**, based on the current information on the item and fixed asset cards.
3. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

## Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. Before creating the file, you should run the **Checklist Report** to check if all lines contain all necessary and valid information. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat List**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Intrastat Report** you want to report as a file.
3. If you haven't already done this, fill in the **Intrastat Report** manually or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The Intrastat file will be saved in the required format.

Once you create the file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically fill in the following details about reporting:

* The **Export Date** to specify the date when the report has been exported.
* The **Export Time** to specify the time when the report has been exported.

> [!NOTE]  
> Next time you create a file, the **Export Date** and **Export Time** fields will only keep information about the last file you created.

## Intrastat rules

### Grouping lines

In **Intrastat Report** lines, there's no grouping by any fields. All entries are copied from the original source, so you can quickly locate them based on the combination of **Source Type** and **Source Entry No**.

Grouping required by authorities will be provided in the exported file. You need to configure this in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Fixed assets reporting

Fixed assets will be shown in the Intrastat lines only if:

* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Acquisition Cost** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of purchases, and
* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Proceeds on Disposal** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of sales.

### Intrastat report statuses

When you work with the **Intrastat Report** you'll see a **Status** field on the document header. You can find the following statuses together with related rules:

* **Open**: This status is created automatically when you create a new Intrastat report and you can make all operations in this status.
* **Released**: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the status to *Released* when you create a file. From that moment, you can't modify your **Intrastat Report**. If you need to change something and report again, you can use the **Reopen** action to reopen the Intrastat report. Once the document is reopened, you can use the **Release** action to release the document again.
* **Reported**: Specifies whether the entry has already been reported to the tax authorities. This isn't a regular status but an independent field, and even if you reopened the Intrastat report, it would still show that the file is already created for this report.

### Locations in Intrastat reporting 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the information in the **Country/Region Code** field on the **Location Card** page as the country for **send from** or for **receive to** goods. When this information doesn't exist or location wasn't used, the system uses the information from the **Company Information** page.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If the company operates from more than one country, Intrastat reporting desn't work for all countries where locations are configured. Reporting is based only for the main country, as it's not currently possible to use multi-country reporting.  

### Triangular trade in Intrastat

Triangular trade involves trade between three countries or regions where goods bypass the reporting company's country. In Business Central, this can be facilitated through the [Drop Shipment](sales-how-drop-shipment.md) functionality. To enable this option, activate the **Include Drop Shipment** field in the **Intrastat Report Setup**.  

When you enable this option, the system uses the following rules, but only if you have the **Drop Shipment** marked in the **Sales Order**: 

| Receiving from | Delivering to | Expected Intrastat Result |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Country as in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Intrastat shipping line | 
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |   
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | Intrastat receiving line | 
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines | 
| Non-EU country | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Non-EU country | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| Non-EU country | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |

# Connecting to Your Business Central Data to Build a Business App Using Power Apps

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data available as a data source in Power Apps.  

> [!TIP]  
> Business Central now offers development and operations support for Power Platform in AL-Go and samples to get you started creating your own apps with Power Apps. These features are currently in preview. To learn more, go to [Business Central and Power Apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-overview) in the developer and IT pro help.

## Prerequisites

You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and with Power Apps.  

## Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power Apps

These steps add a Business Central table, like customers or items, as the data source of a Power Apps app.

1. In your browser, go to [powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), and then sign in.
2. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **+ Create**, and then select **More data sources** on the **Create app** page.
  
   <!-- This step opens Power Apps canavs. On first sign-in, you must specify the country/region.  -->
3. The **Connections** the list shows any existing data connections you have.

   - If there's a **Business Central** connection already, select it, and then select **Create**.

   - If you don't see a Business Central connection, select **+ New connection**, search for and select **Business Central**, and then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, then you must choose the **Business Central (on-premises)** connector.  
  
4. Power Apps connects to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Sign in using the Business Central account name and password. If you aren't an administrator of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you may have to sign in with another account.  
5. Once you've signed in, Power Apps displays a list of *Environments and companies* that are available from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Choose the environment and company that contains the data you want to connect to, such as *PRODUCTION - My Company*.  
6. Next, you're presented with a list of tables that are exposed as part of the API for your environment. Select the table that you want to connect to, and then choose **Connect**.

These so-called tables are exposed as endpoints by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Apps.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include data from other tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your app, then you must work with a developer to define a custom API in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

At this point, you have successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and are ready to begin building your Power App. You can always add more screens and connect to more data. Learn more at [Create a canvas app from a sample in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app).  

When you have designed and built your app, you can share it with your colleagues. For more information, see [Save and publish a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app).  

<!--
## Sample apps to get started

As a preview version, Business Central offers several sample apps that you can use as a starting point for building your own apps that use Business Central data. These sample apps are available in the [Business Central Demos](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos) repo on GitHub. For a quick overview on the apps, go to [Power Apps samples for Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-samples).

## Develop and maintain apps application lifecycle management

As an app developer, you may already be familiar with Business Central AL-Go. AL-Go is set of tools on GiHub that enables you to maintain professional DevOps processes for your Business Central AL projects. AL-Go supports source control and activities, like building, testing, and deploying. As a preview, Business Central now offers an Al-Go version that supports for Power Platform solutions. The preview, for example, includes workflows that let you push and pull Power Platfrom changes to and from enviroments. You can access the tools at [https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go-PTE). For more information, see [Application lifecycle management for Power Apps in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-alm).-->

# Financial Reporting frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Financial Reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## New report, row, or column definitions aren't available after an upgrade. How do I get access to them?

Financial report, row, and column definitions are stored as data in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. To make sure your definitions aren't overwritten or changed during upgrade, new definitions are only available in new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants.

To make new report, row, or column definitions available in existing companies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new tenant.
1. Export the definitions you would like as configuration packages.
1. Sign in to your tenant, and switch to the company where you want the new definitions.
1. Import the configuration packages with the new definitions.

To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).

## Why don't the numbers in my report balance with the general ledger?

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance with the general ledger. To learn more about possible reasons and ways to fix these issues, go to [Balancing reports to the general ledger](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger).

## How can I test my report?

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. To learn more, go to [Adding check figures](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#adding-check-figures).

## When should I use net change vs. balance at date?

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports. To learn more, go to [When to use net change or balance at date](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-net-change-or-balance-at-date).

## Which users can run or modify financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Permissions to view or edit financial reports](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#permissions-to-view-or-edit-financial-reports).

## How can I setup auditing on changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#set-up-the-change-log-for-financial-report-definitions).

## How can I get notified when financial report definitions change?

To learn more, go to [Get notified when financial report definitions change](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#get-notified-when-financial-report-definitions-change).

## How can I analyze changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-financial-report-definitions).

# Row definitions in Financial Reporting

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

## Create a new row definition

To create a new row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Enter a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description/* field, enter a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Enter an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a row definition

To edit the content of a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the relevant definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts**, **Insert CF Accounts**, and **Insert Cost Types** actions to create a row for each financial element you want to analyze. For example, you might have one row for current assets and another row for fixed assets. For inspiration, explore the financial reports in the CRONUS demonstration company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. You use these identifiers for calculated rows in the **Totalling** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The columns you define in a column definition represent columns three and up on the **Financial Report** page. The first two columns, **Row No.** and **Description**, are fixed.  

1. To format the rows, choose the **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, and **Double Underline** checkboxes. To learn more about formatting, go to [Format your financial reporting](#format-rows-in-your-financial-reports).

## Working with row formulas

A powerful feature in Financial Reporting is that you can use values computed in previous rows in row formulas defined in subsequent rows. Set the **Totaling Type** to **Formula**, and then write your calculation in the **Totalling** field on the same row.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how row formulas work. Your chart of accounts structure might differ from the accounts shown.

| Row No. | Description | Totaling Type | Totaling | ... | Show |
| ------- | ------|-------- | -------- | --- | ---- |
|         | ## Revenue calculation start | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| R      | Product Revenue | Posting Accounts      | 40000..40209                 | | Yes |
| R      | Discounts and Returns | Posting Accounts | 40910..40919 \| 40940..49999 | | Yes |
| F1      | Total Revenue    | Formula               | R                            | | Yes |
|         | ## Revenue calculation end   | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| L       | Total liabilities  | Account Category     | Liabilities                  | | Yes |
|         | Revenue to liabilities | Formula      | F1 / L                          | | Yes |

The example illustrates some different tips and tricks:

* You can use a formula row as a code comment. Remember to set the **Show** option to **No**.
* The formula in row F1 summarizes all numbers from rows with **R** in the **Row No.** field (the Row No. setting doesn't have to be unique).
* You can use results from previous calculations in new row formulas.

## Built-in row definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample row definitions that can help you quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Row definition code | Description | How to use this row definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 | 
-->

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending on how you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports that use them to match your setup.

## Format rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, you can format the rows in a row definition to provide visual cues that make it easier to find key information quickly. For example, lines that calculate totals often use bold font.

The following table describes the different formatting options on a row:

| Formatting property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Bold                | The row header is formatted in bold. | Yes | Yes |
| Italic              | The row header is formatted in italics. | No | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns in the report are formatted with an underline. Typically used rows that display a subtotal. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns in the report are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display a total. | No | Yes |
| New Page            | If you want to make a report with different sections separated by page breaks in the report output (for PDF or print), use this property on a row. This setting inserts a page break after the row.  | No | Yes |
| Show Opposite Sign  | The data in columns is formatted with the opposite sign from how they're calculated. Typically used to show debits in reports as negative amounts with a minus sign and credits as positive amounts. | Yes | Yes |

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over to reports when you use the Export to Excel action. If you often export reports to Excel, you might just use the tools that Excel provides rather than row definitions.

## Adding empty lines in your financial reports

If you want to add an empty line to a financial report, you can add a row and set the **Totalling Type** field.

The following table describes the different formatting options for a row that define an empty line:

| Value of the Totalling Type property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Formula (with empty Totalling value)     | The row is empty. | Yes | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with an underline. Typically used for rows that display a section. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display the final part of a section. | No | Yes |

## Conditionally display rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, the **Show** setting on rows defines whether they show in the report output for PDF or print.

The following table describes the different display options on a row:

| Value of the Show setting | Whether the row displays |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Yes | Row always shows. |
| No | Row never shows. Use this setting for rows that are only used in calculation steps. |
| If any column not zero | If any column in the report has a nonzero value, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |

## Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements

You can use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements. For example, after you set up your account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page, you can choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action and update the underlying financial reports for the core financial reports. The next time you run one of these reports, such as the **Balance Statement** report, new totals, and subentries are added.

Another benefit of using G/L account categories over the G/L accounts in your row definitions is that a change in your chart of accounts structure doesn't affect your financial reports.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how you can use account categories. Your chart of accounts structure and use of account categories might differ from the example.

| Row No. | Description                | Totaling Type    | Totaling    | ... | Show |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --- | ---- |
|         | // Worlds smallest balance sheet | Formula          |             |     | No   |
| A       | Total assets                     | Account Category | Assets      |     | Yes  |
| L       | Total liabilities                | Account Category | Liabilities |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Underline        |             |     | Yes  |
|         | Balance                          | Formula          | A+L         |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Double underline |             |     | Yes  |

> [!NOTE]
> The top-level account categories, such as the **Liabilities** node, are fixed, and you can't add your own. However, you can delete and add account categories at lower levels and define how the related financial report displays.
>
> You should create and structure your own lower-level G/L account categories from scratch, in a hierarchy if needed, rather than try to rearrange the existing ones. For example, you can restructure the **Liabilities** node to contain a new **Equity** node followed by the **Current Liabilities** and **Long Term Liabilities** nodes. Learn more at [Mapping general ledger accounts to account categories](finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Find the reports that use a row definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a row definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with row definitions

Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with row definitions:

* If you add row definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the row definition for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with financial reporting and perhaps changing the row definition.
* Use the **Where-Used** action to learn where a row definition is used before you make any changes to it.
* Before you change a row definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export row definitions](#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions).
* If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial reporting row definitions

You can import and export financial row definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a RAPIDSTART file that compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import row definitions, the records replace existing records with the same names. It doesn't overwrite existing row or column definitions that the report definition uses.

To import or export financial report row definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Row Definitions**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, then choose the **Import Row Definition** or **Export Row Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automated workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to recurring problems.

## Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

### Possible cause

Currently, there's a limit on how many records a flow can process. If more than 1000 records are created or changed within 30 seconds, the flow isn't triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. Learn more at [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions#notes-for-power-automate-flows) in the Developer and Admin help.

## "The response from the Business Central service is too large" error

### Problem

When using an action that interacts with records (such as *Create record (V3)* and *Get record (V3)*), Power Automate might display an error similar to this one:

`The response from the Business Central service is too large`

### Possible cause

Even though Business Central has no set limit on the size of records returned by APIs, the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector for Power Automate can handle only records up to 8 MB.

All the Business Central APIs provided by Microsoft return records under this limit, but APIs provided by partners might not. If you see an error "The response from the Business Central service is too large," reach out to the partner who created the API you're using.

## "Entity set not found" error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to this one:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate for approvals requires certain page and codeunit objects to be published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services. But in some cases, your environment might have been customized so these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

| Object Type | Object ID | Object Name | Service Name |
|--|--|--|--|
| Codeunit | 1544 | WorkflowWebhookSubscription | WorkflowActionResponse |
| Page | 6408 | workflowCustomers | workflowCustomers |
| Page | 6406 | workflowGenJournalBatches | workflowGenJournalBatches |
| Page | 6407 | workflowGenJournalLines | workflowGenJournalLines |
| Page | 6409 | workflowItems | workflowItems |
| Page | 6405 | Purchase Document Line Entity | workflowPurchaseDocumentLines |
| Page | 6404 | workflowPurchaseDocuments | workflowPurchaseDocuments |
| Page | 6403 | Sales Document Line Entity | workflowSalesDocumentLines |
| Page | 6402 | workflowSalesDocuments | workflowSalesDocuments |
| Page | 6410 | workflowVendors | workflowVendors |
| Page | 831 | workflowWebhookSubscriptions | workflowWebhookSubscriptions |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.

# Set up sustainability features

To use the sustainability features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Role Center  

If your primary responsibilities involve sustainability processes, we recommend that you use the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center. It gives easy access to the core features of sustainability, and the finance and procurement processes. It also shows the most important sustainability-related key performance indicators (KPIs).

To configure the Role Center, follow the steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **My settings**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Role** field, select the **Available Roles** page.
3. Choose **Sustainability Manager**.
4. Select **OK**.

## Sustainability setup  

Specify some general settings for sustainability, such as the unit of measure for emissions, the decimal places for amounts, and whether some fields are mandatory.

To configure these settings, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the required fields that are related to sustainability.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register emissions. |
    | **Waste Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the the waste unit of measure code that you use to register waste intensity. |
    | **Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the water unit of measure code that you use to register water intensity. |
    | **Disch. Into Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register discharged into water. |
    | **Emission Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for emission amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, means that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places are shown for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Country/Region Mandatory** | Make the country/region field mandatory. You can set the country/region field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the country/region field before posting. |
    | **Responsibility Center Mandatory** | Make the responsibility center mandatory. The responsibility center can be used as a facility, so that you can measure facility-based emissions. You can set the responsibility center field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the responsibility center field before posting. |
    | **Block Calculation Foundation Change If Ledger Entries Exist** | Prevent changes to the calculation foundation (formula) at the account category level when the formula was already applied to sustainability entries. |
    | **Enable Background Error Check** | Enable validations for sustainability journal lines. The validations run in the background. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you turn on or turn off validations in journals, sign in again before you start the new setup.

3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields that are required to use sustainability features in the purchase process.  

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** | Enable sustainability related fields and features to appear on purchase documents, such as **Sustainability Account** or different emissions. |
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable posting of **Sustainability Value Entries** through value chain operations and the visibility of sustainability related fields in operational documents and journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default **Sustainability Account** on the **G/L Account** card page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item** card page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item Charge** (currently not operating) page. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Specifies the enablement of default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** field makes the **Sustainability Account** and emission fields on purchase documents. However, when you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates **Sustainability Ledger Entries**. To activate posting to the **Sustainability Value Entries** and enable value chain tracking, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field.

4. On the **Calculations** FastTab, configure the required fields for the formulas that calculate emissions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Fuel/Electricity Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for fuel/electricity amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Distance Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for distance measurements. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Custom Amount Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for custom amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |

5. On the **Reporting** FastTab, complete the setup by configuring the fields that are related to reporting to authorities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In version 24.0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support reporting to any authorities. The fields that are related to the configuration of this functionality on the **Reporting** FastTab are intended for future reporting capabilities. However, partners can also use these fields in localized versions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Reporting Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to report emissions. You can use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. This field isn't applicable to the standard reports. |
    | **Reporting UOM Factor** | Enter the unit of measure factor that you use to register emissions, if you use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Precision** | Enter the size of the interval that you use to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Type** | Choose how to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |

## Emission fees

To track internal carbon fees or calculate your emissions using carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, configure the **Emission Fees** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission you want to configure: **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**. This field is mandatory.
3. Specify the **Scope Type**. If you leave this field blank, it applies to all scopes, but you can configure it for each scope.  
4. Specify a **Starting Date** and **Ending Date**. These dates let you use different configurations for different periods.
5. The **Country/Region Code** and **Responsibility Code** are optional fields that you can use if you want to have different carbon fees or carbon equivalent factors per country/region or per facility (responsibility center).
6. The **Carbon Fee** field represents the internal carbon fee that a company charges itself for each unit of CO2 equivalent that it emits. You can use this field based on some local or regional regulations, or for internal calculations. The **Carbon Fee** is calculated every time you post emissions. This information displays on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, without more posting to the **G/L Ledger**. You can set up **Carbon Fee** per unit of measure that you have in the **Sustainability Setup**, and you can fill this field only for the line where the **Emission Type** is **CO2**.
7. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential. If the **Emission Type** is CO2, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always *1* and you can't modify this value because CO2 is the reference gas used for calculating the global warming potential (GWP) of other GHGs. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to *1*. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.
To calculate the carbon equivalent factor, use the following example. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to add is 0.00336.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** isn't calculated based on the **CO2 Emission** values. Instead, as a foundation for this formula, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **CO2e Emission** field. The **CO2e Emission** field is calculated based on all emissions posted to an entry. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is configured for each of the gases on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!TIP]
> To use CO2e for all emissions (*CO2e of CO2*, *CO2e of CH4*, and *CO2e of N2O*), set the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** to **1** for the **CO2**, **CH4**, and **N2O** options. This setting gives you CO2e for all emissions, and the **CO2e** field displays the total carbon equivalent.  

If you didn't configure the **Emission Fees** before you posted sustainability entries, and you want to calculate your carbon fees and CO2e retroactively, run the **Calculate Emission Fees** action to update values on the sustainability ledger entries.  

## Responsibility Center

Use the **Responsibility Center** to post entries related to sustainability, where it represents a specific facility. However, if you want to use water management in sustainability, configure some additional information. You can set up your responsibility center as usual, and fill in the fields on the **Sustainability** FastTab as described in the following table.  

| Field | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Water Capacity Dimension** | Specifies the capacity dimension. For example, Area or Volume. |
| **Water Capacity Quantity (Month)** | Indicates the total water capacity quantity of the responsibility center. |
| **Water Capacity Unit** | Specifies the unit of measure that describes capacity quantity. |

[Learn more about chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md).

### Help with fields

Copilot can help you understand the purpose and typical use of individual fields. When you choose **Ask Copilot** in a tooltip for a field, chat opens with an Explain prompt for the field name and Copilot provides information about it. Copilot links to the articles it referenced, so you can verify the description.

## In-product tips

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)] These links can also access content from other websites, such as the websites of providers of any apps that are part of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner) gives you access to a Help pane that can help you find answers to your questions. The Help pane has different content, depending on how you access it. The following list describes the cards that are always, or nearly always, present:  

[!INCLUDE [ua-help-pane-links-default](includes/ua-help-pane-links-default.md)]

The following list describes how you can access the Help pane and whether cards are added to it:

- Choose the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner)
- Use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut from anywhere in Business Central.
- Choose the *Learn more* link on a tooltip for a field, if available. The *Learn more* link is only available in the mobile app or on custom fields (that is, fields from non-Mocrosoft extensions) in the web client.

> [!TIP]
> When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to un-dock the browser tab, then, so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

## Search in the Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

Use the search field at the top of the Help pane to search for guidance about how to use the product, built-in capabilities, and available training modules. Depending on your search terms, the pane shows five or more links with a short description. Choose a link, or refine your search terms. When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to undock the browser tab so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the current version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the search field in the Help pane only applies to content that is published to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) on Microsoft Learn.

## Help & Support page

From the Help pane, you can access the **Help & Support** page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that includes helpful links. You can also see how you can contact technical support for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

This section outlines the resources available to you in the different sections of the **Help and Support** page as outlined in the following list:

- [Find answers](#find-answers)  
- [Help](#product-help)  
- [Community](#community)  
- [Blog](#blog)  
- [Capabilities coming soon](#capabilities-coming-soon)  
- [Do more with your trial](#do-more-with-your-trial)  
- [Give feedback](#give-feedback)  
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)  
- [Report a problem](#report-a-problem)  
- [Support contacts](#support-contacts)  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Find answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can configure some of the links, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the [landing page on Microsoft Learn](index.yml) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described in the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) Learn more in the [Learn more using the product documentation](#learn-more-using-the-product-documentation) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/product/dynamics-365-business-central/), including any special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to the Microsoft commercial marketplace where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners. Use the links to explore the full capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you decide if you want to buy a subscription. You can also find a link to contact the sales team.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online trial experiences. If you already bought [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the section isn't longer visible.

### Give feedback

Periodically, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] team gathers feedback from our users about how satisfied they are with the product. In addition to ratings, you can also provide a written comment. By giving us specific and actionable comments, you help our engineering teams to prioritize the product improvements we invest in. You can also consent to be contacted about your comment. If you do, you're invited to a Teams meeting at a time that's convenient for you. You can provide product suggestions at any time on our [Dynamics 365 Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website.  

### Product suggestions

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website, you can provide suggestions for new features and capabilities. Your input goes directly into Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. There's a chance that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. Learn more in [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the extra telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)  
- [Managing environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments)  
- [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview)  
- [Enable sending telemetry to Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights)  

### Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner helps you with technical support. This section makes it easy for you to contact your reselling partner, if they submit their support contact details. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

Learn more in [Escalating support issues to Microsoft](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#escalating-support-issues-to-microsoft) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Report a Problem** section is only available if you have paid for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you don't have a reselling partner, and you can't contact the Microsoft support team. You can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page.

>
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, this section is only available in 2020 release wave 2 (version 18) and later.

### Support contacts

The **Report a problem** section displays an email address or a hyperlink for you to get in contact with the customer support person or team, like: Do you need technical support? Contact support at `someone@example.com` or `https://www.contoso.com`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If support contact details aren't present, it means that your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner hasn't provided the information. As a reslling partner, you set up the preferred support contact details in the admin center. Learn more in [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Learn more using the product documentation

A large community of partners extend and customize the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](index.yml) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following content:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](welcome.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](welcome.md) of Microsoft Learn hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following list:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel shows the table of contents that groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries/regions that Microsoft supports. If you don’t see your country/region listed there, it’s probably because a partner localizes your country/region. Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the specific country/region version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the learn.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country/region, for example.

### Find other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on Microsoft Learn:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link, you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site then searches all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on Microsoft Learn from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on Microsoft Learn.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you can't read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country or region that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of Microsoft Learn (`https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

On Microsoft Learn, each article shows a pane with links to other articles. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

With Microsoft Learn, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The **This product** button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigate to other parts of the site

Microsoft Learn hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

# Collect payments with SEPA Direct Debit

With your customer's consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer's bank account according to the SEPA format.  

First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer's payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journals** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## How to set up SEPA Direct Debit

From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account according to the SEPA Direct Debit format.

> [!NOTE]
> The global version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format only. Your country/region version may support other formats for electronic payment. See under **Local Functionality** in the table of contents.  

To enable export of a bank file format that aren't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer's payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.

## Creating SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection, which holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate.

    |**From Due Date**|Specify the earliest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**To Due Date**|Specify the latest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**Partner Type**|Specify if the direct-debit collection is made for customers of type **Company** or **Person**.|  
    |**Only Customers With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is created for customers who have a valid direct-debit mandate. **Note:**  A direct-debit collection is created even if the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field isn't filled on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Only Invoices With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is only created for sales invoices if a valid direct-debit mandate is selected in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Bank Account No.**|Specify which of your company's bank accounts the collected payment will be transferred to from the customer's bank account.|  
    |**Bank Account Name**|Specifies the name of the bank account that you select in the **Bank Account No.** field. This field is filled automatically.|  

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.  

### To export a direct-debit collection entry to a bank file

 1. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** action.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that you want to export, and then choose the **Create Direct Debit File** action.  
 3. Save the export file to the location from where you send or upload it to your electronic bank.  

      On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, the **Direct Debit Collection Status** field is changed to File Created. On the **SEPA Direct Debit Mandates** page, the **Debit Counter** field is updated with one count.  

 If the exported file can't be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry. If the exported file is successfully processed by the bank, the due payments of the involved sales invoices are automatically collected from the involved customers. In that case you can close the collection.  

### To reject a direct-debit collection entry  

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that wasn't successfully processed, and then choose the **Reject Entry** action.  

    The value in the **Status** field on the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page is changed to **Rejected**.  

### To close a direct-debit collection

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was successfully processed, and then choose the **Close Collection** action.  

    The related direct-debit collection is closed.  

 You can now proceed to post receipts of payment for the involved sales invoices. You can do this as you typically post payment receipts, such as on the **Payment Registration** page, or you can post the related payment receipts directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

## Posting SEPA Direct Debit Payment Receipts

When a direct debit collection is successfully processed by your bank, you can proceed to post receipt of the payment for the involved sales invoices. For more information, see [Create SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md#creating-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-and-export-to-a-bank-file).  

You can post the payment receipt directly from the **Direct Debit Collections** page or the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. Alternatively, you can relay the work to another user by preparing the related journal lines.  

### To post a direct-debit payment receipt from the Direct Debit Collections page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a line for a direct debit collection that has been exported to a bank file and successfully processed by the bank.
3. Choose the **Post Payment Receipts** action.  
4. On the **Post Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Direct Debit Collection No.**|Specify the direct debit collection that you want to post payment receipt for.|  
    |**General Journal Template**|Specify which general journal template to use for posting the payment receipt, such as the template for cash receipts.|  
    |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify which general journal batch to use for posting the payment receipt.|  
    |**Create Journal Only**|Select this check box if you don't want to post the payment receipt when you choose the **OK** button. The payment receipt will be prepared in the specified journal and won't be posted until someone posts the journal lines in question.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button.

# User Access Flow for Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes what happens when a user accesses Business Central data using their Microsoft 365 license for the first time. Understanding this flow allows administrators to plan their approach and configure Business Central to match their business needs.

1. First, the user’s identity is authenticated 
2. Business Central verifies that all the [minimum requirements](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#minimum-requirements) are met.
3. Business Central verifies that this user does not have a greater license, such as a Business Central license or an administrative role such as a delegated admin role. 
4. Business Central verifies whether the user is accessing data that belongs to an environment that has enabled access with Microsoft 365 licenses. 
5. The user record is provisioned in Business Central, assigning the User Group, Profile and Permission Sets defined in the Microsoft 365 license configuration page. By default, the Teams Users user group is assigned, the Employee profile is assigned, and only the Login permission set is assigned. Any other defaulting of user settings is also applied, just like a licensed Business Central user. 
6. The full Business Central security model is applied, to determine whether the user should be able to access the record, page, in the specified company and specified environment. 

If all steps succeed, the user can now view this Business Central data in Teams. The Business Central service automatically ensures read-only access and simplifies the UI. 

The user account is now registered in Business Central and can be managed like any Business Central user.

> [!NOTE]
> Steps may vary depending on any additional security configuration that you have specified in Microsoft 365 or Business Central.

# Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time

Instead of posting individual documents one by one, you can select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate posting or for batch posting according to a schedule, such as at the end of the day. This may be useful if only a supervisor can post documents created by other users or to avoid system performance issues from posting during work hours.

## To post multiple purchase orders immediately

The following procedure explains how to post multiple purchase orders immediately. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post** action.
6. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

## To batch post multiple purchase orders

The following procedure explains how to batch post purchase orders. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents where the **Batch Post** action is available.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post Batch** action.
6. On the **Batch Post Purchase Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **OK** button.
8. To view potential issues that occurred during batch posting of documents, open the **Error Message Register** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Posting of multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To set up background posting with job queues
Job queues are an effective tool to schedule the running of business processes in the background, such as when multiple users are trying to post sales orders, but only one order can be processed at a time.  

The following procedure explains how to set up background posting of sales orders. The steps are similar for purchasing.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the **Post with Job Queue** check box.
3. Choose the **Job Queue Category Code** field, and then specify the **SALESPOST** code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some jobs change the same data and should not run at the same time because that can cause conflicts. For example, background jobs for sales documents will try to modify the same data at the same time. Job queue categories help prevent these kinds of conflicts by ensuring that when one job is running, another job that belongs to the same job queue category will not run until it finishes. For example, a job that belongs to a Sales job queue category will wait until all other sales related jobs are done. You specify a job queue category on the **Background Posting** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
    >
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides job queue categories for sales, purchase, and general ledger posting. We recommend that one of these, or one that you create, is always specified. If you experience failures due to conflicts, consider setting up a category for all sales, purchase, and general ledger background posting.

    If you also want sales documents to be printed when they are posted, select the **Post & Print with Job Queue** check box on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  
    If you select **PDF** in the **Report Output Type** field, successfully posted purchase orders will be available in the **Report Inbox** part on your Role Center.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you set up a job that will post and print documents, and the printer displays a dialog box, such as a request for credentials or a warning about low printer ink, your document is posted but not printed. The corresponding job queue entry eventually times out and the **Status** field is set to **Error**. Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use a printer setup that requires interaction with the display of printer dialog boxes in conjunction with background posting.

    Next time that you post sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a job queue entry for each document and run the jobs in the background, one by one.

4. To verify that the job queue is working as expected, post a sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
    The sales order will now be added to a dedicated job queue entry, which defines when the documents are posted. 

### To view status from a sales or purchase document
If the job queue cannot post the sales order, the status is changed to **Error** and the sales order is added to the list of sales orders that the user must handle manually.
1. From the document that you have tried to post with background posting, choose the **Job Queue Status** field, which will contain **Error**.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

Alternatively, you can review on the **Job Queue Log Entries** page if the sales order was posted successfully. For more information, see the [Monitor the job queue](#monitor-the-job-queue) section.

## To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders

Alternatively, you can postpone postings for when it is convenient for your organization. For example, in your business it might make sense to run certain routines when most of the data entry for the day has concluded. You can achieve this by setting the job queue up to run various batch-posting reports, such as the **Batch Post Sales Orders**, **Batch Post Sales Invoices**, and similar reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports background posting for all sales, purchasing, and service documents.

The following procedure shows how to set the **Batch Post Sales Orders** report up to automatically post sales orders at 4 PM on weekdays.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select 296, **Batch Post Sales Orders**.

   You can also use following reports:
  
   * 900 **Batch Post Assembly Orders**
   * 497 **Batch Post Purchase Invoices**
   * 496 **Batch Post Purchase Orders**
   * 498 **Batch Post Purch. Credit Memos**
   * 6665 **Batch Post Purch. Ret. Orders**
   * 298 **Batch Post Sales Credit Memos**
   * 297 **Batch Post Sales Invoices**
   * 296 **Batch Post Sales Orders**
   * 6655 **Batch Post Sales Return Orders**
   * 6005 **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos**
   * 6004 **Batch Post Service Invoices**
   * 6001 **Batch Post Service Orders**

5. Select the **Report Request Page** check box.
6. In the **Batch Post Sales Orders** request page, define what is included during automatic posting of sales orders, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to set strict filters; otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they are not ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value *Released*, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value *..today*. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
7. Select all check boxes from **Run on Mondays** through **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter 4 PM.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Sales orders that are within defined filters will now be posted every weekday at 4 PM.

## Monitor the job queue

If you set up background posting with job queues, make it a regular task to monitor the job queue to catch any issues. You can track the status in the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

As an administrator, you can use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that you can use to identify problems. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) in the developer and administration content.

# Allocate revenue and costs to multiple general ledger accounts

This article describes how to use allocation accounts to distribute amounts on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines to different G/L accounts. You can allocate amounts through a fixed or variable distribution.  

Allocation splits a general journal line into the lines defined on the **Allocation Account** page. For example, if you split a rent expense three ways using dimensions, you'll have three lines to post for the allocation. Therefore, you'll have six G/L lines (or possibly more if you're using VAT or sales tax). Although this posts more G/L entries than you might need, it allows you to reverse individual lines instead of reversing the whole allocation.

Allocation accounts also work with deferrals. To learn more about deferrals, go to [Defer Revenues and Expenses](finance-how-defer-revenue-expenses.md).

The following table introduces the allocation methods you can use.

|Allocation Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Fixed     | When you want to split up expenses in a way that's repeated over a longer period of time, you can use a fixed allocation. A fixed allocation lets you define the allocation split. This split will only change when you change the setup on the **Allocation Account** page.        |
|Variable     | To distribute revenue or expenses based on values that change over time, use the variable allocation method. Variable allocations let you specify the sources to use to calculate the allocation percentages. This method is useful, for example, for splitting employee costs that according to varying headcounts in departments or divisions. Another example is the distributing the cost of rent based on production floor footage that might vary per production line over time. Variable allocations use a combination of dimensions and statistical accounts to determine how amounts distribute over a period of time. To learn more about statistical accounts, go to [Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts](bi-use-statistical-accounts.md). To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).        |

## Use a fixed share or percentage method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Fixed**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account** or **Bank Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.
1. In the **Share** and **Percent** fields, specify how to distribute amounts to the destination account.
  
   > [!TIP]
   > If you enter the actual amount to allocate for a fixed allocation in the **Share** field, the **Percent** field shows the percentage of the total amount.
1. Repeat this process for each account to include in the allocation.

## Use a variable method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Variable**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. In the **Breakdown Account Type** field, choose **Statistical Account**.
1. In the **Calculation Period** field, choose the period for which to distribute amounts.
1. Optional: To filter on specific global dimension values, choose the **Breakdown account balance filters** action, and then specify the filter values.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.

## Allocate amounts on the fly

You create allocation accounts to split revenue and costs for G/L accounts and bank accounts. Automating allocation can save time. However, if you want to use allocation accounts, but you don't want to create them for each G/L account, you can save even more time.

The Inherit from parent option lets you use the allocation account to split amounts for any G/L account on a line on a document or journal. In the **Account Type** field on a document or journal line, you choose a G/L account, and then choose the allocation account in the **Allocation Account No.** field. The amount on the line is split for the G/L account according to the setup in your allocation account. It's a less transparent way of allocating, but you don't have to create an allocation account specifically for the G/L account.

Ad-hoc allocations are easy to set up. Instead of specifying a bank or G/L account in the **Destination Account Type** field on the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Inherit from parent** option. Leave the **Destination Account Number** field blank. When you choose the G/L account on the document or journal line, that account is used to allocate amounts.

## Verify that amounts distribute correctly before you post them

There are a couple of ways to verify that amounts distribute correctly:

* On the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Test Allocation** action. Use the **Amount to Allocate** field to test different amounts.
* On the **General Ledger Journals** page, choose the journal, and then use the **Posting Preview** action.

## Adjust the distribution

If you find something in an allocation that you'd like to change, you can adjust the allocation before you post it.  

1. Open the document or journal that has the allocation you want to change.
1. Choose the line, and then choose the **Redistribute Account Allocations** action.
1. On the **Change Allocations** page, make your adjustment.

## Post an allocation transaction

The following steps describe how to post an allocation transaction from a general journal. The steps are the same for sales and purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Create a new line. Fill in the fields in the same way you would for any other type of general journal.
1. If you're using a fixed or variable allocation, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Allocation Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the allocation account.
1. If you're using an allocation that uses the Inherit from parent option, do the following:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the G/L account.
    1. In the **Allocation Account No.** field, choose the allocation account that's set up to use the Inherit from parent option. 
1. Choose **Post**.

# Put items away with warehouse put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table, and assumes that receiving has already happened. Learn more at [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse put-away processing and warehouse receive processing, use warehouse put-away documents to control how items are put away. When you post a warehouse receipt, source documents such as purchase, inbound transfer, or sales return orders, are updated. The quantity received is posted to the item ledger, and the lines for the received items are sent to the put-away function in the warehouse.

Depending on the value in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field on the **Location card**, the lines are either made available to the put-away worksheet or used to generate put-away documents immediately. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In addition to the standard ways to create warehouse put-aways that this article describes, you can create put-aways from the related posted warehouse receipt. This is useful if you have deleted put-away lines, or if you decide not to use the put-away worksheet, because you can create or recreate put-away instructions from the posted receipt lines.

## Zone and bin codes

At locations that are set up to use directed put-away and pick, the following settings are required to determine the best place to put the items:  

* A put-away template is set up. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).  
* The weight, cubage, and special storage requirements of the item or stock-keeping unit are defined.
* The capacity, bin type, and bin ranking are defined for the bins.  

The bin ranking is used when more than one bin matches the criteria on the put-away template. If both the put-away template criteria and the bin ranking are the same for more than one bin, the bin with the highest number is selected.

## To create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet  

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

You can create put-away documents for multiple receipts at the same time on the **Put-away Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action. The **Put-away Selection** page opens.  

    The list contains all posted receipts that are ready to be put away, including those for which put-away instructions have already been created. Documents with put-away lines that have been completely put away and registered are not shown on this list.  
3. Select the documents that you want to work on. You can work on lines from several documents at the same time.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a receipt or internal put-away document for which you've already created instructions for all lines, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] informs you that there's nothing to handle.  

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the put-away instruction. However, the same opportunities for sorting and bin ranking exist. You can recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the put-away instructions or sort in the put-away instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  
6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can delete lines, for example, if some items need to be put away in a bin that's far away from the bins for the other items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you delete lines they're only deleted from this worksheet. They aren't deleted from the put-away selection.  

7. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. The **Create Document** page opens, where you can add more information to the put-away you're creating.  

    * You can assign the put-away to a specific employee.  
    * You can sort the put-away instruction lines as you did in the worksheet or by bin ranking. When you sort according to bin ranking, the *Take* lines appear first, because most receipt bins have a 0 bin ranking. The *Place* lines appear last, starting with the bins with the lowest bin ranking. If you have structured your warehouse so bins of similar bin ranking are side by side, sorting lines in this way will save steps for warehouse employees.  
    * You can choose not to include the lines that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created when it converted a large unit of measure to smaller units of measure by selecting the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field. Learn more about breakbulk at [Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-enable-automatic-breaking-bulk-with-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).  
    * You can choose not to have the **Qty. to Handle** field automatically filled in on the put-away instructions.  
    * You can choose to print the document immediately.  

8. Choose **OK** to create the put-away.  

## To create a put-away from a posted receipt

If a location uses both put-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put-away lines, or if you use directed put-away and pick and have decided not to use the put-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put-away instructions for the posted receipt lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a posted receipt to put away.  
3. Choose the **Card** action.  

    If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates whether the receipt is partially or completely put-away.  

4. If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, choose the **Create Put-away** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.  

## To put items away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.

2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If your warehouse requires, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    You can sort the put-away lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the actions.

    If a bin code is mandatory for the locations, each receipt line becomes at least two lines in the warehouse put-away, as follows.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.

# Posting sales

Under the **Posting** menu in a sales document, you can choose between the following posting functions:

* **Post**
* **Post and New**
* **Post and Send**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post Batch**
* **Test Report**

> [!NOTE]
> For sales orders, you can also see options related to the prepayments functionality. For more information, see [Invoicing Prepayments](finance-invoice-prepayments.md).

When you have completed all the lines and entered all the information on the sales order, you can post it. This creates a shipment and an invoice.

When a sales order is posted, the customer's account, the general ledger, and the item ledger entries are updated.

For each sales order, a sales entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

For each sales order line, an item ledger entry will be created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry will be created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition to this, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

You can either post, or post and send. If you choose to post and send, a PDF file is generated that you can then send. You can also choose the **Post Batch** function, which lets you post several orders at the same time. For more information, see [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted sales lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. After this, you'll be able to see the posted entries in the various pages that contain posted entries, such as the **Cust. Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Posted Sales Shipments**, and **Posted Sales Invoices** pages.  

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Package Tracking No.** field. For more information, see [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Release and reopen sales and purchase documents

In this article, you learn how to release or reopen sales and purchase documents like an order, invoice, and quote. You release sales and purchase documents to move them to the next stage of processing before they're posted. When an order is released, it's included in all availability calculations from the expected receipt date of the items.

## Release a sales or purchase document

1. Open the document that you want to release as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Release**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Released**.

## Reopen a sales or purchase document

You can make changes to a released sales and purchase document by reopening it.

1. Open the document that you want to reopen as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Reopen**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Open**.

You can now make changes to the document before you release it again.

> [!NOTE]
> On document lines that have already been handled in the warehouse, the only change you can make is to change the quantity.

# Quote an Assemble-to-Order Sale

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

As when you sell any other type of item, you can also create a sales quote for a customized assembly item before converting it to a sales order. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular sales quote, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is an assembly quote.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all types of quotes, the quantities on assembly quotes are not used in availability, planning, or reservations.  

## To create a sales quote for an assemble-to-order item

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quote**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Create a sales quote line with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).  
3.  In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not quote a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the sales quote line.  

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, choose **Assemble to Order**, and then choose **Assemble-to-Order Lines**. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the line.  
5.  On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the quote that the customer is requesting. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket quote order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6.  When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the quote, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Sales Quote** page.  
7.  If the customer accepts the quote, then create a sales order for the quoted assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md). The linked assembly quote and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Monitor project progress and performance

The work in process (WIP) feature lets you estimate the financial value of ongoing projects in the general ledger.

As a project progresses, materials and resources are consumed and expenses incurred that you must post to the project. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing. But if you only post expenses, your financial statement is inaccurate. To track the actual value of the project, calculate WIP and post it to the general ledger. The following are the standard WIP methods:

* Cost value
* Sales value
* Recognizable cost
* Percentage of completion
* Completed contract

You can also create a WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default. Learn more at [Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md).

If you want to view the result using a different method, change the method and recalculate WIP. You can recalculate WIP as often as you like. The value isn't automatically posted to the general ledger. After you calculate WIP using the method you prefer, you can post to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this new method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects Setup**, then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

## Define a WIP method for a project

When you create a new project, you must specify which project WIP method applies. In some cases, the project WIP method you use is already set as the default.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Learn more at [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).  
3. On the **Project Card** page, in the **WIP Method** field from the **Posting** FastTab, select a WIP method from the list. If a default method is defined, you can select another option if needed.  

### Define a WIP method for a project task

You can define a WIP method for a project task, exclude project tasks from WIP calculation, or group tasks to be calculated together.

If you want to calculate WIP for each project task individually, WIP posting provides defined dimensions for the specific tasks.

The **WIP-Total** specifies project tasks you want to group together when calculating WIP and recognition. In any group of tasks, there needs to be one task that satisfies two conditions:
<!--But doesn't the parenthetical below contradict this -* if there is no total, the application sets the total for you, meaning the condition does not HAVE to be satisfied, right? Or am I missing something?-->

* **WIP-Total** is set to **Total**. If there are no project tasks with **WIP-Total** set to Total, Total is set automatically on the last project task line when WIP is calculated for the first time.
* The number in the **Project Task No.** field is the final one in the group or range of project tasks.

The following table describes the options:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **\<blank\>** | Leave blank if the project task is part of a group of tasks. |
| **Total** | Defines the range or group of tasks included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting** is included in the WIP total, unless the task's **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**. |
| **Excluded** | Applies only to a task with **Project Task Type** of **Posting**, in which case the task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated. |

In the following example, project tasks are divided into two WIP total groupings, demonstrating how the **WIP-Total** field works:

|Project task no.|Description|Project task type|**WIP-Total** field|  
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
|1000|Preparation|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1010|.    Cleaning|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1099|Total preparation|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1100|Carpeting|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1110|.    Gluing floor|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1120|.    Laying out carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1199|Total carpeting|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1200|Finish|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1210|.    Vacuum cleaning carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1299|Total finish|End-Total|**Total**|
|1300|Error correction|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1310|.    Error correction|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1399|Total error correction|End-Total|**Total**|

You notice:

* For *1000* through *1299*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks. Note, however, that two of the tasks, 1010 and 1110, are excluded from the WIP calculation because their project task type is **Posting**.
* For *1300* through *1399*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks.

## Calculate WIP

You can determine the WIP amount to post to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting by using the **Project Calculate WIP** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Calculate WIP**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
3. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job only calculates the WIP, it doesn't post it to the general ledger. To post WIP, run the **Post WIP to G/L** batch job after you've calculated the WIP. Learn more in the following procedure.

### Review warnings

If your WIP calculation results in a *WIP was calculated with warnings* message, you might want to review the warnings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to review warnings. The **WIP Warnings** toggle is enabled for projects that have WIP warnings.
3. Choose the **Show Warning** action.

### Delete WIP entries

If you want to try different WIP methods, you might get a *The Project Task cannot be modified because the project has associated project WIP entries* error. To be able to check WIP method, delete existing WIP entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to delete WIP entries.
3. Choose the **Delete WIP Entries** action.

## Post WIP

When you calculate WIP, you can post it to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting. Use the **Project Post WIP to G/L** batch job.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Post WIP to G/L**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Calculate and post project completion entries

After you complete all activities for a project, including posting usage and invoicing, you must update the project's status to **Completed**. Then, you must reverse any WIP that was posted to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select an open project, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Status** field, select **Completed**.
4. Follow the assistance steps to calculate and post the WIP, or follow steps 5 and 6 to do so manually.  
5. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP entries created by running the batch job have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.  
7. Choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.
8. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP general ledger entries created by running the batch project have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.

## View project ledger entries

All project-related entries are recorded in project registers and sequentially numbered, starting with 1. From the project register, you can get an overview of all project ledger entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Registers**, and choose the related link.
2. Select a relevant register, and then choose **Project Ledger** action.

On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, you can review the entries that are associated with any project.

# Inventory analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for inventory managers:

- Shipping of goods when sales orders are fulfilled.
- Receipts of items when purchase orders are fulfilled.
- Movements of items between locations.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's inventory data:

- Power BI reports for inventory
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in inventory analytics tools
- Built-in inventory reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your inventory.

## Analytics needs in inventory

When you think about the analytics needs in inventory management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports           |
|Inventory Manager  | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Warehouse worker   | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their core inventory performance:

- Number of Scheduled Receipt
- Number of Planned Order Receipt
- Gross Requirement
- Projected Available Balance
- Quantity on Sales Orders, Purchase Returns, Service Orders, Projects, Production Orders, or Assemply Component
- Inventory by Item/Location/Lot/Serial No.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png":::

For inventory valuation, you can use the following KPIs to monitor the value kept in your inventory:

- Ending balance inventory value
- Variance by item/location
- Invoiced Quantity
- Increases/Decreases in quantity (by item/location)

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Valuation by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-Location.png":::

All of these purchasing KPIs (and more) are available in the Inventory Power BI apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to:

- [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md)
- [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md)

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-valuation-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-valuation-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md).

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to inventory

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for inventory management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track inventory postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to inventory)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for inventory management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your inventory accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png" alt-text="Example of how to do a old stock data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png"::: -->

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on inventory data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-inventory.md).

## Built-in reports for inventory

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help inventory organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_reports_report_explorer](includes/inventory-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for inventory, go to [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md).

## On-screen inventory analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you inventory overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md)
- [Trace item-tracked items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md)
- [Audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md#to-audit-the-reconciliation-between-the-inventory-ledger-and-the-general-ledger)
- [View cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md#to-view-cross-docked-items-in-a-shipment-or-pick-worksheet)

The sales module also include analytics pages related to inventory:

- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)

### Show inventory-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for inventory management, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post inventory entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze inventory data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Manage Notifications

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you work smarter by notifying you about certain events or changes in status, such as when you are about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you are about to sell, for example. These notifications are shown as discreet tips in the context of the task you are doing, and you can choose to ignore the notification or to see details about the issue.  

If you choose to see details for a notification, you can take action to resolve the issue, such as contacting the customer, buying more inventory, and so on. It's your choice what to do, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives you advice and recommendations.  

Notifications can help untrained users complete unfamiliar tasks, and do not reduce productivity for the more trained user.  

## To turn notifications on or off, and control when they are sent

When you first start with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] all notifications are turned on, but you can turn them on or off, for example, if you aren't interested in a certain event or status.  

Additionally, some notifications let you specify the conditions under which they are sent. For example, if you want to be notified when inventory is running low, but only for items you buy from a certain vendor.  

Turning notifications on or off, and specifying conditions, applies only to you.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.  
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Notifications** field, choose the *Change when I receive notifications.* link.  
3. In the page that appears, turn on or turn off a notification by selecting or clearing the **Enabled** check box.  
4. To specify conditions that trigger a notification, choose the **View filter details** link, and then fill in the fields.

## Project Analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: view project costing performance

CFOs want to ensure that you aren't overspending on specific projects from a high-level. By analyzing the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against its budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) report to view key information on profit statics per project.

## Project analytics for project managers

To fit this category, you might have a role such as Project Manager.

### Example scenario: tracking project completion and sales

Project managers want to know how each project is performing and get high-level information about them. The [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report can help you compare key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by using either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) reports.

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Post transactions directly to the general ledger

You use general journals to post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts.  

A typical use of the general journal is to post employees expenses during business activities for reimbursement. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employee Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

General journals post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts. Entries are created even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group. You can personalize your version of a general journal by setting up a journal batch or template. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

Entries that you post with documents require a credit memo process. However, you can reverse entries that you post with the general journal. For more information, see [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

## To post a transaction directly to a general ledger account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all transactions that you want to post.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple transaction lines before a balance-account line, for example for one bank account, select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. The **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the transactions.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the transactions on the specified G/L accounts.

# Synchronizing data in Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can decide whether to synchronize data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of row, you can synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or vice versa. For more information, see [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronization uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronization rules
* Coupled records

When synchronization is set up you can couple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows to synchronize their data. You can start a synchronization manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides an overview of the ways you can synchronize.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  See  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronization|Synchronize on a row-by-row basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize individual records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] row, such as an account. This is typically how users will work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|[Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
|  |Synchronize on a table mapping basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table with an table [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table.|[Synchronize Individual Table Mappings](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
||Synchronize all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the records that have been modified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables since the last synchronization.|[Synchronizing All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronization of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are mapped, and create new records or rows in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronization synchronizes all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronization when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronization can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronization](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronization|Synchronize all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronization](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

> [!NOTE]
> The synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the scheduled execution of job queue entries and does not guarantee real time data consistency between two services. For real time data conistency you should explore [Business Central Virtual Tables](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-overview) or Business Central APIs.   

## Standard table mapping for synchronization

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

> [!TIP]
> You can reset configuration changes made to integration table and field mappings to their default settings by selecting the mappings, and then choosing **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |
| Customer | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Customer** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Customer is not blocked). |
| Vendor | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Vendor** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Vendor is not blocked). |
| Contact | Contact | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact filter: **Type** is **Person** and the contact is assigned to a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: The contact is assigned to a company and the parent customer type is **Customer**. |
| Currency | Transaction Currency | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] |  |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Dataverse** actions will not be available on pages, for example, the Customer Card page, for records that do not respect the table filter on the integration table mapping.

### Tip for admins: viewing table mappings

You can view the mapping between the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables and the columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add additional mapping logic. For example, this can be useful if you need to troubleshoot synchronization.

## Use virtual tables to get more data

When you're setting up your integration, you can use virtual tables to make more data available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], without help from a developer.

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains objects that are also called virtual tables. Those table objects are not related to the virtual tables that you use with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about virtual tables, go to the following articles:

* [Create and edit virtual tables that contain data from an external data source](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities) (Power Apps documentation)
* [Business Central Virtual Table for Microsoft Dataverse Admin Reference](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-admin-reference) ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation)

To use virtual tables, you must install the **Business Central Virtual Entity** app from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/dynamics-365/microsoftdynsmb.businesscentral_virtualentity). 

After you install the app, you can enable virtual tables from one of the following pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* When you run the **Set up Dataverse connection** assisted setup guide, you can use the **Dataverse Available Virtual Tables** page to select multiple virtual tables. Afterward, the tables are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the PowerApps Maker Portal. 
* From the **Dataverse Connection Setup**, **Virtual Tables**, and **Available Virtual Tables** pages.  
* From the Power App Maker Portal.

## Synchronize data from multiple companies or environments

You can synchronize data from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies or environments with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. In multi-company synchronization scenarios, there are several things to consider.

### Set company IDs

When you synchronize records, we set a company ID on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity to clarify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company the records came from. Integration table mappings have integration table filter fields that take the company ID into account. To include a table mapping in a multi-company setup, on the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox. The setting optimizes how integration table filter fields filter company IDs in a multi-company setup.

For integration table mappings that synchronize documents, such as orders, quotes, and opportunities, if you choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox the integration only considers entities that have the company ID of the current [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. To synchronize documents, for example, between Business Central and Sales, users in Sales must specify the company ID on the documents. Otherwise, the documents won't synchronize.  

For all other integration table mappings, choosing the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox removes the filter on company ID. The synchronization will consider related entities, regardless of their company ID.

### Specify the synchronization direction

If you enable multi-company support on an integration table mapping, we recommend that you set the direction of the mapping to **FromIntegration**. If you set the direction to **ToIntegration** or **Bidirectional**, it's a good idea to use **Table Filter** and **Integration Table Filter** to control which entities synchronize with which company. It's also a good idea to use match-based coupling to avoid creating duplicate records. To learn more about match-based coupling, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#customize-the-match-based-coupling).

### Use unique numbers

If your number series doesn't guarantee that primary key values are unique to each company, we recommend that you use prefixes. To start using prefixes, create a transformation rule on the integration field mapping. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Handle differences in field values](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#handle-differences-in-field-values).

# Set Up Service Offerings
When you set up service management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item that needs servicing, for example, the computer that needs repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Record payments and refunds in the payment journal

On the **Payment Journals** page, you record payments that you make to vendors and refunds that you make to customers. When you post a payment journal line, the paid amount is recorded on the specified bank account. You must then take steps to perform the actual money transfer from the related bank account.  

Payment journals are general journals that are optimized for making payments. You can quickly add lines manually, you can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggest vendor payments, and you can apply the payment to posted documents. Although you're making payments, you enter a positive amount in the **Document Amount** field. Depending on the document type for the journal line, this amount is then converted to a negative amount in the underlying transactions. This way, it's faster for you to add journal lines manually. If you prefer to enter negative amounts, you can personalize the payment journal to show the **Amount** field instead. To learn more about personalizing pages, go to [Start personalizing by using the personalization mode](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).  

- Applying payments to invoices or credit memos

    If you fill in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field with the invoice or credit memo to pay or refund, the document is set to **Paid** when you post the journal. This setting is referred to as "applied." As an alternative to applying when you post a payment, you can use the **Apply Vendor Entries** and **Apply Customer Entries** pages after you post the payment. To learn more, go to, for example, [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

- Get suggested payments to vendors or employees

    The **Suggest Vendor Payments** and **Suggest Employee Payments** actions can help you fill in payment journal lines automatically according to vendor prioritization and due dates. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md). With this function, the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field is always filled in.  

- Print checks and submit payments electronically to your bank

    In addition to recording that the payment is made, you can also use the **Payment Journal** page to output the payment for further processing by your bank. To learn more, go to [Make Check Payments](payables-how-work-checks.md) and [Make Electronic Payments](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

## To make payments in the payment journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal batch that you use for payments.
3. If you know who to pay, fill in the fields manually. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To also apply the payment to the related invoice or credit memo, choose the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, on the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the relevant invoice or credit memo, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Many fields, such as the **Document Amount** and **Due Date** fields, now contain information from the selected document.
5. Alternatively, use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action. All the applies-to information and amounts are also entered on the journal lines. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).
6. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post** action.

## To issue a refund check

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Document Type** field, select **Refund**.  
3. In the **External Document No.** field, enter a reference for the refund check (for example, the return order number).  
4. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.  
5. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer's account number that the refund check is being issued to.  
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be refunded.  
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.  
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account the check comes out of.  
9. In the **Applies To Doc. No.** field, select the documents that require a refund.  
10. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post/Print** action, choose the **Post and Print** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Create contacts

When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When you convert a contact to a customer, vendor, or employee, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data synchronizes going forward.

## To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

## To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).
>
>Also, you must also have at least one template set up for each of them. For example, to create a customer from a contact, you must have a customer template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronize data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritize if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

## To remove a link between a contact and an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronizes.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, employees, and bank accounts

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronize them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronization between contacts and customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## To view which customer, vendor, employee, or bank account a contact is related to

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a contact, choose the **Related Information** action, and then choose the **Customer/Vendor/Bank Account/Employee** action.

# Finding pages and reports with the role explorer

You can get an overview of the pages and reports that make up the features that people your business role often use. You can also explore what's available for other roles. This article refers to the overview of pages and reports as the *role explorer*.

In addition to the overview, the role explorer provides actions that open pages or reports, for example, so you can explore the information that the page or report includes. You can also use the role explorer as a way to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Open the role explorer

You can open the role explorer from role centers, list pages, and the **Tell Me** window.

- On your role center or any list page, choose the ![Menu button.](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button, or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring pages** action.

## Open the role explorer filtered to show reports

You can open the role explorer in a filtered view that only shows reports:

- On your role center or any list page, choose the **All Reports** action.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring reports** action.

## Open pages and reports

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes that are named after application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, or all nodes together.

- To expand/collapse an individual top-level or subnode, choose the node.
- To expand/collapse all top-level nodes on the page, but leave the subnodes as they are, choose **...** at the top, then choose **Expand** or **Collapse**.
- To expand/collapse all top-levels node and all subnodes under it, choose **...** at the top, then choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action.

## Search for pages and reports

To quickly locate a page or report, select **Find**, and then enter a word or phrase for what you want to find. Role explorer highlights any matching text. If the page or report is hidden in a collapsed node, the collapsed node is marked with a dot.

## Explore other roles

To explore roles other than your own, select **Explore more roles**. Role explorer displays each role under its own heading, with links to its features. You can find and go to features just like you do when exploring your role.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only access roles that are set up to show in the role explorer. If a role isn't available, it probably isn't set up to show. To learn more, go to [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

When you explore other roles, you can also narrow down your exploration by using the **Report & Analysis** and **Administration** actions.

- **Report & Analysis** filters the role explorer to show only reports and analysis features.
- **Administration** filters the role explorer to show only pages for administrative tasks, such as pages related to how you set up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> For developers, you categorize pages and reports by setting the [UsageCategory property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-usagecategory-property) in the object's AL code.
<!--
 
## Role explorer actions

There a several actions along the top of the role explorer to help you locate features of your role and other roles.

|Action|Description|
|------|------|
|**All**|Shows all features that are related to the role.|
|**Find**|Lets you enter a word or phrase to quickly locate feature names that match.|
|**Explore more roles**|All business features that are available for all roles including your own. When exploring all roles, the other actions work the same way, except for all roles shown. **NOTE:** You can only access roles that are set up to show in role explorer. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).  |
|**Report & Analysis**|This action Shows only those features that are categorized as reports and analysis features.|
|**Administration**|Shows only those features that are categorized as administration features.|

<!--
Choose the **Find** action at the top of the role explorer to quickly locate feature names that contain a certain term.

Choose the **Explore more roles** action at the top of the role explorer to get an overview of all business features that are available for all roles including your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Role Center actions for profiles where the **Show in Role Explorer** check box is selected will appear on the extended version of the role explorer (shown with the **Explore more roles** action). For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).
-->

## Expand and collapse nodes

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes named after the features or application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, and you can collapse or expand all nodes.

- To expand or collapse a top-level or subnode, choose the node.
- To expand or collapse all top-level nodes on the page, choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action.
- To expand or collapse all top-level nodes and their subnodes:
  - Select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> keys while you choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action.
  - Choose **...**, and then choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action.

## Learn more about a page or report

[!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

Teaching tips are available for some pages and reports. When that's the case, when you hover over the action for the page or report an information icon displays next to the name. Select the icon to learn more about the page or report.

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-more-information.png" alt-text="Example of how the more information window is shown on an element on the role explorer." lightbox="media/report-explorer-more-information.png":::

## Explore a page or report

[!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

You can open the pages or reports in a new window while keeping the role explorer open. To explore an element, choose the **Open in a new window** icon to the left of the element's name. If the page or report has a teaching tip, the tip contains the **Open in a new window** icon.

# Work with dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts. Learn more at [Business Intelligence](bi.md).

Another example is to set up a dimension called *Department*, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items. The more dimensions you use, the more detailed are the reports you base your business decisions on. In fact, a single sales entry can include information from multiple dimensions, such as:  

* The account the item sale was posted to.  
* Where the item was sold.
* Who sold it.
* Which customer bought it.

## Analyze by dimensions

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence, such as when defining analysis views. Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

> [!TIP]
> A quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions is to use the **Set Dimension Filter** action to filter totals by dimensions in the chart of accounts and on pages for entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Analysis views often use data from dimensions. If you discover an incorrect dimension has been used on posted general ledger (G/L) entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. This helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate. Learn more at [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Dimension sets

A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. They're stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. In addition, each dimension set, and dimension set entry within it, is identified by a common dimension set ID.  

When you create a journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

## Set up dimensions

You can define dimensions and dimension values to categorize journals and documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders. You set up dimensions on the **Dimensions** page, where you create one line for each dimension, such as *Project*, *Department*, *Area*, and *Salesperson*.

You also set up values for dimensions. Let's say values represent your company's departments. Dimension values can be set up in a hierarchical structure similar to the chart of accounts. That means data can be broken down into various levels of granularity, and subsets of dimension values can be totaled. You can define as many dimensions and dimension values as you need, and everyone in your company can use them.

When dimensions and values are set up, you can define global and shortcut dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. These dimensions are then always available for you to select as fields on journal and document lines, and ledger entries, without opening the **Dimensions** page first. Learn more in the [To set up global and shortcut dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-global-and-shortcut-dimensions) section.

* **Global Dimensions** are used as filters, for example, on reports, batch jobs, and XMLports. You can use only two global dimensions, so choose dimensions you'll use often.
* **Shortcut Dimensions** are available as fields on journals, document lines, and ledger entries. You can create up to eight of these.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a new dimension in any entry, such as a line or new record, you cannot delete the dimension, even if you do not post the entry. This is because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately creates a dimension set for the line or record. Learn more in the [Dimension Sets](finance-dimensions.md#dimension-sets) section.

### To set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts

You can assign a default dimension for a specific account. The dimension is copied to the journal or document when you enter the account number on a line, but you can delete or change the code on the line if appropriate. You can also require a dimension for posting an entry in a specific type of account. > 

> [!NOTE]
> Default dimension priorities open up for scenarios in sales and purchases that you might want to pay special attention to. When you use default dimension priorities on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always considers the dimensions in the header as coming from the customer or vendor. This is true for dimensions that you set manually or by default, and is especially relevant when you use default dimensions on locations and items but not on customers or vendors.
>
> **Example**
>
> You have a scenario with the following dimension settings:
>
> * A customer without default dimensions
> * An item with ADM as the dimension value for the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * A location with PROD as the dimension value the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * Default dimension priorities are set as Customer > Item > Location
>
> When you create a new document in this scenario, dimensions are used as follows:
>
> * If you create a new document and add a location, the default value for new lines will be PROD. When you add lines with items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will keep PROD because it comes from the header of the document.
>
> * If you create a new document and add items that have the ADM dimension value, and then specify a location in the header of the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to overwrite the existing lines because there's a conflict.
>
> We recommend that you to test your default dimensions setup, dimension priorities, and the order in which you enter data in documents.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimensions**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimensions** page, select the relevant dimension, then choose the **Account Type Default Dim** action.  
3. Fill in a line for each new default dimension you want to set up. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you want to require a dimension but don't want to assign a default value to the dimension, leave the **Dimension Value Code** field blank, then select **Code Mandatory** in the **Value Posting** field.  

> [!WARNING]  
> If an account is used in an **Adjust Exchange Rates** or **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, do not select **Code Mandatory** or **Same Code**. These batch jobs cannot use dimension codes.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an account must have a different dimension than the default dimension assigned to the account type, you must set up a new default dimension for the account. The default dimension for the account then replaces the default dimension for the account type.  

### To set up default dimension priorities

Different account types, such as a customer account and an item account, can have different default dimensions. As a result, an entry might have more than one  proposed default dimension. To avoid such conflicts, you can apply priority rules to the different sources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Dimension Priorities**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, in the **Source Code** field, enter the source code for the entry table to which the default dimension priorities will apply.  
3. Fill in a line for each default dimension priority you want for the selected source code.
4. Repeat the procedure for each source code you want to set up default dimension priorities for.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you set up two tables with the same priority for the same source code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always selects the table with the lowest table ID.  

### To set up dimension combinations

To avoid posting entries with contradictory or irrelevant dimensions, you can block or limit specific combinations of two dimensions. A blocked dimension combination means you can't post both dimensions on the same entry regardless of what the dimension values are. In contrast, a limited dimension combination means you can post both dimensions to the same entry, but only for certain combinations of dimension values.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimension Combinations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimension Combinations** page, choose the dimension combination field you want from the following options.  

    |Field|Description|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No limitation**|This dimension combination has no restrictions. All dimensions values are allowed.|  
    |**Limited**|This dimension combination has restrictions depending on which dimension values that you enter. You must define the limitations on the **Dimension Value Combination** page.|  
    |**Blocked**|This dimension combination isn't allowed.|  

3. If you selected the **Limited** option, you must define which combinations of dimension values are blocked. To do this, choose the field to define the dimension value combination.  
4. Now select a dimension value combination that is blocked and enter **Blocked** in the field. A blank field means the dimension value combination is allowed. Repeat if multiple combinations are blocked.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The same dimensions are displayed in both rows and columns, meaning all dimension combinations appear two times. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically displays the setting in both fields. You cannot select anything in the fields from the upper-left corner and down, because those fields have the same dimension in both rows and columns.  
>
> The selected option is not visible before you exit the field.  
>
> To show the name of the dimensions instead of the code, select the **Show Column Name** field.

### To set up global and shortcut dimensions

Global and shortcut dimensions can be used as filters in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], including on reports, batch jobs, ledger entry pages, and analysis views. Global and shortcut dimensions can be inserted directly without first opening the **Dimensions** page. On journal and document lines, you can select global and shortcut dimensions in a field on the line. You can set up two global dimensions and eight shortcut dimensions. Choose the dimensions that you use most frequently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a global or shortcut dimension requires all entries posted with the dimension be updated. To change a global dimension, you can use the **Change Global Dimensions** function, but that can be time-consuming, may affect performance, and tables may be locked during the update. Make sure you choose your global and shortcut dimensions carefully so you won't have to change them later. To change a shortcut dimension, use the **Change Dimensions** action.
>
> Learn more in the [To change global dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-change-global-dimensions) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add or change a global or shortcut dimension, you are automatically signed out and back in so the new value is prepared for use.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### To change global dimensions

When you change a global or shortcut dimension, all entries posted with that dimension are updated. Because this process may be time-consuming and can affect performance, two different modes are provided to adapt the process to the size of the database.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Change Global Dimensions** action.
3. At the top of the page, select one of the following two modes for running the batch job.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |**Sequential**|(Default) The change is done in one transaction that reverts all entries to the dimensions they had before the change.<br /><br />This option is recommended if the company has relatively few posted entries, in which case the batch job takes the shortest time to complete. The process locks multiple tables and blocks other users until it's done. Note that with large databases, the process might not complete in this mode. In that case, use the **Parallel** option.|
    |**Parallel**|The dimension change happens in multiple background sessions and the operation is split into multiple transactions. To use this option, turn on the **Parallel Processing** toggle. <br /><br />We recommended this option for large databases or companies with numerous posted entries because it will complete in the shortest time. Note that in this mode, the update process won't start if there's more than one active database session.|  

4. In the **Global Dimension 1 Code** and/or **Global Dimension 2 Code** fields, enter the new dimension(s). The current dimensions are displayed in gray behind the fields.
5. Depending on the mode, do one of the following:
    * In **Sequential** mode, choose the **Start** action.
    * In **Parallel** mode, choose the **Prepare** action.

    The **Log Entries** tab is filled with information about the dimensions to be changed.
6. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then sign in again.
7. Choose the **Start** action to begin the parallel processing of the dimension changes.

### Example of dimension setup

Let's say your company wants to track transactions based on organizational structure and geographic locations. To do that, you set up two dimensions on the **Dimensions** page:

* **AREA**  
* **DEPARTMENT**  

| Code | Name | Code Caption | Filter Caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AREA |Area |Area Code |Area Filter |
| DEPARTMENT |Department |Department Code |Department Filter |

For **AREA**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 |Americas |Begin-Total |
| 20 |North America |Standard |
| 30 |Pacific |Standard |
| 40 |South America |Standard |
| 50 |Americas, Total |End-Total |
| 60 |Europe |Begin-Total |
| 70 |EU |Standard |
| 80 |Non-EU |Standard |
| 90 |Europe, Total |End-Total |

For the two main geographic areas, Americas and Europe, you add subcategories for regions by indenting the dimension values. This lets you report on sales or expenses in regions, and get totals for the larger geographic areas. You could also choose to use countries, regions, counties, or cities as your dimension values, depending on your business.

> [!NOTE]  
> To set up a hierarchy, the codes must be in alphabetical order. This includes the codes of the dimension values provided in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For **DEPARTMENT**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADMIN |Administration |Standard |
| PROD |Production |Standard |
| SALES |Sales |Standard |

With this setup, you can add your two dimensions as the two global dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This means you can use AREA and DEPARTMENT as filters for general ledger entries, as well as on all reports. Both global dimensions are also automatically available for use on entry lines and document headers as shortcut dimensions.

## Getting an overview of dimensions used multiple times

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page specifies how a group of accounts uses dimensions and dimension values. You can set this up by highlighting multiple accounts, then specifying default dimensions and dimension values for them. After that, the application suggests these dimensions and dimension values whenever one of these accounts is used, such as on a journal line. This makes entry posting easier for the user, as the dimension fields are filled in automatically. Also note, however, that the dimension values suggested can be changed on, for example, a journal line.

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Dimension Code**|Shows all dimensions defined as default dimensions on one or more highlighted accounts. By choosing this field, you can see a list of all available dimensions. If you select a dimension, that dimension is defined as a default dimension for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Dimension Value Code**|Shows either a single dimension value or the term (Conflict). If a dimension value is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. Upon choosing the **Dimension Code** field, you'll see a list of all available dimension values for a dimension. If you select a dimension value, it will be defined as a default dimension value for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Value Posting**|Shows either a single value posting rule or the term (Conflict). If a value posting rule is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all the highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. Upon choosing the **Value Posting** field, you'll see a list of value posting rules for a dimension. If you select a value posting rule, it will be applied to all highlighted accounts.|

## Use dimensions

In a document such as a sales order, you can add dimension information for both an individual document line and the document itself. So on the **Sales Order** page, you could enter dimension values for the first two shortcut dimensions on the individual sales lines, then add more dimension information if you choose the **Dimensions** button.  

If you work in a journal instead, you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way, if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines.  

You can also set up default dimensions for accounts or account types, so dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically.

### To view global dimensions in ledger entry pages

Global dimensions are always company-defined and company-named. To see the global dimensions for your company, open the **General Ledger Setup** page.

In a ledger entry page, you can see whether there are global dimensions for the entries. The two global dimensions differ from your other dimensions because you can use them as filters anywhere in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**,  then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. To see only entries that are relevant, set one or more filters on the page.  
4. To see all the dimensions for an entry, select the entry, then choose the **Dimensions** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page displays the dimensions one ledger entry at a time. You'll see as you scroll through the ledger entries, the content on the **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page changes accordingly.

# Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

## Use G/L account categories

You create the first layer of a financial report by selecting an account category for each general ledger account. There are six categories:

* Assets
* Liabilities
* Equity
* Income
* Cost of Goods
* Expense

You specify categories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the major sections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports.  

:::image type="content" source="media/account categories financial reporting.png" alt-text="Shows the G/L account categories page.":::

## Use account subcategories

You can also create subcategories for each account. Subcategories help add more details to the mapping for accounts in each category. You also specify subcategories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the subsections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports. Subcategories are more flexible than categories because you can define them. 

:::image type="content" source="media/account subcategories.png" alt-text="Shows account subcategories."::: 

## Map general ledger accounts

The most important feature of the financial reports that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides is the mapping between G/L accounts and account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page. All accounts in the chart of accounts should be listed in a selected category and subcategory, so when you generate financial reports you include all mapped accounts. To learn more about mapping categories, go to the examples in [Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports](bi-examples-custom-financial-reports.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/account mapping.png" alt-text="Shows accounts mapped to G/L account categories.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the mapping only in the United States. If you're using another country version, you must create the mapping yourself. The mapping will become available in more country versions in future releases.

## Generate financial reports

After you set up categories and subcategories have and map all accounts on the chart of accounts, choose **Generate Financial Reports**. This action updates financial reports with the M- prefix with the mapping provided for your chart of accounts.  

To control which reports update when you generate financial reports, update the fields in the **Reporting** section of the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

You can remap and update these reports at any time. If you choose to regenerate them, you can choose to keep the original reports and create copies with the new mapping.

## Audit changes to account categories

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L account categories. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L account categories and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account Category | 570 |

# Power BI Sales app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The reports in the Power BI Sales app provide comprehensive sales analytics to stakeholders at all levels of your organization.

Executives and the leadership team can use the [Sales Overview](sales-powerbi-sales-overview.md), [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md), and [Month-To-Date](sales-powerbi-month-to-date.md) reports to identify trends in sales performance.

Managers and team leaders can track individual sales team performance using the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report. They can also monitor overall team progress toward meeting sales goals by comparing actual results against targets in the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md)  report.

Sales teams can use aggregated reports, such as the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports, to identify top-selling items and the customers that generate the most revenue. You can drill down from these aggregated views into transaction-level data for more detailed analyses.

You can use the reports in the Power BI Sales app for different things, depending on your role. This article provides some examples of use cases for different roles in your organization.

## Sales analytics for the leadership team

The leadership team can use the app to gain a high-level overview of the organization's sales trends and financial health. The app helps leaders identify spending patterns, monitor budget adherence, and make strategic decisions to improve financial performance. It provides a clear picture of sales efficiency and highlights areas for potential cost reduction.

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Example scenario: preparing for an upcoming board meeting

Imagine you're the CEO of a company, and you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting. You need to present an analysis of your company's sales performance for the current fiscal year. To better understand the company's current position, you can use the Power BI Sales app.

Start by reviewing the [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md) report, which provides a quick, comparative view of the current year versus the previous year. Sales are up by 35%, outlined by the [Sales Amount MATG % (Fiscal)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) metric shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Period-Over-Period Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png":::

Next, you review the [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) report to identify which group of customers contributed most to sales. The **Sales by Customer** matrix shows that domestic customers outperformed foreign customers by contributing 56.59% to the total annual sales, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png":::

Finally, you review the [Moving Averages](sales-powerbi-moving-average.md) report, which visualizes [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount) and [Sales Amount Average 30D](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-avg-30d-fiscal). The 30 day average smooths out the sales trend for the year and provides more good news for the company. On average, sales were stable through the first half of the year and then increased through the second half of the year.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Moving Average Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png":::

The insights you gained from this report let you confidently present your organization's sales performance to the board, armed with data-driven analysis and a deeper understanding of your company's current position.

## Sales analytics for the management team

The goal of the sales management team is to effectively oversee and manage sales processes. <!--This app allows you to track -->

To fit this category, your job title might be:

- Sales Manager
- Sales Team Leader

### Example scenario: driving sales over the next two quarters

As a Sales Manager, you're tasked with driving sales over the next two quarters. You turn to the Power BI Sales app to understand the sales team's current standing.

Start by reviewing the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report to evaluate individual team performance. You quickly identify Jim Olive as the top performer, generating 83% of the total sales for the year. You also see that Helena Ray was the most profitable salesperson on the team, but only by a small margin.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png":::

You know that clear targets help Lina and Helena reach their maximum potential. By establishing a new sales budget with revised targets for each salesperson, you can provide your team with the tools they need to progress. Using the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report, you monitor progress to ensure the team is on track to meet their new goals.

The [Daily Sales](sales-powerbi-daily-sales.md) report lets you monitor the team's progress over the next two quarters. You can use the heat map to gauge which day of the week the team performs best, and when the company should roll out marketing incentives to help drive customer engagement.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales-heat-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the heatmap in the Daily Sales Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales-heat-map.png":::

## Sales analytics for daily sales work

People who work with sales on a daily basis often focus on handling day-to-day sales tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

To fit this category, you might have a job title such as:

- Account Manager
- Sales Person

### Example scenario: using data to drive day-to-day sales

After the sales team receives the new sales targets from the sales manager, they're eager to improve their performance and meet the revised goals. To shape an effective strategy as a salesperson, you turn to the Power BI Sales app for insights into the company's sales patterns.

Start by analyzing the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports to identify high-potential products and key customers. These aggregated reports provide a clear view of where opportunities lie. That information helps you focus on the customers and items most likely to generate growth and help your team achieve their targets.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix version 2" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png":::

The [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) report highlights product performance by clearly identifying which items generate the most revenue and, conversely, which items experienced a decline in sales. Targeting key products lets you and your team prioritize your efforts on highly profitable items and items with growing demand.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Item matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item-matrix.png":::

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.
    - ![Connectivity check failed.](media/connectivity-failed.png) indicates the check failed. Review the message below the check for more details.
    - ![Connectivity check was not run.](media/connectivity-blocked.png) indicates the check wasn't run, typically because of a failure of a previous check. Review the message below the check for more details.

4. To run the check again, choose **Restart check**.

The following sections explain the checks that are run, and provide some tips for fixing any problems.

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Couple and Synchronize Records between Dataverse and Business Central

This topic describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator has created a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376]

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer or Contact card.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer or Contact card.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can be synchronized in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account card or Contact card form.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple record automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. For more information, see [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. For more information, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can be synchronized in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have a large number of Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

You'll use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel. <!--Don't they need to choose the customers that they want to import to Dataverse?-->
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Scroll to the right, and choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and Business Central records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. 

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.

# View the Status of Synchronization Jobs


Use the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page to view the status of synchronization jobs that have been run for coupled records in a Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integrations. This includes jobs that were run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that ran on records from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, viewing their status is helpful when troubleshooting because it gives you access to details about errors related to coupled records. Typically, these types of errors are caused by user actions, for example, when:  

* Two people made a change to the same data in both business apps.
* Someone deleted data in one of the apps, but not both.

> [!Note]
> The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows information about jobs related to coupled records. If you resolve all of the errors but records are still not synchronizing, it might have something to do with a setting for the integration. Typically, your administrator will need to resolve those types of errors.   

## Example
This video shows an example of how to troubleshoot errors that happened while synchronizing with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The process will be the same for all integrations. 

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2097304]


## To view and resolve synchronization errors for coupled records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows issues that occurred when you synchronized coupled records. The following table includes actions that you can use to resolve issues one by one:

|Action|Description|
|----|----|
|**Remove Coupling**|Uncouples the records and they will no longer synchronize. To restart the synchronization you must couple them again. |
|**Retry** and **Retry All**|For each record where an error is found, synchronization is skipped unless you fix the issue. Retry will include the selected record in the next synchronization, and **Retry All** includes all of the records.|
|**Synchronize**|The app will try to resolve a conflict where data was changed in both business apps. You can choose the data to use.|
|**Restore Records** and **Delete Records**|These are useful when a record was deleted in one of the business apps. Delete Records deletes the record or row in the app where it still exists. Restore Records recreates the record or row in the business app where it was deleted.|

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce the number of conflicts you need to resolve, you can set up your integration table mappings to apply these actions automatically. For more information, [Mapping Integration Tables](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#mapping-integration-tables).

## To view the synchronization log for a specific (manually synchronized) record
1. Open, for example, a customer, item or any other record that is synchronizing data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Choose the **Synchronization Log** action to view the synchronization log for a selected record. For example, a specific customer you synchronized manually.

## Remove Couplings Between Records
When something goes wrong in your integration and you need to uncouple records to stop synchronizing them, you can do so for one or more records at a time. You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

If an entity with a unidirectional coupling is deleted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must manually delete the broken coupling. To do that, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, choose the **Find for Deleted** action, and then delete the couplings.

# Post service orders and credit memos

After you create a service order, when you're ready you can post it. The order must contain at least one service item line and one service line. If the order has more than one service line, all lines post at the same time.  

If you have a large number of service orders, you can save time by using a batch job to post them. You can run the batch job from any service order.

> [!Tip]
> Before you post a service document, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to to check for errors or missing information. If there are errors, you must correct the problem. You can print a new test report to verify the fix, and then post the document.

## To post a service order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order.  
3. On the **Service Order** page, choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Result**|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**Test Report** | Checks all parts of the document and presents the result in a report. If the report indicates any errors or a lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.|  
    |**Post** | Posts the order without printing a shipment or an invoice.|  
    |**Post and Print** | Posts the order and prints a shipment (if you ship the order without invoicing it) or an invoice (if you invoice the order).|  
    |**Post Batch** | Posts multiple service orders at one time once.|  

4. For the **Post** action, there are several options that control what happens.  

    |**Posting Option**|**Result**|  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    |**Ship** | Posts shipment of the items.|  
    |**Invoice** | Invoices items that have already been shipped.|  
    |**Ship and Invoice** | Invoices and ships the items.|  
    |**Ship and Consume** | Posts shipment and consumption on the order. It updates the relevant quantities on the service lines of the order and on the previously posted service shipment document.|  

You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that shipped but isn't invoiced or consumed.  

When you post the order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents and updates the service order.  

## To batch post service orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Post Batch** action.  
3. You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
4. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

## To post a service credit memo  

After you create a service credit memo, you can post it when you're ready. If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting, an error message displays and stops the process.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the necessary fields.  
4. Choose the **Post** action. If you want to print the credit memo at the same time as your post, choose the **Post and Print** action instead.  
5. To test credit memos before you post them, choose **Test Report**. When you run the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the posting dates in the document.  
6. To post several service credit memos at the same time, run the **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos** batch job. Using the batch job is helpful when you have to post a lot of credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to enter all the necessary information on the credit memos before you batch post them. Otherwise, it is possible that they will not be posted. When the batch job finishes, a message shows how many of the service credit memos it posted.  

## To post consumption from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to post the items, resource hours, and costs used for a specific service operation for which you won't charge your customer. You can post consumed items, hours, or costs only for a posted shipment that has no posted invoices or consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to post consumption for.  
3. Choose the service item. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and specify the quantities for which you'll post consumption in the **Qty. to Consume** field. The quantity can't be larger than the quantity already shipped and the quantity remaining but not invoiced after partial invoicing of this shipment.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To register consumption for a project, fill in the **Project No.**, **Project Task No.**, and the **Project Line Type** fields on the service line.  

5. Choose the lines to post, and then choose the **Post** action. On the page that opens, select **Ship and Consume**.  

The service is posted as either partially or fully consumed, depending on the value in the **Qty. to Consume** field, and the relevant ledger entries are created. Also, previously posted service shipment documents are updated chronologically with the consumed quantities. The relevant quantities are updated on the service lines of the order.  

## To post shipments from service orders  

After you specify the details of a service, you can adjust and post the quantities of items used, time spent, and costs incurred. As a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes the necessary changes to reflect the new state of your inventory and current status of the specific order processing.  

The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that aren't set up to require warehouse handling.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the **Service Lines** page, find the required entries and then specify the quantity to post in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The quantity to ship value depends on whether you want to fully or partially post the shipment. If you choose to ship fully, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field must be equal to the value in the **Quantity** field. When you post a partial shipment, you must specify the quantity you want to ship initially. If you already shipped part of the service on the order, make a note of the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field. The maximum quantity you can enter in the **Quantity to Ship** field is the number of units that haven't shipped.  

4. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Ship**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates ledger entries (in the warranty ledger, item ledger, service ledger, or G/L), produces the posted service shipment document, and updates the relevant fields on the service lines of the service order.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, shipping and moving service line items works in the same way as they do for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, and therefore require two different release functions. To learn more about shipping service line items in advanced warehouse configurations, go to [Picking Items for Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).  

## Combine shipments from multiple service orders into a single service invoice

If needed, you can gather posted shipments that you haven't invoiced in a single invoice. For example, combining shipments can reduce the overall number of invoices to process, which can lower administrative costs and save time for your bookkeeping team. To learn more, go to [Combine shipments on a single invoice](sales-how-to-combine-shipments-on-a-single-invoice.md).

## To undo posted consumption  

You can cancel the consumption on the service orders. For example, because it was posted by mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted.  
3. Choose the **Service Shipment Lines** action.  
4. Choose the lines that contain the incorrect consumption, and then choose the **Undo Consumption** action.  

 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can't undo service consumption if:  

> * The service order has been closed.  
> * It was posted to a project, so there are project ledger entries linked to it.  

## To post service lines  

If you have to work on a service order for a considerable time without posting it, you might want to post some of the service lines linked to it as a way, for example, of keeping your inventory updated. You can post by specifying the relevant quantities on the lines to be posted. You might choose to post the lines one by one or by selecting several lines at a time.  

The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up. If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document, depending on the location setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the lines you're going to post, fill in the **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume** fields, depending on how you post the lines.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.

# Run Full Planning, MPS, or MRP

The terms "running the planning worksheet" or "running MRP" refer to calculating the master production schedule and material requirements. The calculation is based on actual and forecasted demand. The planning system can calculate either Master Production Schedule (MPS) or Material Requirements Planning (MRP) on request, or both at the same time.  

- MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called MPS items and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
- MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that are not MPS items. The purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the appropriate item, at the appropriate time, in the appropriate location, and in the appropriate quantity.  

The planning algorithms for MPS and MRP are the same. The algorithms pertain to netting, reusing existing replenishment orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is, or will be, needed (demand) and what's on-hand or expected (supply). When you net these quantities against each other, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides action messages. Action messages are suggestions to create a new order, change an order (quantity or date), or cancel an order. The term "order" includes purchase orders, assembly orders, production orders, and transfer orders.

You can track the links that the planning creates between demand and supply on the **Order Tracking** page. For more information, see [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards, assembly BOMs, production BOMs, and routings.  

## Methods for generating a plan  

- **Calculate Regenerative Plan:** Process or regenerate the material plan. This process starts by deleting all planned supply orders that are currently loaded. All items in the database are replanned.  
- **Calculate Net Change Plan**: Process a net change plan. Items are considered in net change planning from two types of changes:  
   - **Demand/supply changes:** These changes include modifications to quantities on sales orders, demand forecasts, assembly orders, production orders, or purchase orders. An unplanned inventory level change is also considered a quantity change.  
   - **Planning parameter changes:** These changes include changes in safety stock, reorder point, routing, bill of material, and changes to the time bucket or lead time calculation.  
- **Get Action Messages:** Serves as a short-term planning tool by issuing action messages to alert the user of modifications made since the last time you calculated a regenerative or net change plan.  

With each planned method, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates worksheet entries assuming infinite capacity. Work center and machine center capacity isn't considered when you develop schedules.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Calculate Regenerative Plan is the most common process. The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages, however, can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process.  
>
> You can run the Get Action Messages Plan between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes. However, it isn't meant to replace the full regenerative or net change planning processes.  

## To calculate the planning worksheet
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action to open the **Calculate Plan** page.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**MPS**|Calculate a master production schedule. Items with open sales orders or demand forecasts are considered in this run. <br/>If other demands, for example safety stock, reorder point, or open production component lines, also exist for such items these demands are included in the MPS calculation to ensure that the planning system deals with the complete inventory profile.  |  
    |**MRP**|Calculate material requirements planning. Items with dependent requirements are considered in this run. Typically, MPS and MRP are run at the same time. To run MPS and MRP at the same time, on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Combined MPS/MRP Calculation** field.|  
    |**Starting Date**|Evaluate inventory availability. If an item's on-hand quantity is below the reorder point, the system forward-schedules a replenishment order from this date. If an item is below its safety stock (as of the starting date), the system back-schedules a replenishment order due on the planning starting date.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The ending date of the planning horizon. Neither demand nor supply are considered after this date. If the reorder cycle for an item extends beyond the ending date, the effective planning horizon for that item is equal to the order date plus the reorder cycle.<br/><br/> The planning horizon is the time that the plan is extended to. If the horizon is too short, items with a longer lead time aren't ordered on time. If the horizon is too long, too much time is spent reviewing and processing information that likely changes before it's needed. You can set one planning horizon for production and a longer one for purchases, although it isn't required. A planning horizon for purchases and production should be set to cover the total lead time for components.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the planning run to stop as soon as it encounters an error. A message displays with information about the error. If an error exists, only the successful planning lines made before the error was encountered are presented in the planning worksheet. If you don't select this field, the **Calculate Plan** batch job continues until it completes. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If one or more errors exist, a message displays after completion with information about how many items are affected. The **Planning Error Log** page will then open to provide more details about the error and links to the affected item cards.|  
    |**Use Forecast**|Select a forecast to include as demand when you run the planning batch job. The default forecast is set up on the **Planning** FastTab on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.|  
    |**Exclude Forecast Before**|Define how much of the selected forecast to include in the planning run by entering a date before which forecast demand is not included.|  
    |**Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings**|By default, this field is selected.<br/><br/> Supply on planning lines with warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can define certain planning parameters for planning lines to be respected with certain warnings.<br/><br/>|  

4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to run the planning based on the item, item description, or location.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The batch job runs and planning lines are added to the planning worksheet.  

## To perform action messages
  
1. On the **Planning Worksheet** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
2. On the **Options** FastTab, specify how to create the supplies. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Production Order**|Specify how to create production orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals. You can create either planned or firm planned production orders.|  
    |**Assembly Order**|Specify how to create assembly orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.|  
    |**Purchase Order**|Specify how to create purchase orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for purchase orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Transfer Order**|Specify how to create transfer orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for transfer orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Combine Transfer Orders**|Select whether to combine transfer orders.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the **Carry Out Action Msg. - Plan.** batch job to stop as soon as it finds an error. Aa message displays information about the error. If an error exists, only the planning lines processed before the error was found will create supply orders.|  

3. On the **Planning Line** FastTab, you can set filters to limit the perform action messages.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message. The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted. You can also delete the lines manually.  

## Action messages
  
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network. The messages can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish balance between supply and demand.  

The generation of action messages occurs one level at a time, for each item's low-level code. This makes sure that all items that experience or will experience changes in supply or demand are considered.  

To avoid small, unneeded, or unimportant action messages, you can set dampeners, which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days.  

After you review the action messages and determine whether to accept some or all of the suggested changes, select the **Accept Action Message** field. Next, update the schedules accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
> An action message is a suggestion to create a new order, cancel an order, or change the quantity or date of an order. An order is a purchase order, transfer order, or production order.  

In response to any supply/demand imbalances, the following action messages are generated.  

|Action Message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**New**|If a demand can't be fulfilled by suggesting action messages to **Change Qty.**, **Reschedule**, or **Reschedule & Change Qty.** on existing orders, the action message **New** is generated to suggest a new order. The message **New** is also generated if there aren't supply orders in the reorder cycle of the item. This option determines the number of periods forward and backward in the availability profile when it searches for an order to reschedule.|  
|**Change Quantity**|When the quantity changes for a demand that's tracked to a supply order, the action message **Change Qty.** is generated. The message indicates that the related supply should be changed relative to the change in demand. If a new demand emerges, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for the nearest existing unreserved supply order in the reorder cycle, and issues a change of action message for that order.|  
|**Reschedule**|When a date change for a supply or demand order causes an imbalance in the order network, the action message **Reschedule** is generated. If there is a one-to-one relationship between demand and supply, an action message is generated to suggest that you move the supply order. If the supply-order covers demand from more than one sales order, the supply order is re-scheduled equal to the date of the first demand.|  
|**Resch. & Chg. Qty.**|If both the dates and quantities of an order change, you must change plans with regard to both. Action messaging gathers both actions in one message, **Resched. and Chg. Qty.**, to ensure that the order network returns to balance.|  
|**Cancel**|If a demand that has been covered on an order-to-order basis is deleted, an action message is generated to cancel the related supply order. If the relationship isn't order-to-order, an action message is generated to change in order to reduce the supply. If through other factors, such as inventory adjustments, a supply order isn't required at the time you generate the action messages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests an action message of **Cancel** in the worksheet.|

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.  

Your administrator can learn more about trials and subscriptions [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions).  

## Copy a company

On the **Companies** page, you can use the **Copy** action to create a second company based on the contents of an existing company. Copying a company is useful, for example, when you want to test a company without disrupting production data.

> [!Important]
> Don't use the Copy action to take a backup of a company. To take a backup, start by exporting the database as a .bacpac file. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export) in the development and administration help.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dataverse-copy-company](includes/dataverse-copy-company.md)]

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you won't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

For more information, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). For more information about environments, see [Understanding the Infrastructure of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology) (in English only).  

## Changing a company's name

After you create a company, you can't change its name. You can, however, change its **Display Name**, which is text that shows for the company throughout the application.  

> [!TIP]
> You can rename a company if you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Add Contoso Coffee

The Contoso Coffee app provides demonstration data to help you explore the advanced capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Find the app in AppSource, and install it in an empty company, for example a company in a sandbox environment. For more information, see [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

# Assemble Items

If the **Replenishment System** field on the item card contains **Assembly**, the default method of supplying the item is to assemble it according to an assembly BOM, and potentially by a specific resource. Learn more at [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). Learn more about how to set up an assembly item at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

You can set up assembly items for two assembly processes.

|Process  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assemble to stock     | Items that you assemble and stock for future sales. For example, kits for an upcoming sales campaign. The items aren't related to a sales order, at least not yet. Typically, these items aren't customized for customer requests.        |
|Assemble to order     | Items that you don't want to stock. For example, because they're customized based on customer orders or to reduce the cost of on-hand inventory. |
  
This article describes the standard settings for assemble to stock. There might be other ways that are more suited for your business though. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md) and [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Assembly components are handled in a special way in basic warehouse configurations. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

## To assemble an item to stock

Follow the steps in this procedure to assemble an item to stock. To learn about assemble to order, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **New Assembly Order** page opens.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Item No.** field, select the item that you want to assemble. You can select items that are set up for assembly and have an assembly BOM, or items without an assembly BOM. The latter is useful for unplanned assemblies or scenarios when you want to use item reclassification and track costs.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the item that you want assembled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components are not available to fulfill quantity on the due date, the **Assembly Availability** page opens. The page shows how many assembly items can be assembled based on component availability. Learn more at [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md). When you close the page, the assembly order is created with availability alerts on the lines for the affected components.  

    The lines contain the contents of the assembly BOM and the specified quantities.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Assembly Availability** page opened when you filled in the assembly order header, each affected assembly order line contains a **Yes** in the **Avail. Warning** field with a link to detailed availability information. <!--check whether this field help is useful For more information, see Check Availability.--> You can resolve a component availability issue by:

    > * Postponing the starting date.
    > * Replacing the component with another item.
    > * Selecting an available substitution if one is defined.  

6. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, enter how many units of the assembly item that you want to post as output the next time you post the assembly order. This quantity can be lower than the value in the **Quantity** field to reflect a partial output posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To make sure that component consumption posting matches the assembly item output posting, the quantity fields in the assembly order lines automatically adjust to the value that you enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field.  
7. On assembly order lines of type **Item** or **Resource**, in the **Quantity to Consume** field, specify how many units you want to post as consumed the next time that you post the assembly order.
8. When you are ready to partially or fully post, choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If warnings are still present in the assembly order lines, you can't post the order. A message displays the component or components that are not in inventory.  

After posting succeeds, the assembly item is posted as output to the location code and potential bin code that are defined on the assembly order. For manually created assembly orders, the location may be copied from the **Default Location for Orders** setup field. For assemble-to-order flows, the location code may be copied from the sales order line.

# Make payments with the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension or SEPA credit transfer

On the **Payment Journals** page, you can process payments to your vendors by exporting a file together with the payment information from the journal lines. You can then upload the file to your electronic bank where the related money transfers are processed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

 To enable SEPA credit transfers, you must first set up a bank account, a vendor, and the general journal batch that the payment journal is based on. You then prepare payments to vendors by automatically filling the **Payment Journals** page with due payments with specified posting dates.  

After you verify that the bank processed the payments, you can post the payment journal lines.  

## Setting up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension

Activate the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to:

* Convert bank statement files to a format that you can import.
* Convert your exported payment files to the format that your bank requires.

For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

## Setting up SEPA credit transfer

From the **Payment Journals** page, you can export payments to a file for upload to your electronic bank for processing of the related money transfers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.  

To be able export of a bank file format that isn't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process payment electronically by exporting payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the bank account in question to handle the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up vendor cards to process payments by exporting files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up the related general journal batch to enable payment export from the **Payment Journals** page  
* Connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods  

> [!NOTE]
> Business Central supports both SEPA format CT pain.001.001.03 and CT pain.001.001.09. You can choose any format on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

> [!TIP]
> This article applies to the generic version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In your country or region, additional required fields may have been added to the various pages. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up a bank account for SEPA Credit Transfer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the bank account from which you export payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format.
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.** field, choose a number series from which numbers are assigned to SEPA credit transfer entries.
4. On the **Communication** FastTab, enter address and contact information for the bank. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must fill in the **Country/Region Code** field. If the field is blank, you can't export payments for the account. Also, the country/region must have a valid ISO Code.

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Currency Code** field, specify the currency for the bank account.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The **Currency Code** field must be set to **EUR**, because SEPA credit transfers can only be made in the EURO currency.  

6. On the **Transfer** FastTab, in the **Payment Export Format** field, choose the SEPA format you want to use.  
7. In the **IBAN** field, specify the international bank account number for the account.  

### To set up a vendor card for SEPA Credit Transfer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card of the vendor you pay electronically using export payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format.  
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Payment Method Code** field, choose **BANK**.  
4. In the **Preferred Bank Account** field, choose the bank to which the money transfers when it's processed by your electronic bank.  

    If you don't have a bank account set up for this vendor, you can do so now. For more information, see [To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md#to-set-up-vendor-bank-accounts-for-export-of-bank-files). The value in the **Preferred Bank Account** field is copied to the **Recipient Bank Account** field on the **Payment Journal** page.  

### To set the payment journal up to export payment files

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose the drop\-down button.  
3. On the **General Journal Batches** page, choose the **Edit List** action.  
4. On the line for the payment journal that you use to export payments, select the **Allow Payment Export** checkbox.  

### To connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Methods** page, select the payment method that is used to export payments from, and then choose the **Pmt. Export Line Definition** field.  
3. On the **Pmt. Export Line Definitions** page, select the code that you specified in the **Code** field on the **Line Definitions** FastTab in step 4 in the "To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file" section in the [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md) procedure.  

## Preparing the payment journal

Fill the payment journal with lines for due payments to vendors, with the option to insert posting dates based on the due date of the related purchase documents. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## Exporting payments to a bank file

When you're ready to make payments to your vendors, or reimbursements to your employees, you can export a file with the payment information on the lines on the **Payment Journals** page. You can then upload the file to your bank to process the related money transfers.

In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension is available. In North American versions, the same extension can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can export payment files from the payment journal, you must specify the electronic format for the involved bank account, and you must enable the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md) and [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md). In addition, you must select the **Allow Payment Export** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

Use the **Credit Transfer Registers** page to view the payment files that exported from the payment journal. From this page, you can also re-export payment files if there were technical errors or file changes. Note, however, that exported EFT files aren't shown in this page and can't be re-exported.  

### To export payments to a bank file

The following steps describe how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. For more information, see [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using EFT, you must select either **Electronic Payment** or **Electronic Payment–IAT** in the **Bank Payment Type** field. Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** and **Vendor Bank Account Card** pages. You will be informed about wrong or missing setup values as you try to export the file.
    >
    > The EFT feature can only be used for bank accounts in the local currency. It cannot be used with a foreign currency, indicated by a value in the **Currency Code** field. (Blank field value means local currency.)

3. After you fill in all payment journal lines, choose the **Export** action.
4. On the **Export Electronic Payments** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    Error messages show in the **Payment File Errors** FactBox, where you can also choose an error message to access more details. You must resolve all errors before you can export the payment file.

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, a common error message states that the bank account number does not have the length that your bank requires. To avoid or resolve the error, you must remove the value in the **IBAN** field on the **Bank Account Card** page and then, in the **Bank Account No.** field, enter a bank account number in the format that your bank requires.

5. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you are using EFT, save the resulting vendor remittance form as a Word document or select to have it emailed directly to the vendor. The payments are now added to the **Generate EFT File** page from where you can generate multiple payment orders together to save transmission cost. For more information, see the following steps.
6. On the **Payment Journals** page, choose the **Generate EFT File** action.

    On the **Generate EFT File** page, the **Lines** FastTab shows all EFT payments that you exported from the payment journal for a bank account but aren't yet generated.
7. Choose the **Generate EFT File** action to export one file for all the EFT payments.
8. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

The bank payment file is exported to the location you specified. You can upload it to your electronic bank account and make the actual payments. Then you can post the exported payment journal lines.

### To plan when to post exported payments

If you don't want to post a payment journal line for an exported payment, you can just delete the journal line. For example, because you're waiting for confirmation that the bank processed the transaction. Later, when you create a payment journal line to pay the remaining amount, the **Total Exported Amount** field shows how much of the payment amount was already exported. Also, you can find detailed information about the exported total by choosing the **Credit Transfer Reg. Entries** button to see details about exported payment files.

If you don't want to post payments until the bank confirms they're processed, you can:

* In a payment journal with suggested payment lines, you can sort on either the **Exported to Payment File** column or the **Total Exported Amount** and then delete payment suggestions for open invoices for which payments were already made.
* On the **Suggest Vendor Payments** page, where you specify which payments to insert in the payment journal, you can select the **Skip Exported Payments** checkbox if you don't want to insert journal lines for payments that were already exported.

To see information about exported payments, choose the **Payment Export History** action.

### To re-export payments to a bank file

You can re-export payment files from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Before you delete or post payment journal lines, you can also re-export the payment file from the **Payment Journals** page by exporting it again. If you delete or post the payment journal lines after your export, you can re-export the same payment file from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Select the line for the batch of credit transfers that you want to re-export, and then use the **Reexport Payments to File** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> Exported EFT files are not shown on the **Credit Transfer Registers** page and cannot be re-exported.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Credit Transfer Registers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a payment export that you want to re-export, and then choose the **Reexport Payment to File** action.

## Posting the payments

After your bank processes the electronic payment, post the payments. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

# Create recurring purchase lines

If you often need to create purchase lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.

## Set up recurring purchase lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter the information in the fields that reflect the standard lines you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring purchase lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual purchase documents after you insert the recurring purchase lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring purchase lines to a vendor

Assign one or more recurring purchase lines to a vendor so that they're available to insert on purchase documents from that vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant vendor.
3. Choose the **Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, select codes for the recurring purchase lines that you want to be able to insert on purchase documents for the vendor.
5. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring purchase lines are to be used.
6. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on each document type, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring purchase line that exists for the vendor.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring purchase line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Purchase Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a vendor card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring purchase lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring purchase lines on a purchase invoice

If recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you can insert them, or have them automatically added, on all types of purchase documents, such as a purchase invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring purchase lines to vendors, you'll be informed if recurring purchase lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to insert one or more standard purchase lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard purchase lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard purchase lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a840d10b-557c-4c8d-8186-87f962d876e8]

## To correct a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

## To cancel a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# Review and apply payments manually after automatic application
For each journal line representing a payment on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. For more information about automatic application, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When the bank account that you are reconciling payments for is set up for the local currency, then the **Payment Application** page will show all open entries in the local currency, including open entries for documents that were originally invoiced in foreign currencies. Payments applied to entries with converted currencies may therefore be posted with different amounts than on the original document because of the potentially different exchange rates used by the bank and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respectively.

Therefore, we recommend that you look for foreign currency codes in the **Currency Code** field on the **Payment Application** page to check if applications are based on converted currencies. To review the original document amount in the foreign currency and to see the exchange rate used, choose the **Applies-to Entry No.** field, and then, on the shortcut menu, choose the drilldown button to open the **Customer Ledger Entries** or **Vendor Ledger Entries** page.

Any gains-and-loss adjustment required due to currency conversions isn't handled automatically by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
>   You cannot apply entries with a different sign than the sign on the payment. For example, to close both a negative-sign credit memo and its related positive-sign invoice, you must first apply the credit memo to the invoice, and then apply the payment to the invoice with the reduced remaining amount.

> [!WARNING]  
>   If you use payment discounts, and if the payment date is before the payment due date, then the **Remaining Amt. Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Application** page will be used for matching. Otherwise, the value in the **Remaining Amount** field will be used. If the payment was made with a discounted amount after the payment due date, or the full amount was paid but a discount was granted, then the amount will not be matched.

> [!NOTE]  
>   You can only apply a payment to one account. If you want to split the application on multiple open entries, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, then the open entries must be for the same account. For more information, see steps 7 and 8 in the procedure in this topic.

## To review or apply payments after automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the payment reconciliation journal for a bank account that you want to reconcile payments for. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, select a payment that you want to review or manually apply to one or more open entries, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action.
4. Select the **Applied** check box on the line for the open entry that you want to apply the payment to.
5. The payment amount, which is also shown in the **Transaction Amount** field on the **Payment Application** page, is inserted in the **Applied Amount** field, but you can modify the field, for example if you want to apply the amount to several open entries.
6. To apply a part of the paid amount to another open entry for the account, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, select the **Applied** check box for the line. The applied amount is automatically deducted from the transactions amount to reflect the distribution on the two open entries.
7. To apply a part of a payment to one or more open entries that doesn't exist in the database, create a new line under the line for the same account. In the **Applied Amount** field, enter the amount to apply on the new line, and then adjust the **Applied Amount** field on the existing line.
8. Repeat steps 5, 6, or 7 for other open entries that you want to apply a full or partial payment amount to.
9. When you have reviewed a payment application or manually applied to one or more open entries, choose the **Accept Application** action.

The **Payment Application** page  closes, and on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, the value in the **Match Confidence** field is changed to **Accepted** to indicate to you that you have reviewed or manually applied the payment.

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Specify when and how to receive workflow notifications

In workflows that require that someone approves changes, you must set up the approval users who approve or reject changes. For example, you might want someone to approve new records. An important part of the approval user setup is to specify how and when the user is notified of the change. For example, you can specify that an approval user immediately receives an email when someone creates a new customer. You can also schedule notifications to be delivered, for example, on a weekly or monthly basis.

People can also change their notification setup by choosing **Change Notification Settings** on any notification.  

> [!NOTE]
> Notifications are delivered according to the notification settings for the receiver, not the sender. That's an important distinction because it means that when someone requests an approval as part of a workflow, their request is not necessarily sent immediately. Instead, it's delivered according to the notification schedule specified in the approver's notification settings.

Before you can set up an approval user's notification preferences, you must set up the user as an approval user. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> To use email as the notification method, you must set email up for both the sender and the receiver in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

## Steps in workflows

Many approval workflow steps are about notifying users of an event they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a process with the approved record. For workflow steps involving approvals, each notification is tied to an approval entry. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## Specify when and how approval users receive notifications  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line for the user you want to set up notification preferences for, then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
3. On the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you open the **Workflow Notification Setup** page from the **Approval User Setup** page the notification setup is linked to the approval user. The approval user will always receive workflow notifications according to that notification setup. If you use the *Tell Me* feature to open the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, the notification setup applies to all users.

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**Notification Type**|Specify the type of event the notification is about.<br /><br /> Select one of the following options:<br /><br /> -   **New Record** specifies that the notification is about a new record, such as a document, that the user must act on.<br />-   **Approval** specifies that the notification is about one or more approval requests.<br />-   **Overdue** specifies that the notification is to remind users that they're late in acting on an event.|
   |**Notification Method**|Specify if the notification is an email or an internal note.|

   You can define the layout of email notifications by customizing Report 1320, Notification Email. Learn more at [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

   You specified how the user receives notifications. Now specify when the user receives notifications.  
4. Choose the **Notification Schedule** action.  
5. On the **Notification Schedule** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**Recurrence**|Specify the recurring pattern in which notifications are sent to the user.|
   |**Time**|Specify what time of day notifications are sent to the user when the value in the **Recurrence** field is anything other than **Instantly**.|
   |**Daily Frequency**|Specify on which type of days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Daily**.<br /><br /> Select **Weekday** to receive notifications every day of the work week. Select **Daily** to receive notifications every day of the week, including weekends.|
   |**Monday** through **Sunday**|Specify on which days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Weekly**.|
   |**Date of Month**|Specify if the user receives notifications on the first, last, or a specific date of the month.|
   |**Monthly Notification Date**|Specify the date of the month on which the user receives notifications when the value in the **Date of Month** field is **Custom**.|

## Change when and how you receive notifications

1. On one of the notifications you received, either as an email or a note, choose **Change Notification Settings**.  
2. On the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, change your notification preferences as described in steps 3-5 above.
   1. Confirm that the correct notification is chosen under the **Notification Type** field.
   2. Choose whether to receive an email or note notification under the  **Notification Method** field.
   3. Select the **Notification Schedule** to change the frequency and recurrence in which notifications are sent.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Walkthrough: Make cash flow forecasts using financial reports

This walkthrough describes how you can use the financial reports feature to make cash flow forecasts. Financial reports perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the financial reports, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used to make cash flow forecasts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the following tasks:  

- Setting up a new cash flow financial report name.  
- Setting up financial report lines.  
- Setting up a new column definition.  
- Assigning a column definition to a financial report.  
- Viewing and printing the cash flow forecast.  

### Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A cash flow worksheet with registered lines  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user role:  

- Controller  

## Story

Ken is a controller at CRONUS who makes monthly cash flow forecasts. Ken includes finance, sales, purchase, and fixed assets in the forecasts, and presents to CFO Sara for business insight.  

## Set up a new financial report name

The financial report name is the name you give the cash flow forecast that includes a series of defined lines and a column definition.  

### Set up a new financial report name  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose **New** to create a new cash flow financial report name.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter **Forecast**.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter **Cash Flow Forecast**.  
5. Leave the **Row Definition** and **Column Definition** fields blank.

## Set up row definition lines

After a financial report name is set up, Ken defines each line in the cash flow financial report. Ken defines lines to be shown in reports in addition to lines that are only for calculation purposes.  

### Set up row definition lines  

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report you created, then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.  
2. On the **Row Definition** page, enter each line as shown in the following table.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Use the **Insert CF Accounts** function to quickly mark, in the cash flow accounts chart, the cash flow accounts you want and copy them to row definition lines.  

    | Row No. | Description              | Totaling Type            | Totaling | Row Type   | Amount Type | Show |
    |---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|------|

    > [!NOTE]
    > The row number R10 is used to capture the account totals for receivables. The row number R20 is used to calculate the sum of all cash receipts. The row number R30 is used to capture the account totals for payables. The row number R40 is used to calculate the sum of all cash disbursements. The row number R50 is used to capture the sum of cash surplus. The row number R60 is used to capture the liquid funds. The row number R70 is used to calculate the forecasted cash flow.

## Set up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|

## Assig the column definition to the financial report name

Ken is now ready to assign the column definition to the financial report name.  

### Assign the column definition to the financial report name

1. In the **Financial Reports** page, select the **Forecast** financial report, then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.  
2. In the **Name** field, choose the column definition **Cash Flow** to assign as the default column definition.  

## View and print the cash flow forecast

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **Forecast** financial report [Financial analytics overview](bi.md)  to view the cash flow forecast.  
2. On the **Financial Report** page, you can select an amount and then view the cash flow forecast entries that make up the amount. In addition, you can view the formula used to calculate that amount. You can also filter the amounts by date and dimension.  
3. Choose the **Print** action to print the cash flow forecast.

# About cost accounting

Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business. Cost accounting information is designed to analyze:  

- What types of costs your business incurs.  
- Where the costs occur.
- Who bears the costs.

In cost accounting, you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations, departments, products, and projects to analyze the profitability of your company.  

## Workflow in cost accounting

Cost accounting has the following main components:  

- Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects  
- Cost entries and cost journals  
- Cost allocations  
- Cost budgets
- Cost reporting  

The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting.  

![Cost Accounting overview.](media/costaccountingoverview.png "CostAccountingOverview")  

## Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects

You define cost types, cost centers, and cost objects to analyze what the costs are, where the costs come from, and who should bear the costs.  

First, you define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts. You can create your own chart of cost types or do so by transferring the general ledger income statement accounts.  

Cost centers are departments and profit centers responsible for costs and income. Often, there are more cost centers set up in cost accounting than in any dimension that is set up in the general ledger. In the general ledger, typically only the first level cost centers for direct costs and the initial costs are used. In cost accounting, more cost centers are created for extra allocation levels.  

Cost objects are products, product groups, or services a company offers. These objects are the "finished goods" that carry the costs.  

You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company. Through the general ledger, you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions and supplement that information with subtotals and titles.  

## Cost entries and cost journals

Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger. You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting. You can also use a batch job to transfer general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting.  

In cost journals, you can post cost and activities that don't come from the general ledger or aren't generated by allocations. For example, you can post pure operational costs, internal charges, allocations, and corrective entries between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects individually, or on a recurring basis.  

## Cost allocations

Allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. Overhead costs are first posted to cost centers and later charged to cost objects. An example would be a sales department that sells several products at the same time. The department's overhead costs, such as salaries, supplies, and travel expenses, are initially assigned to the sales cost center. The costs are then allocated between the different products (cost objects) sold, together with the materials purchased (direct cost).

The allocation base and the accuracy of the allocation definition influence the results of cost allocations. The allocation definition allocates costs first from so-called precost centers to main cost centers, and then from cost centers to cost objects.  

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. You can allocate actual values or budgeted values using the static allocation method based on a definite value. For example, square footage, or an established allocation ratio of 5:2:4. You can also allocate actual values or budgeted values by using the dynamic allocation method with nine predefined allocation bases and 12 dynamic date ranges.  

## Cost budgets

Similar to budgeting in the general ledger, you can create budgets to plan for costs during a certain period (a fiscal year, for example), which can be applied to a cost center (company department), or a cost object (product or service). You can create as many cost budgets as you need. You can then copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa. And you can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs.

## Cost reporting

Most reports and statistics are based on the posted cost entries. You can set the sorting of the results and use filters to define which data must be displayed. You can create reports for cost distribution analysis. In addition, you can use the standard financial reports to define how your reports for the chart of cost types are displayed.

# Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods.

To analyze budgeted amounts, you must first create general ledger (G/L) budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## View a G/L budget

In a budget with dimensions, you can filter the entries and see specific budgets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **G/L Budgets** page, open the budget you want to view.  
3. At the top of the page, fill in the fields necessary to define what is shown. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then you must fill in the **View by** field. If you have not selected **Period** in either of those fields, enter the appropriate period in the **Date Filter** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only entries from the general ledger budget with the filter codes you enter on the **Filters** FastTab are included in the calculation. Budget entries without any or with other filter codes are not included. As long as the filter remains on the page, the budget only displays entries with those filter codes.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Edit Budget** action to modify the budget. On the budget page, choose an amount to view the underlying general ledger budget entries.

## View actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts

You can view general ledger budgets and compare them with actual figures in several areas of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. Hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

> [!NOTE]  
> The filters you set on the page header will be applied to both general ledger and budget entries.

The leftmost columns contain the chart of accounts. Of the five columns on the rightmost side, the first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **View by** field on the **G/L Balance/Budget** page to select the period length. Use the **View as** field to select the way the amounts will be calculated, either **Net Change** or **Balance at Date**. Choose the **Previous Period** or **Next Period** action to change the period.  

## To view actual and budgeted amounts for several periods  

Instead of viewing the actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts within a single period, you can view a number of periods for a single account.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant general ledger account, then choose the **G/L Account Balance/Budget** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

# Reconcile payments using automatic application

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page specifies payments, either incoming or outgoing, that have been recorded as transactions on your online bank account or on a payment service. You can apply the payments to related open customer, vendor, and bank account ledger entries. Fill in the journal by importing a bank statement as a bank feed or file or by manually entering transactions that you make through your payment service.

> [!NOTE]
> The page offers automatic matching functionality that applies payments to their related open entries based on a matching of data on a bank statement line (journal line) with data on one or more open entries. Note that you can overwrite the suggested automatic applications, and you can choose to not use automatic application at all. For more information, see step 7.

A payment reconciliation journal is related to one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The bank account represents the online bank account where the payment transactions are recorded. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. The bank account will be automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

If you use the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page to register and apply customer payments, you can set up the journal to use a specific number series. Afterward, you can specify the number series in the **Payment Reconciliation No. Series** field on a bank account. Using a dedicated number series can make it easier to identify any entries that were posted through the journal.

Similar to other journals, when you correct posted entries you can reverse entries that were posted through the payment reconciliation journal from the **G/L Register** page. For example, you might want to reverse entries for payments you applied to the wrong customer. You must first un-apply the posted customer ledger entries. Then you can use the **Reverse Register** action in the **G/L Register** page to reverse the journal that posted the payments. Alternatively, on the **Posted General Journals** page, you can use the **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** action to reverse specific lines from the posted payment reconciliaiton journal. 

When you use automatic application, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recognizes bank ledger entries that have already been posted, which helps prevent double-posting.

You can import bank transactions as .csv bank files or other format that your bank provides. If you want to import bank statements as bank feeds, you must first enable a dedicated bank integration service, and then link the bank account to its related online bank account. The payment reconciliation journal will then automatically detect bank feeds when you choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action. In addition, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statement feeds every hour. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled won't be imported. You can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service for to get those transactions, which is preinstalled in some country versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md). Alternatively, a Microsoft partner can help you meet your business or country requirements.

The **Map Text to Account** action lets you set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal. Mapping is useful, for example, for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. (See step 10) For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

Journal lines might have no suggested application, which can happen for various reason. For example, because a document is missing, or a customer overpaid and there's an excess amount after applying the payment on another journal line. For such cases, you can use the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry, for example for a refund, that is needed to apply the payment to. (See step 11) For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

You use the **Apply Automatically** function either automatically when you import a bank file or feed with payment transactions or when you activate it, to apply payments to their related open entries based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (journal line) with text on one or more open entries. This automation is based on rules that you define on the **Payment Application Rules** page, where you also define whether an application suggestion requires review. For more information, see [Set up rules for automatic application of payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

On journal lines where a payment has been applied automatically to one or more open entries, the **Match Confidence** field has a value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** to indicate the quality of the data matching that the suggested payment application is based on.

Some payment applications require your review as defined by the used matching rule, such as lines with **Low** match confidence. Other lines require your review and manual change because there's a value in the **Difference** field. To review one or more payment applications, choose the **Lines to Review** or **Lines with Difference** field at the bottom. The **Payment Application Review** page opens showing all relevant information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** action. (See steps 7 and 8)

For each journal line on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. (See step 10) For more information, see [Review, or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can start the bank transactions import at the same time as you open the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page for an existing journal. The following procedure describes how to import bank transactions into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page after you have created a new journal.

## To reconcile payments using automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To work in a new payment reconciliation journal, choose the **New Journal** action.
3. On the **Payment Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to reconcile payments for, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page opens prepared for the selected bank account.
4. Choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action.
   If the bank account for the selected journal isn't set up for importing bank transactions, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will help you do that.
5. On the **Select a file to import** page, select the file that contains the bank transactions for payments that you want to reconcile, and then choose the **Open** button.  
6. If the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is enabled, on the **Bank Statement Filter** page that opens automatically, specify the date interval for the bank statements to be imported.

    The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page is filled with lines for payments representing bank transactions in the imported bank statement.

     On lines for payments that have been automatically applied to related open entries, the **Match Confidence** field indicates the quality of the data matching on which the suggested payment application is based. Also, the **Account Name**, **Account Type**, and **Account No.** fields show information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to.

    The automatic applications, the matching qualities, and whether lines require review are controlled by rules. You can edit the rules to adjust the results. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

7. To review, accept/remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that have a value in the **Difference** field, choose the **Lines with Difference** action at the bottom.

    The **Payment Application Review** page opens and shows the first application to review. The next application to review will be shown on the page as you process the preceding one. The review includes information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** and **Apply Manually** actions.

8. To review, accept or remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that the rule has set to be reviewed, choose the **Lines to Review** action. 

9. To change an automatic application, select a journal line, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action to reapply or apply the payment manually on the **Payment Application** page. For more information, see [Review or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

10. Select an unapplied journal line for a recurring cash receipt or expense, such as a car gasoline purchase, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

    When you've finished your mapping of payment text to accounts, choose the **Apply Manually** action.

    When text-to-account mapping is set up, the resulting automatic payment application will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping** in the **Match Confidence** field.

11. For a journal line has no suggested application because no ledger entry exists that it can be applied to, choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry that is needed to apply the payment to. For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied.](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)

12. When no more lines require review and the **Difference** field is blank on all lines, choose the **Post** action, and then choose one of the following options:

    - **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Accounts** - To post the payments as applied and also close the related bank account ledger entries as reconciled.
    - **Post Payments Only** - To only post the payments as applied, but leave the related bank account ledger entries open. Required that you reconcile the bank account separately,  for example: For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).
    - **Test Report** - To review the result of posting before you post. The **Bank Account Statement** report opens and shows the same fields as at the bottom of the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

When you post the payment reconciliation journal, the applied open entries are closed. The customer, vendor, or general ledger accounts are updated. For payments on journal lines based on text-to-account mapping, the specified customer, vendor, and general ledger accounts are updated. For all journal lines, bank account ledger entries are created. If you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action, any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

You can compare the value in the **Balance on Bank Account After Posting** field together with the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** field to track when the bank account is reconciled based on payments that you post.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you do not want to reconcile the bank account from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, then you must use the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

# Set up locations

Locations are places such as warehouses where you buy, store, or sell items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses locations to help keep track of inventory in both simple and complex warehouse processes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. To learn more, go to [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fe5ed50e-2e5d-47d4-8616-92ae4639f400]

## Location cards

You specify information about a location, such as a warehouse or distribution center, on the **Location Card** page. You give each location a name and a code that represents the location. You can then enter the location code in other parts of the program when you want to record transactions for a given location.  

You can enter information about bins and warehouse policies for each location. Based on your warehouse policies, you can use the options on the **Bins** FastTab to specify the bins to use by default for transactions. If you're using directed put-away and pick, the options on the **Bin Policies** FastTab let you define how to use advanced warehousing features.  

Some option fields depend on settings in the **Location Card** page to restrict unsupported setup combinations.  

Choose the **Zones** or **Bins** actions to view information about zones and bins that are defined for the location.

### To set up a location

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many fields on the Location Card page are related to the handling of items in inbound and outbound warehouse processes. These fields are not relevant for companies that do not require complex warehouse functionality. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

You can change the configuration of a location as long as it doesn't have item ledger entries.  

If you have multiple locations, you can define transfer routes between locations. To learn more about transfer routes, go to [To create a transfer route](inventory-how-setup-locations.md#to-create-a-transfer-route).

### To create a transfer route

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
4. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. To learn more about transfers, go to [Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

## Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure and can suggest where to put items. Your bins can have contents, or be floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, on the **Location Card** page, on the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle. You can design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in the fields for the warehouse processes on the **Bins** and **Bin Policies** FastTabs.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can specify bin codes on a location, you must create bin codes. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## Zones

If you want to structure your bins under zones, you can do that in the **Zones** page. When you assign a zone to bins, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies information from the zone to the bins. You can also choose to set up one zone and use bins alone to organize your warehouse. To learn more about zones, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Default Dimensions for Locations

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them using various reporting tools. For example, dimensions can indicate the department or project an entry came from. Having default dimensions helps people avoid making mistakes and having to enter dimensions manually on the transaction level if all goods come from a single location and department.

You set default dimensions for a location on the **Location Card** page by choosing **Dimensions**. Afterward, the location's default dimensions are assigned to the following documents when you choose the location on a line.

* Transfer orders
* Physical inventory orders
* Inventory shipments
* Inventory receipts
* Item journals

If needed, you can delete or change the dimension on the line. In the **Value Posting** field, you can require people to specify dimensions for locations before they can post an entry. If you want to allow people to choose only certain dimension values, you can specify the values in the **Allowed Values Filter** field. You can also include location dimension values on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, and for combinations of priority and dimension rules on the **Dimension Combinations** page.

Because transfer order documents and reclassification journals deal with more than one location, the order in which you enter data is important. Default dimensions are copied from the last location field (the in-transit location is ignored).

### Example of default dimensions on locations

The following examples illustrate how the default dimension is used.

You have the following dimension settings:

* Location EAST. Department dimension is ADM
* Location WEST. Department dimension is PROD

You specify the location on a transfer order as follows:

1. From Location = EAST
2. To Location = WEST

The PROD dimension will be copied from location WEST.

You fill in the fields in the opposite order, as follows:

1. To Location = WEST
2. From Location = EAST

The ADM dimension will be copied from location EAST.

# Plan for New Demand Order by Order

This planning task can be performed on the **Order Planning** page, which displays all new demand along with availability information and suggestions for supply. It provides the visibility and tools needed to effectively plan demand from sales lines and component lines and then create different types of supply orders directly.  

You can enter the **Order Planning** page in two ways depending on your focus: From an order that you want to plan for specifically or in batch mode because you want to plan for all and any new demand.  


## To plan for new production order demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. (You can perform these steps for planned, firm planned, or released production orders).
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

The page displays planning lines according to the view filter **Production Demand**, meaning unfulfilled component lines of all existing production orders. Demand for only the one production order is not shown because it is necessary to plan for one production order with an overview of demand for potentially earlier components lines. Planning lines for the production order in context are expanded.  

## To plan for any new demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.
3. Choose the **Expand (+)** button in front of the date in the **Demand Date** field to see the underlying planning lines that represent demand lines with insufficient availability.  
4. For each expanded planning line, that is, demand line, you can see values in information fields at the bottom of the page.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Qty. on Other Locations**|Shows if the item exists on another location. You can then look up and select it.|  
    |**Substitutes Exist**|Shows if a substitute item is created for the item. You can then look up and select it. Note that this feature only applies to components, that is, from demand lines of type **Production**.|  
    |**Quantity Available**|Shows the total availability of the item, that is, the Projected Available Balance.|  
    |**Earliest Date Available**|Shows the arrival date of an inbound supply order that can cover the needed quantity on a date later than the demand date.|  

5. In the **Replenishment System** field, select which type of supply order to create.  

    The default value is that of the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of three options:  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchase**|Creates a purchase order.|  
    |**Transfer**|Creates a transfer order.|  
    |**Prod. Order**|Creates a production order.|  

    In the **Supply From** field you must select a value according to the selected replenishment system.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the field is not filled in, the system will display an error message when you use the **Make Supply Order** function, and no supply order will be created for the planning line in question. This, however, is not the case if the replenishment system is **Prod. Order**.  

6. From the **Supply From** field, you can look up in the relevant list and select where the supply should come from:  

    - If replenishment system is **Purchase**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page.  
    - If replenishment system is **Transfer**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Location List** page.  

    In case the item exists in another location, the **Qty. on Other Location** field at the bottom shows a value and you can then look up and select the location from which the item should be supplied when you make the transfer order.  

    If a substitute exists for the demanded item, the **Substitute Exists** field is set to **Yes**, and you can then look up to the **Item Substitution Entries** page and select the substitute.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

7. Select the **Reserve** check box if you want to make a reservation between the supply order you are creating and the demand line that it is created for. It is empty by default.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only select this check box if the item has **Optional** or **Always** in the **Reserve** field on its item card.  

8. In the **Qty. to Order** field, you can enter the quantity that will go on the supply order you are creating.   
    The default value is the same quantity as that in the **Needed Quantity** field. But you may decide to order more or less than this quantity based on your knowledge of the demand situation. If, for example, you see on the **Order Planning** page that several unrelated demand lines are for the same purchased item, and they are due around the same date, you can consolidate these by entering the total needed quantity in the **Qty. to Order** field of one line, and then delete the other, obsolete planning lines for that item.  

9. In the **Due Date** and **Order Date** fields, you can enter the dates that should apply to the created supply orders.  

    These two fields are interrelated according to the **Default Safety Lead Time** field, which can be found on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. By default, the due date is the same as the demand date, but you can change this as you like.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you enter a date later than the demand date, you will receive a warning message.  

## To make supply orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. You can perform these steps for a planned, firm planned, or released production order.  
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. Place the cursor on a relevant planning line, and then choose the **Make Orders** action.  
4. On the **Make Supply Orders** page, on the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, select one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**The Active Line**|Make a supply order only for the line where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**The Active Order**|Make supply orders for all lines in the order where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**All Lines**|Make supply orders for all lines on the **Order Planning** page.|  

5. On the **Options** FastTab, define what kind of supply orders, or requisition worksheet lines, should be made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The settings you last made on the **Make Supply Orders** page will be saved under your user ID so that they are the same the next time you use the page.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to make the suggested supply orders or requisition worksheet lines.  

You have now planned for the unfulfilled demand by making respective supply orders. Details about specific work flows when using the **Order Planning** page would depend on a company’s internal policies.  

When you have finished your planning work on the **Order Planning** page, for example defined an alternative way to supply the quantity, you can proceed to create supply orders for one or more of the planning lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The supply orders you create may introduce new dependent demand, for example for underlying production orders, and you should therefore choose **Calculate Plan** again to find and resolve this before moving down the list.

# Terminology in cost accounting

This article defines the key terms that are used in cost accounting.  

## Key terms

 The following table shows definitions of the key terms in cost accounting.  

|**Term**|**Definition**|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|Allocation key|The allocation key is the basis that is used to allocate costs. It's typically a quantity, such as square meters occupied, number of employees, or work hours used. For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees. Two thirds of the costs are allocated to the first department, and one third of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Allocation source|The allocation source establishes which costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Allocation target|The allocation targets determine where the costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Cost accounting|In cost accounting, actual costs of operations, processes, departments, or products are recorded. These costs are allocated to cost centers and cost objects by using different cost allocation methods. Managers use statistics and reports, such as cost distribution sheet and profit and loss analysis to make decisions and reduce costs. Cost accounting retrieves data from the general ledger, but works independently. Therefore transactions posted in cost accounting don't affect the data in the general ledger.|  
|Cost type|The chart of cost types has the same function as the chart of accounts in the general ledger. They're often structured similarly. Therefore it's possible to transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types and then modify it. The chart of cost types can also be created from scratch.|  
|Cost center|Cost centers are most often departments and profit centers that are largely responsible for company’s costs and income. Cost centers can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost centers and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost object|Cost objects are products, product groups or services of a company, the finished goods of a company, that in the end carries the costs. Cost objects can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost objects and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost allocation|Cost allocation is a process of allocating costs to cost centers or cost objects. For example, the wage of the truck driver of the sales department is allocated to the sales department cost center. It isn't necessary to allocate the wage cost to other cost centers. Another example is that the cost of an expensive computer system is allocated to the products of the company that use the system.|  
|Dynamic allocation|Dynamic allocations are dependent on changeable allocation bases, for example, the number of department employees, or the sales revenue of the project within a certain period of time. There are nine predefined dynamic allocation bases that users can define by using five filters.|  
|Direct cost|Direct costs are the costs that can be directly allocated to a cost object, for example, material purchase for a specific product.|  
|Fixed cost|Fixed costs are the costs that aren't dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the company. They tend to be time-related, such as salary or rent being paid per month. They are in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related, and are paid per quantity produced.|  
|Indirect cost|Indirect costs aren't directly accountable to a cost object, such as a particular function or product. Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs can be tax, administration, personnel, and security costs and are also known as overhead costs.|  
|Level|Level is used to define allocation order. Level is defined as a number between 1 and 99. The allocation posting follows the order of the levels. For example, level ensures that first administration is allocated to workshop before workshop is allocated to vehicle and production.|  
|Static allocation|Static allocations are based on a fixed set of values, for example, the square meters used, or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.|  
|Operational cost|Operational costs are the recurring expenses, which are related to the operation of a business, a device, and a component.|  
|Overhead cost|Overhead costs refer to ongoing expenses of operating a business. They're all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead costs include accounting fees, advertising, depreciation, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel, and utilities costs.|  
|Step variable cost|Step variable costs are costs that change dramatically at certain points because they involve large purchases that can't be spread out over time. For example, one employee can produce 100 tables in a month. The employee’s wage is constant over a production range of 1 to 100 tables. If the company wants to produce 110 tables, the company needs two employees. So the cost will double.|  
|Share|The portion or part that is allocated among cost centers or cost objects.|  
|Static weighting|Costs are allocated according to allocation keys, which can be modified by using a multiplier. <br />For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees that eat in the canteen. In the first department, only five employees eat in the canteen, so this department has a multiplier of 0.25. The basis for allocation is 20 x 0.25 = 5. The total number of employees that eat in the canteen is 15. One third of the costs are allocated to the first department and two thirds of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Variable cost|Variable costs are expenses that change in proportion to the activity of a business. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total costs.|  
|Variant|A variant is used as an optional user-defined label for allocations. The purpose of the label is to filter groups of allocation.|

# Inventory by Serial No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

If you track items by serial numbers, the **Inventory by Serial No.** report shows your total inventory per serial number. Use this report to track the performance of items on a serial by serial basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Serial No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory management and warehousing staff use this report to track inventory per serial number.

Inventory managers use the report to optimize stock levels for each serial number. This information can help identify slow moving inventory, so you can take corrective action. It can also help you find serial numbers that are due to expire.

The report gives warehouse staff a clear picture of the quantities of each serial number, so you can manage inventory efficiently and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Serial No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

# Configuring OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="url"></a>Get your OneDrive URL

[!INCLUDE[onedrive-url](includes/onedrive-url.md)]

## Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Run OneDrive setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Microsoft Entra ID registered app, the **Set Up Microsoft Entra ID** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. Learn more in [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it enables you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration 

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup leads you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Microsoft Entra app for authentication. The Microsoft Entra app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup changes your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Microsoft Entra app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already a Microsoft app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it compares the app configured in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, the Microsoft Entra app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration changes to use the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text: 

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.**

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. Learn more in the section [Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee).**

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup copies app configuration to the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, so it's used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations.**

### Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.

# Depreciate or amortize fixed assets

Depreciation is used to allocate the cost of fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, over their depreciable life. For each fixed asset, you must define how to depreciate it.  

 There are two ways to post depreciation:  

* Automatically, by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job.  
* Manually, by using the fixed asset G/L journal.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate daily depreciation, which allows you to calculate depreciation for any period. You can therefore analyze current operating results on, for example, a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The calculation uses a standard year of 360 days and a standard month of 30 days. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).  

If several departments use a fixed asset, periodic depreciation can be automatically allocated to these departments according to a user-defined allocation table.  

You can cancel incorrect depreciation entries by using the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. Afterward, you can post the correct amount by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job again. The errors you correct are posted as fixed asset error ledger entries.  

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. You can use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to recalculate the depreciation amounts.  

## To calculate depreciation automatically

Once a month, or whenever you choose, you can run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The batch job ignores fixed assets that were sold, are blocked or inactive, or use the manual depreciation method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **No. of Depreciation Days** field, you can see how many days of depreciation were calculated.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> Known limitation: If you set the **Use Force No. of Days** field to Yes, and the **Force No. of Days** field is set to a value where **Posting Date** minus **Number of Days** results in a date in the previous calendar year, the system will not let you post the depreciation.
> You can avoid it by reducing the **Force No. of Days** field to no more than than the calculated days until posting date using 30days/month OR set the flag **Fiscal Year 365 Days** in the Depreciation Book.
> We recommend the first option as you may not want to change the use of 30days/months for depreciation. For more information, see [Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#fiscal-year-365-days-field-depreciation).


## To post depreciation manually from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Depreciation**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for depreciation posting. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.  

The **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is updated accordingly.

If you set up fixed asset allocation keys to allocate amounts to different departments or projects, the amounts are allocated during posting. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).  

## To manage the ending book value

In the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page, you can specify the book value that you want your fixed asset to have in the current depreciation book after you fully depreciate it. You can enter the value manually, or you can fill in the **Default Ending Book Value** field on the related **Depreciation Book** page. The value automatically fills in the field.

> [!NOTE]
> If the last depreciation means that the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is zero, the last depreciation is automatically reduced by this amount.<br /><br />
> If the value in the **Book Value** field is greater than zero after the last depreciation,  for example because of a rounding problem or because a salvage value exists, the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is ignored. For more information, see [To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost](fa-how-acquire.md#to-post-the-salvage-value-together-with-the-acquisition-cost).

## To calculate allocations for a Fixed Asset


1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Related**, **Posting Group**, **Allocations** and then select **Depreciation**.
3. Fill in the G/L accounts and the corresponding allocation percentages for each posting group and then close the page.
4. Next, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
5. Enter the Fixed Asset and the corresponding FA Posting Group and Depreciation book will determine the allocation lines.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a fixed asset is used by several departments, you can select the dimension on the Fixed Asset G/L Journal line.

## Use duplication lists to prepare to post to multiple depreciation books

When you fill in journal lines to post to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal so you can post to a different depreciation book. For more information, see To [post entries to different depreciation books](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-post-entries-to-different-depreciation-books).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the depreciation book, and then select the **Part of Duplication List** check box.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you have selected the **Use Duplication List** field, do not use number series on the journal. The reason is that the number series for the fixed asset G/L journal does not the number series for the fixed asset journal.  

## To post entries to different depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the journal that you want to post depreciation with, select the **Use Duplication List** check box.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Fixed Asset Journal** page contains new lines for different depreciation books according to the duplication list.  
6. Review or edit the lines, and then choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Another way to duplicate an entry in a separate book is to enter a depreciation book code in the **Duplicate in Depreciation Book** field when you fill in a journal line.  

You can copy entries from one depreciation book to another by using the **Copy Depreciation Book** batch job. The batch job creates journal lines in the journal batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book that you want to copy to. To learn more, go to [To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books](#to-copy-fixed-asset-ledger-entries-between-depreciation-books).  

## To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant depreciation book card, and then choose the **Copy Depreciation Book** action.  
3. On the **Copy Depreciation Book** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The copied lines are created in either the fixed asset G/L journal or the fixed asset journal, depending on whether the depreciation book that you're copying has integration to the general ledger.

# Reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
You might sometimes have to handle payments to your bank account that can't be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. Reasons might be that no document exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that the payment can be applied to, or the related document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a different amount than the transaction amount, for example, because of currency exchange. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, all transaction amounts for payments that aren't yet applied appear in the **Difference** field, including amounts that can't be applied because of reasons such as the above.

The methods for resolving these types of unapplied payments:
* Apply manually
* Use text-to-account mapping
* Transfer an excess amount to a journal line to create and post the required entry, such as a refund of an overpayment.

Payments that can't be applied can appear on payment reconciliation journal lines in the following different ways:

* The value in the **Difference** field is equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that no part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry.
* The value in the **Difference** field is lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that a part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. The remaining part of the payment can't be applied and must be reconciled manually or by posting it directly to an account.

To reconcile such payments, you can choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action and then specify to which account the amount in the **Difference** field will be posted when you post the payment reconciliation journal. You can do this either from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page or from the **Payment Application Review** page that you open by choosing the value in the **Match Confidence** field or by choosing the **Difference** field.

> [!TIP]  
>   Similar functionality exists to set up automatic reconciliation of recurring payments that cannot be applied to related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entries. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

## To reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Transfer Difference to Account**. The **Transfer Difference to Account** page opens.
4. In the **Account Type** field, specify if the type of account that the payment amount will be posted to.
5. In the **Account No.** field, specify the account that the payment amount will be posted to.
6. In the **Description** field, specify text that describes this direct payment posting. By default, the text in the **Transaction Text** field on the payment reconciliation journal line is inserted.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

If the value in the **Difference** field was equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field when you post the payment reconciliation journal, the whole payment on the journal line will be posted directly to the specified balancing account.

If the value in the **Difference** field was lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, then an additional journal line will be created with the same text and date and with the difference inserted in the **Transaction Amount** field. On the original journal line, the difference will be deducted from the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, and the payment will remain applied to its related customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. When you post the payment reconciliation journal, one part of the payment will be posted as an applied payment. The other part of the payment will be posted directly to the specified account.

# Printer setup and management overview

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Printing documents and reports from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an important task for business users. You typically want to send print jobs directly to one of your organization's printers&mdash;no matter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client or app you're using. Because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is a cloud service, it can't directly reach local printers connected to users' devices, but you can connect it to cloud-enabled printers.

## What are your printer possibilities in Business Central

To support your print needs, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the following features:

|Feature|Description|Web client| Mobile app|App for Teams|
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
|Universal Print|Universal Print is a printer management solution available as a cloud service from Microsoft. With this feature, you can set up your printers in Universal Print, then register them for use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature requires a Universal Print subscription and the **Universal Print Integration** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Email Print|This feature lets you set up email-enabled printers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then sends print jobs to a printer using the printer's email address. This feature requires email-enabled printers, and the **Send to Email Printer** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Browser printing|The print features of your browser handle the print jobs. If a cloud printer isn't installed and set up, or if an installed printer fails, then printing defaults to the printing options for the browser. The **Printer** field on the report request page displays *(Handled by the browser)*.|![works online](media/check.png)|||

Most of the work for setting up printers can be done from the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although with Universal Print printers, you might also have to work in Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Business Central on-premises, Universal Print and Email Print require that Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is used.

## Custom printer extensions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports other custom printer extensions that add even more print features. So if you have any custom printer extensions installed, your application might include print features not described in this article.

If you're an AL developer and want to learn about how to create printer extensions, go to [Developing Printer Extensions in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reports-printing).

# Workflows in Business Central

You can set up and use workflows to connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows. System tasks can be preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports these types of workflows:
  
* Power Automate flows

  * Automated flows that are triggered by events (such as record or document creation, modification, or deletion) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also included are approval flows created in Power Automate that trigger when an approval is requested in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  * Instant flows that are manually triggered from the **Automate** action menu on lists, cards, and document pages.

    Create and manually trigger a Power Automate flow on a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, with options to manipulate information both internally and externally (using integrated tools).

* Approval workflows based on built-in workflow templates

  On the **Workflow Templates** page, you can see all available workflows. The trial version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many preconfigured workflows represented by workflow templates you can copy to create new ones. When you open a template from the **Workflow Templates** page, and the workflow name starts with *MS-*, then the template was added by Microsoft.

## Power Automate flows

With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can sign up for Power Automate to build powerful automated workflows. You run those workflows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The flows can connect internal and external data sources and tools, without coding knowledge.

## Approval workflows

Create an approval workflow by defining what starts the workflow and what happens next, as follows:

* A workflow event, which is moderated by event conditions.
* A workflow response, which is moderated by response options.

To define workflow steps, fill in fields on workflow lines using the event and response values that represent supported scenarios.

Examples of approval workflow events include the creation of sales or purchase orders/quotes/invoices, price changes, vendor or customer edits, and more.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# Set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service

You can import electronic bank statements from your bank to quickly fill on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page so you can apply payments and reconcile the bank account. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. This functionality is not supported for on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments hosted on Embed ISV application services. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a co-brand account from Envestnet, and you must add code to integrate with the Yodlee API.
>
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For technical assistance with the Envestnet Yodlee functionality, contact Microsoft Support. Do not contact Envestnet Yodlee. For more information, see [Configuring Technical Support for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support).

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is installed as an extension to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and is ready to be enabled in the supported countries/regions. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

After you enable the bank feed service, you must link a bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

* A bank account doesn't exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
* A bank account exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which you want to link to an online bank account.
* A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
* Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When the bank feed service is enabled, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statements into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page every two hours. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page won't be imported. For more information, see the “To enable automatic import of bank statements” section.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the Set Up Company assisted setup guide, some of the steps in the following procedures happen automatically when you get to the company bank account setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## To enable the bank feed service

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the bank account that you'll use for the bank feed service.
3. On the **Bank Account Card** page, in the **Bank Statement Import Format** field, select YODLEEBANKFEED.  

The bank feed service is enabled when you link a bank account to its related online bank account. See the next procedure.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide, then you enable the service by selecting the **Use a bank feed service** check box. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in Business Central](about-new-company.md).

## To create a new linked bank account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Create New Linked Bank Account**. The **Bank Account Linking** page opens after a few moments.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This page shows the actual web page of the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. Terminology and functionality on the page may not match instructions provided in this topic.  
3. On the **Online Bank Account Linking** page, in the **Link Account** pane, use the Search function to find the bank where you have one or more online bank accounts.
4. Choose the bank name. The **Log In** pane opens.
5. Enter the username and password that you use to sign in to the online bank, and then choose the **Next** button.  
6. The bank feed service prepares to link the first online bank account at the specified bank to a new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Set up reminder terms and levels

You can use reminders to inform customers about overdue amounts and to request payment. [!INCLUDE [reminder-terms](includes/reminder-terms.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you set up reminder terms and levels, you can include them in automated processes for creating, issuing, and sending reminders. To learn more about the automated process, go to [Automate reminders in collections](finance-automate-reminders.md).

## Reminder terms

If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send a reminder. In addition, you might want to debit their accounts for interest or fees. You can set up any number of reminder terms.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to calculate interest on overdue payments, you can do so when you create reminders. If, however, you just want to calculate interest and inform your customers about this without sending a reminder, use a [finance charge memo](finance-setup-finance-charges.md). For more information, see [Reminders](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#reminders) or [Finance Charges](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#finance-charges).

### Set up attachment and email body texts for communications

On the **Reminder Terms Setup** page, you can set up attachment texts and standard email messages to use either for all reminder levels, or create specific messages for each level. For example, the message you send for the first reminder level might have a different tone or content than the second or third. To create attachment and email message texts for all levels, choose **Customer Communication** at the top of the page. To create messages for specific lines, on the **Reminder Level** FastTab, choose a line and then choose the **Customer Communication** action on the FastTab.

By default, attachment and email texts use your language setting. If you issue reminders to customers in other countries, however, you might want to communicate in different languages. You can create texts for each language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports by using the **Add text for language** action. If you do, ensure that the languages are the same for attachment texts and email texts. If they don't match, and the reminder term has more than one level, the automation might not be able to customize the message for one or more levels. To verify that the languages match, use the **Overview communications** action and compare the communications for the texts.

When you send an email, the reminder is a report you attach to the email. You define the report that generates the reminder on the **Report Selection Reminder/Finance Charge** page, where you also select the report that holds the email body text in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. When you send emails to your customers, the texts on the **Email Text** FastTab are inserted in the report selected in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. The standard report has a text field for this text. If you want, you can edit this report, for example, to add or remove content. Edit the layout of these reports on the **Report Layouts** page. To learn more about report layouts, go to [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Communicating by email directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you're set up to do that. To learn more about connecting email accounts with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

### Set up reminder terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To use more than one combination of reminder terms, set up a code for each one.

## Reminder levels

For each reminder term, you can define an unlimited number of reminder levels, though most companies use only two or three levels. The first time a reminder is created for a customer, the setting from level 1 is used. When the reminder is issued, the level number is registered on the reminder entries that are created and linked to the individual customer ledger entries. If it's necessary to remind the customer again, all reminder entries linked to open customer ledger entries are checked to locate the highest level number. The conditions from the next level number will then be used for the new reminder.

If you create more reminders than you define levels for, the conditions for the highest level are used. You can create as many reminders as are allowed by the **Max. No of Reminders** field in the reminder terms.

### To set up reminder levels

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the line with the terms you want to set up levels for, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!TIP]
    > The setting of the **Calculate Interest** field determines if interest will appear on the reminder when the reminder is issued. However, the **Post Interest** field in the **Reminder Terms** page determines if the calculated interest must be posted to G/L and customer accounts.
    >
    > To indicate that interest should be calculated, choose the **Calculate Interest** field.

    Optionally, for each reminder level, specify extra fees in both local and foreign currencies. You can define many extra fees in foreign currencies for each code on the **Reminder Levels** page.  

    The extra fees can be calculated in three different ways that are defined by the value of the **Add. Fee Calculation Type** field.  

    - **Fixed**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the **Additional Fee** fields on the line for the reminder level itself.  
    - **Single Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the relevant line in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.
    - **Accumulated Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the combined lines in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.

4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Reminder Levels** page, define for each reminder level code and corresponding reminder level number a currency code and an extra fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create reminders in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create reminders. If there are no foreign currency reminder conditions set up, the LCY reminder conditions that are set up on the **Reminder Levels** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each reminder level, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the reminder.

6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill in the **Reminder Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the reminder text, you can enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.  

    |Placeholder|Value|  
    |-----------------|-----------|  
    |%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
    |%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the reminder header|  
    |%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
    |%8|Content of the **Reminder Level** field on the reminder header|  
    |%9|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the reminder header|  
    |%10|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%11|The company name|  
    |%12|Content of the **Add. Fee per Line** field on the reminder header|  

    For example, if you write **You owe %9 %7 due on %2.**, the reminder contains the following text: **You owe USD 1.200,50 due on 02-02-2024.**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the due date according to the date formula that you enter. For more information, see [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

8. To specify the language for an email message, choose the **Add text for language** action. The **Language Code** field updates to show your selection. On the **Email Text** FastTab, enter the content of the message in the selected language.

After you set up the reminder terms, you can assign them to customers on Customer Card pages. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

# Design Details: Assembly Order Posting
Assembly order posting is based on the same principles as when posting the similar activities of sales orders and production consumption/output. However, the principles are combined in that assembly orders have their own posting UI, like that for sales orders, while the actual entry posting happens in the background as direct item and resource journal postings, like that for production consumption, output, and capacity.  

Similarly to production order posting, the consumed components and the used resources are converted and output as the assembly item when the assembly order is posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.  

The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting:  

-   The item journal posts positive item ledger entries, representing output of the assembly item, from the assembly order header  
-   The item journal posts negative item ledger entries, representing consumption of assembly components, from the assembly order lines.  
-   The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources (time units), from the assembly order lines.  
-   The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage, from the assembly order lines.  

The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting.  

![Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_1.png "Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly.  

The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting:  

![Assembly-related entry flow during posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_2.png "AAssembly-related entry flow during posting")  

## Posting Sequence  
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order:  

1.  The assembly order lines are posted.  
2.  The assembly order header is posted.  

The following table outlines the sequence of actions.  

|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Initialize Posting|1.  Make preliminary checks.<br />2.  Add posting number and modify the assembly order header.<br />3.  Release the assembly order.|  
|Post|<ol><li>Create the posted assembly order header.</li><li>Copy comment lines.</li><li>Post assembly order lines (consumption):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Create a status page to calculate assembly consumption.</li><li>Get the remaining quantity on which the item journal line will be based.</li><li>Reset the consumed and remaining quantities.</li><li>For assembly order lines of type Item:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li></ol></li><li>For assembly order lines of type Resource:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line. This creates capacity ledger entries.</li><li>Create and post resource journal line.</li></ol></li><li>Transfer field values from the assembly order line into a newly created posted assembly order line.</li></ol></li><li>Post the assembly order header (output):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li><li>Reset the assembly quantities and remaining quantities.</li></ol></li></ol>|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unlike for production output, which is posted at expected cost, assembly output is posted at actual cost.  

## Cost Adjustment  
 Once an assembly order is posted, meaning that components (material) and resources are assembled into a new item, then it should be possible to determine the actual cost of that assembly item, and the actual inventory cost of the components involved. This is achieved by forwarding costs from the posted entries of the source (the components and resources) to the posted entries of the destination (the assembly item). The forwarding of costs is done by calculating and generating new entries, called adjustment entries that become associated with the destination entries.  

 The assembly costs to be forwarded are detected with the Order Level detection mechanism. For information about other adjustment detection mechanisms, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).  

### Detecting the Adjustment  
The order Level detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

-   Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
-   Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted.  

![Assembly-related entry flow during cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Assembly-related entry flow during posting")  

### Performing the Adjustment  
The spreading of detected adjustments from material and resource costs onto the assembly output entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job. It contains the Make Multilevel Adjustment function, which consists of the following two elements:  

-   Make Assembly Order Adjustment – which forwards cost from material and resource usage to the assembly output entry. Lines 5 and 6 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  
-   Make Single Level Adjustments – which forwards costs for individual items using their costing method. Lines 9 and 10 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  

![Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_4.jpg "Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Make WIP Adjustments element, in lines 7 and 8, is responsible for forwarding production material and capacity usage to the output of unfinished production orders. This is not used when adjusting assembly order costs as the concept of WIP does not apply to assembly.  

For information about how costs from assembly and production are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Assembly Costs are Always Actual  
 The concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly order posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

This is enabled by the following data structure.  

-   In the **Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Resource* is used to identify assembly resource entries.  
-   In the **Item Ledger Entry Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Assembly Output* and *Assembly Consumption* are used to identify the output assembly item entries and the consumed assembly component entries respectively.  

In addition, posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows.  

|Entity|Type|Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|  
|Assembly Order Header|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Resource||Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  

Accordingly, only actual costs are posted to the general ledger, and no interim accounts are populated from assembly order posting. For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md)  

## Assemble to Order  
The item ledger entry that results from posting an assemble-to-order sale is fixed applied to the related item ledger entry for the assembly output. Accordingly, the cost of an assemble-to-order sale is derived from the assembly order that it was linked to.  

Item ledger entries of type Sale that result from posting assemble-to-order quantities are marked with **Yes** in the **Assemble to Order** field.  

Posting sales order lines where a part is inventory quantity and another part is assemble-to-order quantity results in separate item ledger entries, one for the inventory quantity and one for the assemble-to-order quantity.  

### Posting dates

In general, posting dates are copied from a sales order to the linked assembly order. The posting date in the assembly order is automatically updates when you change the  posting date in the sales order directly or indirectly, such as if you change the posting date in the wareshouse shippment, inventory pick, or as part of a bulk posting.

You can change the posting date in the assembly order manually. However, it can not be later then posting date in the linked sales order. The system will keep this date unless you update the posting date in the sales order.

# Define document layouts for customers and vendors

Document layouts use report layouts to define the look and feel of documents that you send to customers and vendors. Business Central provides standard layouts, but you can also tailor custom layouts for each of your business partners. Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md). You select standard and custom document layouts from customer and vendor cards by choosing the **Document Layouts** action. The value in the **Usage** field defines the process for which the document layout is used. For example, for customers, you might use **Reminder**, **Shipment**, and **Confirmation** types of document layouts.

Document layouts can also save you time when you send documents to customer or vendor contacts by email. For each layout that you assign to the customer or contact, you can by specify one or more contact email addresses. For example, you can send an invoice to the customer's purchasing and warehouse contacts. Adding contact email addresses is easy. On the **Document Layouts** page, the **Select Email from Contacts** action let's you choose from a list of the contact email addresses that you registered for the customer or vendor. You can also add email addresses manually. If you enter multiple addresses, separate them with a semi-colon, and don't add spaces between the addresses.

Before you define which document layout to use for which processes, and which contact to send the document to, load all the available reports (documents) from the **Report Selections** page. You can quickly load the documents by using the **Copy from Report Selection** action on the **Document Layouts** page.

The steps in the following sections describe how to define sales document layouts from the **Customer Card** page. For vendors, the steps are the same from the **Vendor Card** page.

## Load the standard document layouts for sales documents for a customer

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then choose the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, choose the **Copy from Report Selection** action.

The **Document Layouts** page displays all layouts that are available for sales documents.

## Select a report layout to use for the sales document layout

The following steps assume that layout you want for the type of document is already created. Learn more about creating layouts in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then select the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for document layout that you want to use a report layout for, set the **Email Body Layout** and **Email Attachment Layout** fields. You can choose different layouts for each.

   >![!NOTE]
   > If you want to use a legacy custom report layout, set the layout in the **Custom Layout Description** field. By default, the **Custom Layout Description** field is hidden. If the field isn't available, you can personalize the page to add it. To personalize the page, select the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="The Settings icon."::: icon, and then select **Personalize**. Learn more about legacy custom report layouts in [(Legacy) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md)

## Specify which contact receives which document layout for a customer

To save time when you send documents to customer and vendor contacts by email, specify their email addresses on document layouts. For example, you can always send customer statements to their accountant contacts and sales orders to their purchasers, or purchase orders to vendor salespeople.

1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for a report layout that you want to send to a specific contact for the customer, select the **Select Email from Contacts** action.
1. On the **Contacts** page, select one or more contacts, and then select **OK**.

# Calculate Dates for purchases

If you want to have items in inventory on a certain date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically calculate the date on which you must order them. 

The result is the date on which you can pick the items that you ordered.  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, the calculated order date is the date on which you must place the order. The date on which the items will be available for picking displays in the **Expected Receipt Date** field.  

If you don't specify a requested receipt date, the date you expect to receive the items is based on order date on the line. 

The receipt date is also the date when the items will be available for picking.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, many of the date fields this article mentions are hidden on purchase order lines. If a field isn't available, you can add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Calculating with a requested receipt date

If there's a requested receipt date on the purchase order line, that date is the basis for the following calculations:  

- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date  
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, that date is assigned to new lines as you create them. You can change or remove the date on the lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested receipt date to get the order date, we recommend that you use date formulas that have fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. For more information about date formulas, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating without a requested receipt date

If you enter a purchase order line without a requested receipt date, the **Order Date** field on the line shows the date in the **Order Date** field on the purchase order header. This date is either the date you entered or the work date. The dates are then calculated for the purchase order line, with the order date as the starting point, as follows:  

- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date  
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you change the order date on the line, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the other dates.  

## Default values for lead time calculation

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the date formula in the **Lead Time Calculation** field on the purchase order line to calculate the order and expected receipt dates.  

You can manually specify the date formula on lines. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the formulas that are defined on the following pages in this order of priority:

1. Item/Vendor Catalog
2. Item Card
3. Stockkeeping Unit Card
4. Vendor Card

# Archive documents

You can archive sales, purchase, and service orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders. If you're using Project Management features, you can also archive your projects. You can archive documents and projects several times. A different archived version saves each time.

For sales documents, if the original still exists and isn't posted, you can use the **Restore** action to overwrite it with an archived version.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only restore sales documents and projects. The action isn't available for archived purchase documents.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can reuse the content by copying the data, for example, by using the **Copy from Document** action.  

To explore archived documents, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Archive**, and then choose the related link. If the archive you're interested in doesn't display right away in the **Go to Reports and Analysis** section, you might need to choose **Show more**.

## To set up automatic document archiving

You can automate archiving to create a new version of the archived document when someone does the following things:

* Changes the status or deletes a document or project.
* Prints, downloads, or sends a document by email.
* Converts a quote to an order or invoice.
* Posts an order.

The following steps describe how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents from the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. The steps are similar for purchase documents and projects.

* For purchase documents, use the **Purchase & Payables** page.
* For projects, use the **Project Setup** page.
* For services, use the **Service Management Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Archiving** FastTab, specify whether to turn on automatic archiving for the various types of sales documents. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

The following table describes the options for the **Archive Quotes** field.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Never**| Don't archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Question**|Prompt the user to choose whether to archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Always**|Archive a sales quote automatically when you delete it.|

## To manually archive a sales order

The following procedure describes how to manually archive a sales order. The steps are similar for all documents and projects that you can archive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a sales order that you want to archive.  
3. Choose the **Archive Document** action.

The sales order is archived. You can view it on the **Archived Sales Orders** page.

## To restore a nonposted sales document or a project from the archive

You can restore documents only if the original document isn't posted.

The following procedure describes how to restore an archived sales order to the original sales order. The steps are similar for all orders, blanket orders, return orders, and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order Archives**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the archived sales order, or version of it, that you want to restore, and then choose the **Restore** action.  

The contents of the original sales order or project are replaced with the archived version.

## To delete archived versions

Use a retention policy to clean up archived versions that you no longer need. Retention policies let administrators define how long they want to store data. For example, they can set up a policy that deletes data after an expiration date. To learn more, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

There are a few things to note about creating retention policies for archived documents and projects:

* If the original document isn’t deleted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you can’t delete the archived versions. Archived versions don’t expire as long as the original exists.
* When you set up the retention policy, you can specify that you want the policy to delete all archived versions except the most recent. For example, you might have 10 versions and want to keep a copy of the latest. 
* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the expiration date for documents based on the date of the most recent archived version.

# Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs

You must set up repair status options that identify the progress of repair and maintenance of service items in service orders. You must set up at least nine repair status options that identify situations or actions taken when servicing service items.  

You can set the priority level for service order status options. The four priorities are **High**, **Medium High**, **Medium Low**, and **Low**.  

When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  

Before you can set up a repair status, you must set up service status priorities.

## To set up service status priorities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service order status you want to set a priority for.  
3. In the **Priority** field, choose the priority you want for this service order status.  

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have set the priority for each of the four status options: **Pending**, **In Process**, **Finished**, and **On Hold**.  

## To set up a repair status

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Repair Status**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new repair status.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Service Order Status** field, choose the order status to link the repair status to. The **Priority** field displays the priority of the service order status you have chosen.  
5. Choose a repair status. You can choose only one. A repair status cannot be linked more than one repair status option.  
6. To be able to post service orders, including service items, with this repair status, choose the **Posting Allowed** field.  
7. To be able to manually change the service order status option to **Pending** in service orders including service items with this repair status, choose the **Pending Status Allowed** check box.  
8. Choose the **In Process Status Allowed**, **Finished Status Allowed**, and **On Hold Status Allowed** check boxes in the same way.

Repeat these steps for each of the repair status options you want to create.

# Delete Approval Workflows

If you're certain a workflow is no longer being used, you can delete it. All workflow step instances defined in the workflow must have a **Completed** status.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you delete a workflow, all information in the workflow is lost.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

## Delete a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the workflow you want to delete.
3. Choose the **Delete** action.
4. Alternatively, open the workflow you want to delete.
5. On the **Workflow** page, choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a workflow requires it to be disabled. To disable a workflow, open it in the **Workflows** page, then turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

# Manage and reconcile your bank accounts

A bank reconciliation should be completed at regular intervals for all your bank accounts to ensure that the company's cash records are correct. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

You can perform the task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page where you match (reconcile) bank statement lines in the left-hand pane with your internal bank account ledger entries in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page as part of processing the payments that are represented on a bank statement. On both pages, you can fill in the bank statement information by importing a file or feed and you can use automatic matching suggestions.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the North American versions, you can also perform bank reconciliation on the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, deselect the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

Before you can manage your bank accounts within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up each bank account as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Setting Up Banking](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

> [!TIP]
> Use bank reconciliation to help verify that your books are up-to-date, and do not post the reconciliation until you are satisfied with the reconciliation.

# Sales by Item (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Item** report gives a clear picture of your organization's item sales. It showcases key metrics for each item or item category. For example, the sales amount, quantities, and the cost amounts. You can break down the information further by the specific customers that buy the items.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Item Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify which items aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Category
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

As a developer or advanced user, it helps to inspect the data that is generated for a given report dataset while you create new reports or modify existing ones. To support this capability, you can export a report dataset as raw data to an Excel workbook or XML file&mdash;directly. In Excel, for example, you can then do ad-hoc analysis of the data and diagnose issues.

## Get started

To export a report dataset to an Excel workbook or XML file, open the report in the client, then in the request page, select **Send to** > **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** or **XML Document**. The file downloads to your device.

## More about Excel (data only)

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports the report results and the criteria used to generate them&mdash;but it doesn't include the report layout. The Excel file includes the full dataset, as raw data, arranged in rows and columns. All data columns of the report's dataset are included, regardless of whether they're used in the report layout.

Once you have the Excel file, you can start analyzing the data. For example, you could filter the data and use Power Pivot to display it.

Each time you export results, a new worksheet is created. Using the **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option, you can run the same report and reuse formatting changes. For example, for Power Pivot, you can run the report again for another time period, copy the results to the worksheet, and then refresh the worksheet. You can also find a reporting app on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't export a report that has more than 1,048,576 rows or 16,384 columns. With Business Central on-premises, the maximum number of exported rows might be even less. Business Central Server includes a configuration setting, called **Max Data Rows Allowed to Send to Excel**, for decreasing the limit from the maximum value. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General) or contact your administrator.

## For administrators

- **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** was introduced as an optional feature in the 2021 release wave 1, update 18.3. To give users access to this feature when running 2021 release wave 1, enable the **Save report dataset to Microsoft Excel Document** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management). In 2021 release wave 2, this feature became permanent.

- To use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, user accounts need the **Allow Action Export Report Dataset To Excel** permission. You can give users this permission by assigning either the **Troubleshooting Tools** or **Export Report Excel** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md)  

## For developers and advanced users

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports all columns, including columns that hold filters and formatting instructions for other values. Here are a few points of interest:

- Binary data in a field, like an image, isn't exported.

  In columns that hold binary data, fields include the text **Binary data ({0} bytes)**, where **{0}** indicates the number of bytes.
- The Excel file also includes the **Report Metadata** worksheet.

  This worksheet shows the filters applied to the report and general report properties, like the name, ID, and extension details. The filters are shown in the **Filter (DataItem::Table::FilterGroupNo::FieldName)** column. The filters in this column include filters set on the report's request page. It also includes filters defined in AL code, for example, by the [DataItemLink property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemlink-reports-property) and [DataItemTableView property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemtableview-property).

# Frequently asked questions about the Power BI apps in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses do I need?

To use the Power BI apps, you need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses for the following users:

- Users who install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps.
- Users who refresh the report data.
- Users who access the reports.

Alternatively, you can use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)].

To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central (prerequisites)](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites).

## Why do I need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses?

You must have [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses for the following reasons:

1. You must install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps from Microsoft AppSource.
2. You must share a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace.

The use of free license alternative for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] allows you to embed your own reports. Anything in the free [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] license must be present in your personal [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace. So, the free license alternative does not work with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps.

## Can I install the same app multiple times for different companies or environments?

Yes. Just rename the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace after installing the app.

To learn more, see [Rename a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace](/power-bi/create-reports/service-rename#rename-a-workspace).

## Can I use the same app to do reporting across multiple companies or environments?

No. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## How do I refresh the data in an app?

To learn more, go to [Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)](./across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#get-the-latest-data-refresh-the-semantic-model).

## My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

## I can't see any dimension data in my reports

Check whether the job queue entry for updating dimension set data is stopped.

To learn more, go to [Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#job-queue-entry-for-updating-dimension-set-entries).

## How do I change the connection parameters for an app?

To learn more, go to [Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#connect-the-power-bi-semantic-models-to-business-central).

## How do I update an app?

To learn more, go to [Updating a Power BI app](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#updating-a-power-bi-app).

## Can I get a copy of the source code (.pbix files) for the apps?

No. At the moment, the source code (.pbix files) for the apps isn't available. However, its availability might change in a later release.

## Are the apps available for on-premises installations?

No. At the moment, the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are only available for online environments.

# Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze finance data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets over time", "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of finance processes:

- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)
- [G/L Registers](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=116&layout=analysis)
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios in finance

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of finance scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on finance

When you post journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **G/L Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on general finance is typically done on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20) page. For accounts receivable and payable, you can analyze [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) and [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29), respectively.

title: Data ownership models for synchronization

# Data ownership models for synchronization

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires that you specify an owner for the data you store. For more information, see [Types of tables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) in the Power Apps documentation. When you set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must choose the **User or team** ownership for records that are synchronized. Actions that can be performed on these records can be controlled on a user level. <!--We recommend the Team ownership model because it makes it easier to manage ownership for multiple people.NO LONGER TRUE IN DATAVERSE-->

## Team Ownership
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a company is a legal and business table that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit table, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To make synchronization possible, when you enable synchronization for a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following happens in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* We create a company table that is equivalent to the company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The name of the company is suffixed with "BC Company ID." For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create a default business unit that has the same name as the company. For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create separate owner team with the same name as the company and associate it with the business unit. The name of the team is prefixed with "BCI -." For example, BCI - Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* Records that are created and synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are assigned to the "BCI Owner" team that is linked to the business unit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you rename a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the names of the company, business, and team that we create automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are not updated. Because only the company ID is used for integration, this does not affect synchronization. If you want the names to match you must update the company, business unit, and team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

![The root business unit is on top, the teams are in the center, and then the companies are at the bottom.](media/cds_bu_team_company.png)

In this configuration, records that are related to the Cronus US company will be owned by a team that is linked to the Cronus US business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unit–level visibility in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The Sales Manager role is assigned to members of the Cronus US Sales team.
* Users who have the Sales Manager role can access account records for members of the same business unit.
* The Cronus US Sales team is linked to the Cronus US business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the Cronus US Sales team can see any account that is owned by the Cronus US user, which would have come from the Cronus US company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new EUR (Europe) root business unit is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both Cronus DE (Gernamy) and Cronus ES (Spain). The EUR business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the EUR Sales team access to account data in both Cronus DE and Cronus ES by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI row. When a BCI record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an table, administrators can change the owning team, but a team must always be assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Records become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.

## Choosing a different business unit
You can change the business unit selection if you are using the Teams ownership model. If you use the Person ownership model, the default business unit is always selected. 

If you choose another business unit, for example, one that you created earlier in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], it will keep its original name. That is, it will not be suffixed with the company ID. We will create a team that does use the naming convention.

When changing a business unit, you can choose only the business units that are one level below the root business unit.

## Person Ownership
If you choose the Person ownership model you must specify each salesperson who will own new records. The business unit and team are created as described in the [Team Ownership](admin-cds-company-concept.md#team-ownership) section.

The default business unit is used when the Person ownership model is chosen, and you cannot choose another business unit. The team that is associated with the default business unit will own records for common tables, such as the Product table, that are not related to specific salespersons.

When you couple salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will add the user to the default team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. You can verify that users are added by looking at the **Default Team Member** column on the **Users - Common Data Service** page. If the user is not added, you can add them manually by using the **Add Coupled Users to Team** action. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in Business Central with Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

# Set Up Cash Customers

You cannot create an invoice without a customer number. This is true, even if you make a cash sale and do not have anything to record in a customer account.  

## To set up a cash customer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new **Customer** card. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
3. In the **No.** field, enter **Cash**, for example.  
4. In the **Name** field, enter **Cash Sale**, for example.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **Customer Posting Group** and the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields.  

 Now you have set up a customer that contains sufficient information for invoicing.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You may have chosen a posting group that is also used for domestic credit sales. If you want to maintain separate data on cash sales, for example, with a special sales or receivables account, you can set up an extra posting group for this purpose.  
>
> You must enter a number for a receivables account for the posting group, even though the balance in this account will always be 0 after you post an invoice.

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. You can't post usage or sales for the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Set up information for contacts

When you create contacts you can enter information about them, such as:

- The industry the contact belongs to.
- Your business relationship with them.

Before you create contacts and record details about your business relationships, you must set up some of the information that you assign to them. For example:

- Mailing groups
- Industry groups
- Business relations
- Web sources
- Organizational levels
- Job responsibilities

You can set up this information on their pages, or from the Contact Card page by choosing the **New** action in the drop-down menu for the fields.  

This information helps you organize your contacts so they're easier to find when you want to communicate with them. For example, you can find all contacts based on a certain group.

## To assign industry groups to a contact

Industry groups indicate the type of industry that your contacts are in. For example, the retail industry or the automobile industry.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign industry groups to contacts of type **Company**.

The industry group code defines the type or category of the group, such as ADVERT for advertising, or PRESS, for TV and radio. You can have several industry group codes. Define industry groups on the **Industry Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Company** action, and then the **Industry Groups** action. The **Contact Industry Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Industry Groups Code** field, select the industry groups you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many industry groups as you want. You can also assign industry groups from the contact list by following the same procedure.

<!--The number of industry groups that you assigned to the contact displays in the **No. of Industry Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page. -->

After you assign industry groups to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign mailing groups to a contact

You can use mailing groups to identify groups of contacts that you want to send the same information to. For example, you can set up a mailing group for the contacts that you want to notify about an office move, or a group for sending holiday gifts.

The mailing group code defines the type or category of the group, such as MOVE for office move, or GIFT for holiday gift. You can have several mailing group codes. Define mailing groups on the **Mailing Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Mailing Groups** action. The **Contact Mailing Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Mailing Groups Code** field, select the mailing group that you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many mailing groups as you want. You can also assign mailing groups from the contact list.

<!--The number of mailing groups you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Mailing Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page.-->

After you assign mailing groups to your contacts, you can use the information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Define an alternate address for a contact

You can assign an alternate address where your contact sometimes wants to receive mail and information. For example, their vacation home. You can also assign date ranges that specify when to use each alternate address.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Card** action.

    To define that the alternate address applies in a specific period, choose the **Date Range** action instead.
3. On the **Contact Alt. Address List** page, enter a new alternate address and fill in the fields on the **Contact Alternative Address** page.

Repeat these steps to assign as many alternate addresses as you want. You can specify one or more date ranges for each alternate address.

## Assign job responsibilities to a contact

You can add information about the job responsibilities of contact persons to indicate what the contact person is responsible for. For example, IT, management, or production.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only specify job responsibilities for contacts of the type **Person**.

The job responsibility code defines the type or category of the job, such a MARKETING or PURCHASE. You can have several job responsibility codes. Define job responsibilities on the **Job Responsibilities** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Job Responsibilities** action. The **Contact Job Responsibilities** page opens.
3. In the **Job Responsibility Code** field, select the job responsibility.

Repeat these steps to assign as many job responsibilities as you want. You can also assign job responsibilities from the contact list.

<!--The number of job responsibilities you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Job Responsibilities** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign organizational levels to a contact

You can use organizational levels on your contacts to specify where they are in their company. For example, top management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign organizational levels to contacts of the type **Person**.

The organizational level code defines the type or category of the organizational level, such a CEO or CFO. You can have several organizational level codes. Define organizational levels on the **Organizational Levels** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. In the **Organizational Levels** field, select the code you want to assign.

After you assign organizational levels to your contacts, you can use this information to create segments.

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign web sources to a contact

You can use web sources with your contact companies to identify, for example, web sites that you want to use to search for information about the contacts. When assigning web sources, you specify which search engine and search word to use to find the requested information.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign web sources to contacts of the type **Company**.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Web Sources** action. The **Contact Web Sources** page opens.
3. In the **Web Source Code** field, choose the web source you want to assign.
4. In the **Search Word** field, enter the search word that you want to use to find the information.

Repeat these steps to assign as many web sources as you want.

## Assign business relations to a contact

Business relations indicate the business relationship you have with your contacts. For example, a prospect, bank, consultant, service supplier, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign business relations to contacts of the type **Company**.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.
3. On the **Contact Business Relations** page, in the **Business Relation Code** field, select the business relation you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many business relations as you want.

<!--The number of business relations you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Business Relations** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign business relations to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Copy information from contact companies to contact persons

Some information about contact companies is the same for their contact persons. For example, the address details. On the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can specify which fields on the contact card for a company is copied to the contact card for a person each time you create a contact person for the contact company.

When you change the value in one of these fields on the contact company card, the same fields on the contact person card update. The exception is if you manually changed the field on the contact person card.

To learn more, go to [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use predefined default settings on new contacts

You can use the **Defaults** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify default values that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns to new contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The settings for inheritance overwrite the default values you set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns German as the language code for the contact persons for that company.

## Synchronize contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts

To synchronize the contact card with a linked customer, vendor, or bank account, fill in the relevant field in the **Bus. Relation Code for** section on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.  

To learn more, go to [Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

## Search for duplicate contacts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact. Or, you can search manually after you create a contact. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the search strings automatically each time you change a contact's information or create a contact. You can specify the **Search Hit %**, that is, the percentage of identical strings that two contacts must have to consider them as duplicates. You enter the percentage on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.

When you find a duplicate contact, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page to merge it with a contact record that you want to keep. To learn more, go to [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md).

# Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

Users can access Business Central data in Microsoft Teams using their Microsoft 365 license. This article answers frequently asked questions from administrators, consultants and others. Developers should refer to the Developer FAQ. For questions about integrating Business Central with Microsoft Teams, go to [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## [Permissions](#tab/permissions) 

### Can I proactively configure different starting permissions for different groups of users?

Not at this time. Business Central only allows configuring one group of permissions that are assigned to all Microsoft 365 users when they sign into Business Central for the first time.

### Can I proactively configure permissions, profiles, and settings for individual users before they sign in?

Yes. It can be achieved through security groups. By applying a security group to an environment, you define the total set of users that have access to that environment. This security group can include users with a Business Central license and users with a Microsoft 365 license. When you next update users from Microsoft 365 in the **Users** list, the Microsoft 365 user records will be created. You can then assign user groups, permissions, profiles, and other settings before they've signed in.

### After a user signs in, can I change which objects they have access to?

Yes. After a user has signed in for the first time and their user record has been provisioned, administrators manage those users just like any other Business Central user. For example, they can add or remove permissions to different objects. If you change the permission sets assigned to the Microsoft 365 license in the License Configuration page, the change will only affect the next users that sign in for the first time.

### How do I prevent access to sensitive tables?

Business Central offers a powerful and flexible permission model where administrators can define permission sets that grant access to specific objects, business processes or entire roles. To prevent access to sensitive tables, you can create custom permission sets that exclude permission to sensitive objects. For more information about exclude permissions, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Instead of customizing the License Configuration, can I customize a user group?

Yes. Adding permission sets to the Microsoft Teams Internal Users user group in Business Central, has the same net effect as adding permission sets to the Microsoft 365 license, as long as the Microsoft 365 license continues to map to this user group. This approach has the added benefit that permission sets are always synchronized with members of the group whenever you modify the user group.

### When a Business Central user shares a record in Teams, do they grant new permissions?

No. This action isn't the same as sharing a link to a SharePoint document where the person sharing the document can choose to grant permission to others. In Business Central, only administrators can configure and assign permissions. When compared to sharing SharePoint documents, it's the equivalent of choosing the option to “Share to people with existing access”.

### Does this feature support row-level security?

Yes. Even though a person accessing a record in Teams with their Microsoft 365 license may have the correct table and page object permissions, row-level permissions will be enforced if it' been implemented for that table.  

### If I configure permissions that include write access, will users be able to write in Teams?

If you configure Business Central to assign a permission set that includes insert, modify, or delete access to one or more objects, users with that permission set will still not be able to write in Teams when they only have a Microsoft 365 license. The Business Central service enforces read-only access no matter what insert, modify, or delete permission you assign.  

Even though Business Central provides this level of protection, we still recommend that you avoid permission sets with write access. Doing so prevents issues further downstream when users change role or acquire new licenses.  

## [Setup and Configuration](#tab/setup)

### Why is the setting to enable access not available for my environment?

Enabling access with Microsoft 365 licenses is only available for Business Central environments of platform version 21.1 or later. When your environment is upgraded to this minimum version, the setting automatically becomes available. To check the version of your environment, go to the environment details page for the environment in the Business Central admin center. Or, sign in to the environment, and go to the **Help & Support** page from the **Help** menu.

### Can I access Business Central on premises with Microsoft 365 licenses?

No, it's not supported. Business Central displays an error when users try to access Business Central on premises records in Teams.

### What is the Employee profile?

The **Employee** profile displayed in the **Profiles (Roles)** list page was introduced with Update 21.1. It's the default profile assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. This profile's intended for people in an organization who don't have a specific role in Business Central and only need to view data that was shared with them.

### What is the Teams Users user group?

The **Microsoft Teams Internal Users** group displayed in the **User Groups** page was introduced with Update 21.1. This group is the default user group assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. The user group's intended for people within the same organization where Business Central is hosted that collaborate in Microsoft Teams.  

### Do users that only have a Microsoft 365 license show up in the Users list in Business Central?

Yes. If you apply security groups to environments, those users will show up in the Users list after you use the Update Users from Microsoft 365 action from the **Users** list. If you don't apply security groups, user records appear in the Users list after the first time they access a Business Central record.

### Does this feature work for embed ISV solutions?

Yes. Users with only a Microsoft 365 license can also access records in environments that run under the *.bc.dynamics.com domain.

## [Licensing](#tab/license)

### Can a customer use this feature if they don't have Business Central?

Accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license is intended for organizations that already subscribe to Business Central and operate one or more Business Central environments with licensed Business Central users. It provides no new functionality or use rights to Microsoft 365 customers that don't have a Business Central plan.

### How does this help me manage subscription costs in my organization?

To maximize productivity and streamline their operations, SMBs often purchase Dynamics 365 Business Central together with Microsoft 365. In which case, most people receive a Microsoft 365 license, but only specific roles or people receive a Business Central license. Business Central provides licensing flexibility so that customers pay only for what they need:

- Users requiring full access to Business Central are typically assigned a Business Central Essentials or Business Central Premium license. 
- Users requiring limited write access are typically assigned a Business Central Team Member license.
- All other employees across the organization that only need to occasionally read business data that is shared with them, can do so if they have a Microsoft 365 license. They don't have to be assigned a Team Member license. Other licensing options are available. For more information, download and read the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

### Is this 100% free of charge?
 
No. Accessing Business Central data in Microsoft Teams requires each user to have either a Business Central license or a Microsoft 365 license from the list of supported plans.

### Does this work with Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials?

Yes. If a user is assigned a Microsoft 365 license from a trial of a supported plan, they can also access Business Central records in Teams. It's then possible for customers to try Microsoft productivity and business apps working together, and allows partner salespeople and consultants to easily demonstrate this feature. For example, partners can provision their own Microsoft Entra tenants from [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX) that include Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials for demonstrating Business Central.

### The list of licenses in Business Central shows a Microsoft 365 license. What's that?

The **License Configuration** page in Business Central displays the different types of licenses that can provide access to the Business Central service. In version 21, Microsoft added Microsoft 365 to this list as a new way to access Business Central. This list of licenses doesn't imply that your organization has purchased subscriptions to any of these licenses or your organization has enabled access through those licenses.

### Do I need to acquire a new type of Microsoft 365 license for this feature to work?  

Microsoft hasn't created new licenses or new plans to power this feature. This feature relies entirely on existing Microsoft 365 plans and licenses. If you already subscribe to one of the supported Microsoft 365 plans, then you already have this new use right. Learn more about the supported plans in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams). Otherwise, if you don't subscribe to Microsoft 365 today, you can sign up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium or similar plan. Learn more in [Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365).

### How do I find out which users have only a Microsoft 365 license?

There are multiple ways. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Active Users** list and refer to the **Licenses** column. In Business Central, go to the **Users** list, choose any of the users and view the **Licenses** FactBox.  

### How do I filter the Users list in Business Central to see users that only have a Microsoft 365 license?

This task is currently not possible using a filter or list view. However, you can select a user in the list and view the Licenses FactBox that will include only Microsoft 365, if the user only has a Microsoft 365 license.

### What about users that have both a Microsoft 365 license and a Business Central license?

When multiple licenses are assigned to a user, the greater license use rights win over lesser license use rights when accessing Business Central. In this case, Business Central license entitles the user to more user rights. So, users can read and write Business Central records in Teams and access the Business Central web client in the browser, just like any other Business Central license-holder. If specific permission sets have been configured for the Microsoft 365 license, the user gets the configured permission sets combined with the permission sets from the Business Central license or that have already been assigned to the user.

### Is this licensing related to the Business Central Team Member license?

There's no relation between Business Central Team Member licenses and accessing Business Central in Microsoft Teams using Microsoft 365 licenses. Although Microsoft Teams and its documentation refer to people in a team as *team members*, it's a collective term for a group of Microsoft Teams users. It doesn't refer to Business Central licenses.

### Does Business Central enforce any of the constraints?

Yes, all of the platform constraints and minimum requirements, including licensing requirements, are enforced by the Business Central platform. This guides users with specific error messages to help them troubleshoot their setup, and prevent abuse. For example, if a user that only has a Microsoft 365 license attempts to access the Business Central web client in the browser, access will be denied and a guiding error message will be displayed. 

## [Usage](#tab/usage)
 
### Can I access records on Teams for iOS and Teams for Android? 

Currently, it isn't possible to access Business Central data on the Teams mobile using only a Microsoft 365 license. Microsoft is working on enabling this capability shortly. 

### How do users change their personal settings in My Settings? 

When a user accesses Business Central for the first time using only their Microsoft 365 license, their user settings such as language, time zone and regional settings are automatically set based on their operating system or browser settings. Administrators can modify these settings from Business Central for each user. 

### What determines the choice of language when you sign in for the first time? 

The language with which you experience Business Central is set based on various factors, including the Teams client through which you accessed Business Central the first time. For Teams desktop app, Teams for iOS and Teams for Android, the operating system language is applied. For Teams for the web, the browser language is applied. In all cases, the Teams language isn't considered. 

### Why can’t I activate some of the colored links in tabs and card details?

Actionable links on Business Central pages are often shown as a bold hyperlinks that can be activated to go elsewhere or run some operation. At a technical level, these links are typically implemented as field values with no caption that trigger some code and where the choice of style often reflects state. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, the links are styled as if they're actionable. But they can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions.  

### Why can’t I activate page notification actions?

Contextual notifications shown on pages are often accompanied by actionable links. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, these links are displayed, but can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions. At a technical level, these links are implemented as actions.

### Can Microsoft 365 users remove tabs?

Yes. Anyone in the chat or channel can remove tabs created by others. Removing a tab doesn't remove or affect data in Business Central, but the tab will be removed for all users in the chat or channel.

### If I can't filter, will I still see a filtered list that was created by others?

Users accessing Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license don't have the use rights to filter using the filter pane or apply list views. But, if another user has created a tab containing a filtered list page, Microsoft 365 users will also view those filters applied to the tab.
