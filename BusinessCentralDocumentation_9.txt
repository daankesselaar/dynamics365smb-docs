# Australian business numbers and adjustment notes

An Australian Business Number (ABN) is a single identifier for all business dealings with the tax office, and for dealings with other government departments and agencies.  

ABNs and adjustment notes—or credit memos—are used to satisfy tax requirements.  

## ABN

All companies must register and apply for an ABN to report the details of payment summaries issued to their payees during the financial year. The payment summary includes the Tax File Numbers (TFN) or business numbers of the payees.  

## Adjustment notes

Adjustment notes are issued by suppliers to a business when the amount of consideration for taxable supplies changes. The recipient needs an adjustment note to claim more or less GST credits than previously claimed.  

Section 19-10 of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 defines an adjustment event as any event that has the effect of:  

- Canceling a supply or acquisition.  
- Changing the consideration for a supply or acquisition.  
- Causing a supply or acquisition to start or stop being a taxable supply or creditable acquisition.  

An adjustment event may result in an increase or decrease to your net amount for the tax period.  

Adjustment notes—or credit memos—should be connected to an invoice.  

Because credit memos are used for adjustment notes, each credit memo should satisfy all of the legal requirements for an adjustment note. Each credit memo should have an original invoice number, date, and reason code assigned to it. The following fields are included in the adjustment note:  

- **Adjustment Applies to**: The number of the document to which the adjustment note applies. If you use the **Copy Document** function, this field populates automatically. You must enter a reason code before the transaction can be posted. You can use this field to create an adjustment note for a paid or closed transaction.  

- **Adjustment Reference No**: The number of the adjustment note. For **Sales & Receivables**, the number assigned to the posted document populates automatically in this field.  

- **Adjustment Note Date**: Automatically populated from the document date.  

- **Adjustment** and **BAS Adjustment**: These entries populate automatically. Some credit memos are Business Activity Statement (BAS) adjustments. Adjustment notes can only be applied against a single document.

# Special data output and reports for the Icelandic tax authority

It's a legal requirement to send the tax authority a data file in a predefined format.  

To generate the data file for the tax authorities, every account in the chart of accounts must be set up with the correct Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax number as defined by the tax authority.  

General ledger accounts are mapped to predefined government account codes and these codes are divided into groups and types. You need to add the relevant IRS numbers and then manually map general ledger accounts to these codes. You must also report the data to the tax authorities.

# Print VAT summary information on documents in the Icelandic version

If VAT is calculated, VAT summary information is typically printed on sales and purchase documents. However, in Iceland, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't print VAT summary information if only one VAT sales code is used in the document. You can modify this behavior by using the **Always Show VAT Summary** option.  

The following procedure describes how to display VAT summary information on a sales invoice document. The same steps also apply to sales order confirmations, sales quotes, sales credit memos, blanket sales orders, purchase orders, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.  

## Show VAT summary information  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the list, select the relevant document, and then choose the **Print** action.  
1. To display VAT information in the report, select the **Always Show VAT Summary** check box.

# Electronic invoicing requirement - Issuing single-copy invoice

In Iceland, you must send a report to the government if an invoice is printed more than once. This report includes legal text, which confirms that the invoice originates from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that complies with legislation.  

Using this feature, you can send a legal statement with terms and limitations for using single-copy invoices to the tax authorities. The **Printing** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page contains a legal statement (terms and limitations for using single-copy invoices) and also provides an **Electronic Invoicing** check box, which you can select as a reminder that you need to print a statement for the tax authority. You can then print the **IRS Notification** report from the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. On the **Home** tab, in the **Report** group, choose **Print Statement**.  

On the standard posted invoices (invoice and credit memo), legal text is inserted stating that the invoices originate from an ERP solution that complies with Regulation No. 598/1999.

    > This process includes data migration. Therefore, after you enable the Iceland core app, you can't turn it on again.

1. Select **Next**.
1. Select the **I accept the data update** field to confirm that you understand the update procedure and agree to proceed. We highly recommend that you select the **Review Affected Data** link to review the affected data.
1. Select **Finish**.

# Delete posted invoices and credit memos in the Icelandic version

## Before v24.0

In Iceland, in accordance with legislation, you can't delete sales and purchase invoices and credit memos after they're posted. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the **Delete** command isn't available for these types of posted documents. 

## After v24.0

If you activate the new [Icelandic localization based on W1 Base App](iceland-global-core-app.md), you can delete sales, purchase invoices, and credit memos, but only in cases where they're older than seven years at the beginning of the new fiscal year.

> [!NOTE]
> The deletion is technically controlled with the new ENUM field **Document Retention Period** in the **General Ledger Setup** page. This field is hidden and has the **IS Docs Retention Period** option by default enabling this control.

Delivery reminders are used to track overdue vendor shipments and to remind vendors about overdue deliveries. To create delivery reminders, you must set up the following items:

- **Delivery reminder terms**  

    Delivery reminder terms are identified by a code that must be assigned to vendors. To use more than one combination of settings, you must set up a code for each setting separately. You can set up any number of delivery reminder terms.  

- **Delivery reminder levels**  

    For every delivery reminder term, you must set up delivery reminder levels. These levels determine how often delivery reminders can be created for a specific term. Level 1 is the first delivery reminder that you create for an overdue delivery. Level 2 is the second delivery reminder, and so on. When delivery reminders are created, the number of reminders that were created previously is considered, and the current number is used to apply terms.  

- **Delivery reminder texts messages**  

    You must set up delivery reminder text messages for every delivery reminder level. There are two types of delivery reminder text messages: beginning and ending. The beginning text message is printed under the header section, before the list of entries that are marked for reminder. The ending text message is printed after this list.  

After you set up the delivery terms, levels, and texts, you must assign the relevant delivery reminder codes to your vendors.  

You can create delivery reminders manually or automatically. You can use the **Create Delivery Reminder** batch job to create delivery reminders automatically so that you can select the purchase orders for which delivery reminders must be created.  

You can also track documents in relation to purchase order lines and sales order lines.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides the following reports:  

- **Issued Delivery Reminder** - To view the delivery reminders for vendors.  
- **Delivery Reminder - Test** - To verify the delivery reminders before you issue them.

## Set up Electronic Funds Transfer

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] can export EFT files that you can then upload to your bank's website for additional processing. To submit EFT files, you must set up the following information:  

- You must add EFT information to the bank account or bank accounts that you use to pay vendors electronically. The EFT-specific fields are on the **Bank Account** page.  
- For those vendors that you want to pay electronically, you must select the **EFT Payment** checkbox and specify the vendor bank account in the **EFT Vendor Bank Account Code** field on the **Vendor** page.  

After setting up bank accounts and vendors, you can create EFT files that are based on entries in the payment journal. When you create an EFT file, an entry is made in the **EFT Register** table. On the **EFT Register** page, you can drill down to see the vendor ledger entries for the EFT file. On the **Payment Journal** page, you can also import existing EFT register entries to the payment journal by using the **Transfer EFT Register** batch job.

> [!NOTE]  
> Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) uses posted and nonposted payments as the basis to calculate withholding tax amounts for applied invoices. Payments that aren't applied to an invoice can only be exported to an EFT file if the **Skip WHT** checkbox is selected. During export of the EFT file, the payment journal lines aren't deleted and can't be deleted as long as they have a reference to an EFT register. To remove the link between the EFT register and payment journal lines, choose the **Cancel Export** action either on the **EFT Register** page or the **Payment Journal** page.

When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a non-cash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.

## Calculate GST on prepayments  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Local Functionalities** FastTab, select the **Full GST on Prepayment** checkbox to calculate GST for the total invoice amount when a prepayment invoice is posted.

You can use customized posting groups to automate recurring transactions in journals, sales documents, or purchase documents. These posting groups can be used throughout [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] to trigger automatic postings and allocations across different accounts or dimensions.

Automatic account codes can be used to automate postings related to payroll overhead. For example, when posting total salary expenses at the end of the month, you can use automatic account codes to assign a percentage of the total salary to automatically post as overhead expenses.  

You can also use automatic account codes to trigger cost or revenue allocations across different dimensions. For example, you can set up an automatic account group to divide total expenses across three departments when posting an invoice.

You can use the **General Ledger Setup** page to set up unrealized sales tax. You can also set up maximum correction tax amounts so that you can limit the tax correction amounts that are entered for sales and purchases. This allows you to overwrite the calculated tax. It's useful when there are rounding differences between what is calculated on the purchase order, and what is calculated on the purchase invoice from the vendor.

> [!NOTE]
> If you work with excise tax, the system doesn't allow you to change the **Tax Amount** field on the **Statistics** page for an invoice, for example to adjust for rounding. Therefore, if you set up an excise tax with more than two decimals and you experience a rounding difference compared to your vendor's invoices, then you must handle the rounding difference by posting an extra G/L entry. This way, the total matches the document amount. This posting could be made to an expense account dedicated to amount rounding.

## Set up unrealized sales tax  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.

> [!NOTE]
> New capabilities for creating bank deposits are available in Business Central 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you used Business Central in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features right away, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](../../../bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

You can make bank deposits to maintain a transaction record that contains information that can be applied to outstanding invoices and credit memos.  

The **Deposits** page specifies bank deposit information such as the bank account number, total deposit amount, deposit lines, posting date, document date, department code, currency code, and bank deposit notes. You can use the page to create new bank deposits, post deposits, print deposits, view deposit comments, or view a report that shows the deposit amount to reconcile.

The **Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

Bank deposit lines contain information about the individual deposited items, such as checks from customers. This information includes the document date and number, account type and number, and amount. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it in order to update the relevant ledgers, such as the bank ledger, general ledger, or customer ledger. Posted deposits are stored for future reference and can be viewed on the **Posted Deposits** page.

Sales tax includes taxes that companies pay for using items:

- **Use tax (United States)** – Use tax is a United States sales tax that is paid on items that are purchased by a company and are used by that company instead of being sold to a customer. The company must pay sales tax for those items to the government, in the form of use tax.  
- **Purchase tax (Canada)** – Purchase tax is a Canadian sales tax that is paid by a company on items that are purchased from a vendor. When a company purchases items for use by the company itself, the vendor charges the appropriate sales tax for the items.

When you first start using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can run an assisted setup guide to quickly and easily set up sales tax information for your company, customers, and vendors. 

In a matter of minutes, you're ready to create sales documents and purchase documents with sales tax calculated correctly. Just search for the **Set Up Sales Tax** assisted setup guide and then follow the steps in the guide. This includes specifying the accounts that you want to use for sales tax for sales and purchases.  

We recommend that you choose to apply the new tax area to your own company information. If you also choose to apply it to customers or vendors, you'll be asked if you want to set a filter. This filter determines which customers or vendors you want to apply the information to. For example, you can choose to apply the tax area to those customers that are in your own city or county, or to all customers.

Who you assign the tax area codes to will determine the taxes that are calculated on your sales and purchasing transactions.

If you move to the empty *My Company*, we recommend that you start by using each of the assisted setup guides, including the one for sales tax. If you prefer to set up sales tax yourself, this article explains what you have to take into consideration. But we recommend that you work closely with your tax advisor.  

## Tax groups, tax areas, and tax jurisdictions

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)], a tax group represents a group of inventory items or resources that are subject to identical tax terms. For example, you can set up a tax group for taxable items and another for nontaxable items. You must assign tax group codes to inventory items and general ledger accounts. Similarly, you must assign tax area codes to customers, locations, and to your own company settings. The assisted setup guide helps you do this.  

Each tax area is a grouping of sales tax jurisdictions based on a particular geographic location. For example, the tax area for Miami, Florida, includes three sales tax jurisdictions: city (Miami), county (Dade), and state (Florida). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes a limited set of tax areas with a default configuration, but you can change them and add new tax areas.

> Businesses in all countries/regions can benefit from the ability to review general ledger entries before posting them. In a future release, we'll deprecate the country/region specific feature and replace it with one that's available in all country/region versions. After the feature is deprecated, you can use it to access previous reviews, but not to do new reviews. We'll archive your data according to local requirements. To learn more about the deprecation, go to [Deprecated Features in the Base App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). To learn about the replacement feature, go to [Review Amounts in General Ledger Accounts](../../../finance-review-accounts.md).

By applying temporary general ledger entries, companies can work with temporary and transfer accounts in the general ledger. Temporary and transfer accounts are used to store temporary ledger entries that are waiting for further processing into the general ledger.  

You can use temporary accounts for:  

- Money transfers from one bank account to another.  
- Financial transaction transfers from one system to another in which part of the information temporarily resides on the original system.  
- Transactions for which you have issued a sales invoice to a customer but have not yet received the corresponding purchase invoice from the vendor.  

When the ledger entries have been processed, you can use the **Apply Entries** function to update the posted ledger entries and the posting account type.  

You can unapply the applied general ledger entries and then open the closed entries to make changes.  

## To apply general ledger entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a general ledger register, and then choose the **General Ledger** action.  
3. On the **General Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Apply Entries** action.  

    All open ledger entries for the general ledger account are displayed on the **Apply General Ledger Entries** page.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > By default, the **Include Entries** field is set to **Open**. You can change the value of the **Include Entries** field to **All** or **Closed**. You can only apply general ledger entries that are **Open**.  

4. Select the relevant general ledger entry, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  

    The **Applies-to ID** field is updated with the user ID. The remaining amount is displayed in the **Balance** field on the **Apply General Ledger Entries** page.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > You can apply multiple entries only if all entries that are being applied can be fully closed.  

5. Choose the **Post Application** action.  

    You can post the application even if the balance amount is equal to 0. When posted, the **Remaining Amount** field is affected as follows:  

    - If the **Balance** is equal to 0, then the **Remaining Amount** field on all ledger entries is set to 0.  

    - If the **Balance** is not equal to 0, then the amount in the **Balance** field is transferred to the **Remaining Amount** field for the general ledger entry that was selected when you posted the application.  

    - For all other general ledger entries, the **Remaining Amount** field is set to 0 and the **Open**, **Closed by Entry No.**, **Closed by Amount**, and **Closed at Date** fields are updated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When posted, the general ledger entries which update the **Applies-to ID** field are deleted.  

6. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To view the applied general ledger entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a general ledger register, and then choose the **General Ledger** action.  
3. Select the relevant general ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action.  

    You can view all the applied general ledger entries.  

4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To unapply general ledger entries  

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **G/L Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a general ledger register, and then choose the **General Ledger** action.  
3. Select the general ledger entry that you want to unapply, and then choose the **Undo Application** action.  

    The applied general ledger entries are unapplied.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If an entry is applied to more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first. By default, the latest entry is displayed.  

4. Choose the **OK** button.

# Set Up Payment Classes

To use payment management in the French version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up payment classes to define operation types, such as bills of exchange, electronic payments, or checks. Payment classes are defined in the **Payment Slip Setup** page.  

For each operation type, you then define the various statuses that the operation type can have, and you associate each status with steps to define how the payment changes from one status to the another.  

## To set up a payment class  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2. On the **Payment Slip Setup** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Enable**|Select to enable usage of the payment class.|  
    |**Code**|The unique identification code for the payment class.|  
    |**Name**|The payment class description.|  
    |**Header No. Series**|The number series code for the payment slip header.|  
    |**Line No. Series**|The number series code for the payment slip lines. If you leave this field blank, the number for each payment line is created based on the payment header number.|  
    |**Suggestions**|The type of payment proposals that can be created automatically on a payment slip.|  
    |**Unrealized VAT Reversal**|Specify the method to handle unrealized VAT.<br /><br /> If you select **Application**, VAT will be realized when you post the invoice application and payment application.<br /><br /> If you select **Delayed**, you must define the payment step during which VAT must be realized, by selecting the **Realize VAT** field on the **Payment Step Card** page.|  
    |**SEPA Transfer Type**|Specify the SEPA export format, either **Credit Transfer** or **Direct Debit**. You specify the export format for SEPA transfers in payment steps for the payment class.|  

## To set up payment statuses for a payment class  

1. In the **Payment Slip Setup** page, select a payment class, and then choose the **Status** action.  
2. On the **Payment Status** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    For example, the **RIB** field indicates that information about the Relevé d'Identité Bancaire (RIB) statement for the customer or vendor must be displayed in the payment lines. The RIB information includes the bank branch number, agency code, bank account number, bank name, RIB key, and key verification.

4. When you have defined the statuses you want for this payment class, return to the **Payment Slip Setup** page.  

Next, you must define steps for each payment class. The payment steps define how the payment moves from one state to the next, such as *Creation of documents*, *Documents created*, and *Creation of payments*.  

## To set up payment steps for a payment class

1. In the **Payment Slip Setup** page, select a payment class, and then choose the **Steps** action.  
2. In the **Payment Step** list, add the relevant steps for this payment class. For each step, you can enter a maximum of 50 alphanumeric characters.  
3. Choose the first step, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Payment Step Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Previous Status** field defines the previous status, from which the step was last executed. The default value is 0, and the first step will have 0 as the value of the **Previous Status** field.
>
> To make a step optional and potentially repeatable, set the  previous status to be equal to the next status.
>
> The **Action Type**, **Export Type**, and **Export No.** fields play together. For example, for SEPA credit transfer files, set **Export Type** to **XMLport**, and then set the **Export No.** field to 1000. For SEPA direct debit files, specify **XMLport**, and then set the **Export No.** field to 1010.

If the action type of the payment step is **Ledger**, you must set up extra ledger information for the payment step.  

### To set up ledger information for a payment step  

1. On the **Payment Step Card** page for the payment step, choose the **Ledger** action.  
2. On the **Payment Step Ledger** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as appropriate. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# View Ledger Reconciliations
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes two reports that can help you reconcile general ledger entries with customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. The reports print a separate page for each customer or vendor that sums up amounts from general ledger transactions based on payments and posted invoices.  

The following procedure applies to viewing reconciliation between the general ledger and the customer ledger, but the same steps apply to reconciliation with the vendor ledger.  

## To view general ledger reconciliation with the customer ledger  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger**, and then choose the related link in **General Ledger**.  
2.  Choose the **Reports** action, choose the **France** action, and then choose the **GL/Cust. Ledger Reconciliation** action.  
3.  On the **GL/Cust. Ledger Reconciliation** page, set the appropriate filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You must specify a date filter.  

4.  Choose the **Preview** button.  

You can now view the debit and credit amounts for each customer, and you can see the document numbers that resulted in each general ledger transaction.

# Requirements for Reporting Declaration of Trade in Goods in the French Version

In this article, we describe how you can set up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for reporting the Declaration of Trade in Goods (DEB) report in France.  

The following fields are required for reporting DEB:  

- **CISD** from the **Company Information** table.  
- **Registration No.** from the **Company Information** table.  
- **VAT Registration No.** from the **Company Information** table.  
- **Name** from the **Company Information** table.  
- **Date** for the statistics period from the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** table.  
- **Transaction Specification** from the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** table.  
- **Quantity** from the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** table must be greater than 0.  
- **Statistical Value** from the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** table must be greater than 0.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Export DEB DTI** report exports shipments and receipts in one batch. If you want to report only shipments or receipts, then you must set a filter to remove the lines that are not needed in the **Intrastat Journal** table.  

## Intrastat requirements for DEB

For France, Intrastat management implies to separate the declaration data for the statistical reporting and for the fiscal reporting (recapitulative statement of VAT). It is required that Intrastat exports separetely files based on configured obligation level.

1. To export Intrastat lines correctly, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals** and then select the action **Suggest Lines**. New Intrastat journal lines will be created for the selected period.  

2. On the journal lines, fill in the necessary fields, and then choose the **Export DEB DTI+** action.  

    The **Export DEB DTI** runs. You must specify the obligation level that you want to report. The **Transaction Specification Filter** field on the request page has a predefined value that depends on the specified obligation level. The value of this field is a filter that is applied to the **Transaction Specification** field of the Intrastat journal lines.  

When the report is run, only Intrastat journal lines with a value of the **Transaction Specification** field that matches the **Transaction Specification Filter** field are processed. The field **Transaction Specification Filter** is editable, so you can change its value according to your needs. The following table outlines the currently supported values:

| Level | Filter |
|--|--|
| **Obligation Level 1** | `11 | 19 | 21 | 29` |
| **Obligation Level 2** | “” (a blank filter, so that all Intrastat journal lines are processed) |
| **Obligation Level 3** | “” |
| **Obligation Level 4** | `<>29&<>11&<>19` (lines with Transaction Specification 29, 11, 19 are not processed) |
| **Obligation Level 5** | `<>11&<>19` |

## Validate Intrastat lines

Run the **Advanced Intrastat Checklist** report to check Intrastat journal lines before they are exported to XML. The check is run inside the **Export DEB DTI** report.  

### To enable the check

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup** and then choose the relevant link.  
2. Select the **Use Advanced Checklist** field.  
3. Choose the **Advanced Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
4. Add the necessary lines with the **Object Type** field set to *Report*, and the **Object Id** field set to *10821*. Then set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a non-empty value. Fill in the **Filter Expression** field if needed.

# Accelerated Depreciation in the French Version

Accelerated depreciation is calculated based on the differences between the accounting depreciation book and the tax depreciation book fixed asset, during the life of the fixed asset.  

Fixed assets that have higher tax depreciation and lower accounting depreciation are depreciated using the accelerated depreciation method, as allowed by the tax authorities.  

Companies must use the accelerated depreciation method to post the extra tax amounts if they meet at least two of the following criteria:  

- They have more than 50 employees.  
- They have at least two million euros in assets.  
- They have at least four million euros in sales.  

## Depreciation Book  
The accelerated depreciation method helps you to calculate and post differences between tax depreciation amounts and accounting depreciation amounts that are allowed for fixed assets. To calculate accelerated depreciation for fixed assets, the following depreciation books must be set up:  

- The accounting depreciation book (integrated with the general ledger).  
- The tax depreciation book (not integrated with the general ledger).  

You must set up the tax book as a derogatory book by using an accelerated depreciation setup parameter. If this parameter is set, differences between the tax book and the accounting book are calculated and posted as accelerated depreciation amounts. For more information, see [Set Up Accelerated Depreciation](how-to-set-up-accelerated-depreciation.md).  

### Example  
 If you have a fixed asset valued at 1,000 euros that is depreciated in the accounting depreciation book over five years, and depreciated in the tax depreciation book over three years, then the accounting depreciation for the first year is 200 euros (1,000/5) and the tax depreciation for the first year is 333.33 euros (1,000/3). The accelerated depreciation amount is the difference between these two amounts: 133.33 euros (333.33 - 200).  

## Accelerated Depreciation Accounts  
Accelerated depreciation uses the derogatory fixed asset posting type. Statistics and reports use this posting type to report the accelerated depreciation calculation. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](../../fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).  

There are two accounts to set up for derogatory amounts:  

- Positive accelerated depreciation amounts (increase of accelerated depreciation):  

  - Derogatory account  
  - Derogatory expense account  
  - Negative accelerated depreciation amounts (decrease of accelerated depreciation):  
  - Derogatory Acc. on Disposal  
  - Derog. Bal. Acc. on Disposal  

If you post an acquisition, depreciation, or disposal for the accounting depreciation book, the transaction is automatically duplicated and posted in the tax depreciation book when the journal is posted.  

After you set up the tax depreciation book and the accounting depreciation book, the accelerated depreciation is calculated automatically for fixed assets using the calculate depreciation batch job in the accounting depreciation book. For more information, see [Calculate Accelerated Depreciation](how-to-calculate-accelerated-depreciation.md).

# Set Up Accelerated Depreciation

To use the accelerated depreciation calculation, you must set up the following depreciation books for fixed assets:  

- The accounting depreciation book (integrated with the general ledger).  
- The tax depreciation book (not integrated with the general ledger).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you post an acquisition, depreciation, or disposal for the accounting depreciation book, the transaction is duplicated and posted in the tax depreciation book when the fixed asset journal is posted.  

The difference between the accounting depreciation book and the tax depreciation book is managed through the settings on the **Integration** FastTab on the deprecation book card as indicated in the following table.  

|Depreciation book purpose  |Value of the Derogatory field  |
|---------|---------|
|Accounting depreciation  | Switched on       |
|Tax depreciation     | Switched off |

The **Derogatory** field specifies if you want derogatory entries that are posted to this depreciation book to be posted both to the general ledger and the FA ledger. If you have placed a check mark in the field, you must use the FA G/L journal to post derogatory entries.

You specify the G/L accounts that must be used in the **FA Posting Group** page. In the **Depreciation Book** page, you specify the posting group that must be used.

If you do not place a check mark in the field, you must use the FA journal to post derogatory entries, which will be posted only to the FA Ledger Entry table.

For the tax depreciation book, on the **General** FastTab, you then specify the relevant accounting depreciation book in the **Derogatory Calculation** that will calculate derogatory depreciation. The **Used with Derogatory Book** field in the accounting depreciation book is updated with the tax depreciation book code.  

## Derogatory calculation

The **Derogatory Calculation** field on a depreciation book specifies if this book is used as tax depreciation book to calculate derogatory depreciation. The specified code for the accounting depreciation book establishes a derogatory setup.

As for the tax book, only FA entries will be posted, the check boxes on the **Integration** tab cannot be checked.

When the field is blank, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will use the depreciation book in a standard way. If it is not blank, the system will calculate derogatory depreciation.

# Export General Ledger Entries for Tax Audits in the French Version
In France, companies must provide corporate tax and VAT information, such as transactions and general ledger postings, for audits in a file format that is specified by tax authorities. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], this information is recorded in a standard audit file that is designed to provide information about account types that include posted entries.

You can include opening balances in the file, but these are not actual posted entries. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] calculates opening balance by using account entries up to the starting date that you specify for the file. The calculation also includes the closing entries that are generated by closing the prior year. The opening balances are mapped to the required fields in the report.  

If you do not close your fiscal year or do not run the **Close Year** action before generating the report, the file will include balances from income statement accounts.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Opening balances are included in the report only for accounts with balances that are not equal to zero. To identify opening balances, look for the following values in the following fields:  
>   
>  -  JournalCode = 0  
> -   JournalLib = BALANCE OUVERTURE  
> -   EcritureNum = 0  
> -   EcritureLib = Accounts prefixed with BAL OUV  
> -   ValidDate = Start date specified on the report's request page  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before exporting general ledger entries, make sure you have marked G/L Accounts to be detailed when exporting opening balances. This is usually a requirement for bank, customer and vendor G/L Accounts. This is done by enabling the checkbox in the field **Detailed Balance** on th **G/L Account Card** page.
>   

## To export general ledger entries to a text file for a tax audit  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export G/L Entries – Tax Audit**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  On the **Export G/L Entries – Tax Audit** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|Enter the date to use as the starting date for the time period to be covered by the audit.|  
    |**Ending Date**|Enter the date to use as the ending date for the time period to be covered by the audit.|  
    |**Include Opening Balances**|Select if you want to include opening balances in the audit report file. The balances are calculated as of the date before the first date of the period covered by the report.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button to export the file.  

When you create the report, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] sorts the information in the report by the **No.** and **Creation Date** fields in the general ledger register.  

The report will have the following name: `<taxpayername>FEC<YYYYMMDD>`

# Close Years in the French Version
When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that it comprises.  

## To close a year  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Choose the **Close Year** action.  

    If more than one fiscal year is open, the earliest one should be closed. A message appears to identify the year that should be closed and explains the consequences of closing it.  

3.  To close the year, choose the **Yes** button.  

When the fiscal year is closed, the **Closed** and **Date Locked** fields are selected for all the periods in the year. At this point the fiscal year cannot be opened again, and you cannot clear the **Closed** or **Date Locked** fields.  

> [!WARNING]  
> You cannot close a fiscal year before you create a new one. When a fiscal year has been closed, you cannot change the starting date of the following fiscal year.  

Even though a fiscal year has been closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it until you fiscally close the fiscal year. When you do this, the entries will be marked as posted to a closed fiscal year, and the Prior-Year Entry field will be selected. For more information, see [Fiscally Close Years](how-to-fiscally-close-years.md).  

After a fiscal year is closed, you must close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. You can repeat this each time you post to the closed fiscal year.  

After a fiscal year is fiscally closed, it cannot be opened again, and general ledger entries cannot be posted.

# Year End Processes Overview in the French Version

Year end closing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] involves three steps:  

1. Closing the fiscal year. For more information, see [Fiscally Close Accounting Periods](how-to-fiscally-close-accounting-periods.md).  
2. Generating a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** option along with the offsetting equity account entries. For more information, see [Posting the year-end closing entry](how-to-post-the-year-end-closing-entry.md).  
3. Fiscally closing the fiscal year. For more information, see [Fiscally Close Years](how-to-fiscally-close-years.md).  

According to the French law *NF Logiciel compatibilité informatisée* the system has to refuse the creation of a third open fiscal year, so only two open fiscal years are allowed at the same time.  

So in time you are required to close a year. You also do not have to worry about losing details of transactions when you close because all details are retained, even after you (fiscally) close the year.  

When you close at the end of the year, the system moves your earnings from calculated earnings, or the Current Earnings account, to a posted account, or the Retained Earnings account. The system also marks the fiscal year as "closed," and marks all subsequent entries for the closed year as "prior year entries."  

The system then generates a closing entry, but it does not post the entry automatically. You are given the opportunity to make the offsetting equity account entry or entries, which allows you to decide how to allocate your closing entry. For example, if your company has several divisions, you can let the system generate a single closing entry for all the divisions, and you can then make an offsetting entry for each division's equity account.  

Once a year has been fiscally closed you will not be able to post in this fiscal year.

# Deliver sales invoices with French specifics

This article explains how to set up and work with sales invoice information that is specific to France.

## Create a new customer

When you create a new customer in France, some specific information must be included. To create the **Customer** card correctly, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, enter a value in the **SIREN No.** field. This number is required to print sales invoices.

If the new **Customer** card is created from an existing **Contact** card, the value in the **SIREN No.** field is copied from the contact.

## Work with the sales documents

When you create a new sales document, you can select whether to print value-added tax (VAT) that has been paid on debts. To print this information, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, enable the **VAT Paid on Debts** field.

When you print sales documents, [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../../includes/prod_long.md)] automatically indicates, in the comment, whether a sales invoice includes only goods, only services, or both goods and services. This determination is based on the value of the **Type** field on the **Item** card (**Inventory** or **Service**), the resources that are used, or the general ledger account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an alternative address in the sales invoice, [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../../includes/prod_long.md)] automatically shows this address in the comment of the printed report.

You can find training information about sales invoices on [Microsoft Learn](/learn/modules/process-intrastat-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

# Export General Ledger entries for tax audits

In France, companies must provide corporate tax and VAT information, such as transactions and general ledger postings, for audits. The information must be provided in a file format that's specified by tax authorities. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], this information is recorded in a standard audit file that is designed to provide information about account types that include posted entries.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a new feature in release 22.1. To use this feature, run the **Audit File Export Document** page. 

## Export the audit file

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Audit File Export Document**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create new exporting process. 
3. In the **Audit File Export Format** field, select **FEC** to specifiy the format that's used to export the audit file.  
4. On the **FEC** FastTab, mark the **Include Opening Balances** field to include opening balances in the audit report file. The balances are calculated as of the date before the first date of the period covered by the report. 
5. Enter the **Default Source Code** to specify the source code to be used if there is no code specified in the G/L entry. 
6. Enter information in the remaining fields as described in the article, [How to export Audit Files](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).

## Numbering in the "EcritureNum" tag

The numbering in the "EcritureNum" tag must increase over time and not contain any breaks. This transaction numbering must be unique for the whole file or specific to each journal code. Using the **No.** field in the **G/L Regusters** provides unique numbering. However, if you post multiple invoices through one journal, all of the invoices will have one common **No.**. French regulation requires a unique number for each invoice.  

To fufill this requirment, run the report with an additional option. To do this, follow next steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Export G/L Entries - Tax Audit**.
2. Select the **Use Transaction No.** field. When you select this field, the transaction number is used as the progressive number in audit file. If you don't select this field, the general ledger register number is used as the progressive number.
3. Select **OK** to create the report.

# Post the Year-End Closing Entry in the French Version

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

## To post the year-end closing entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Review the entries.  
3. Choose the **Post** action.  
4. In the posting confirmation page, choose the **Yes** button.  

If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the system removes the posted entries from the journal.  

Once posted, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Export General Ledger Entries to an XML File
You can export financial transactions for a particular period to an XML file for external archiving. After the closing of the fiscal year, you can export the general ledger transactions for the closed year by applying the correct date filter and then exporting the financial transactions within the specified period to the XML file. The XML file includes all the general ledger transaction information, such as document posting date, document type, document number, account type, account number, credit amount, and debit amount retrieved from the **General Journal** page.  

## To export general ledger entries to an XML file  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export G/L Entries to XML**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  On the **Export G/L Entries to XML** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|Sets the starting date to export the financial transactions.|  
    |**Ending Date**|Sets the ending date to export the financial transactions.|  

3.  To export the file, choose the **OK** button.  

You can save the generated file to a specified location, or you can open the file.  

> [!WARNING]  
>  If you have set the start date and end date to include the entire fiscal year, the process can take several minutes.

# Apply General Ledger Entries in the French Version

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses in all countries/regions can benefit from the ability to review general ledger entries before posting them. In a future release, we'll deprecate the country/region specific feature and replace it with one that's available in all country/region versions. After the feature is deprecated, you can use it to access previous reviews, but not to do new reviews. We'll archive your data according to local requirements. To learn more about the deprecation, go to [Deprecated Features in the Base App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). To learn about the replacement feature, go to [Review Amounts in General Ledger Accounts](../../finance-review-accounts.md).

You apply general ledger entries to justify ledger balances on asset and liability accounts. For example, you can apply transactions on the bill of exchange accounts to get a clear picture of which bills make up the balance of the account.  

## To apply general ledger entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the account that you want to apply entries for, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.  
3. On the **Apply G/L Entries** page, select the ledger entries that you want to apply.  
4. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action to populate the **Applies-to ID** field with the user ID of the current user.  
5. Choose the **Post Application** action.  

This effectuates the application by setting the **Letter** and **Letter Date** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Applied entries can be identified by having the same three-letter combination and the same date.

# Payment Management in the French Version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to manage bills of exchange, electronic payments, and vendor payments using the payment management function.  

You can manage customer and vendor payments using payment slips. Before you create a payment slip, you must set up the following prerequisites:  

- Payment class – The type of payment that you want to perform, for example, bill of exchange, electronic payment, or check. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Classes](how-to-set-up-payment-classes.md).  

- Payment status – The progress level of a payment document. You must define a set of statuses for each payment class. For more information, see [To set up payment statuses for a payment class](how-to-set-up-payment-classes.md#to-set-up-payment-statuses-for-a-payment-class).  

- Payment steps – A payment that is executed at a specified time. After a payment step is completed, you can move the payment document from one status to another. If a step involves posting debit or credit entries, you must define additional actions in the **Payment Step Ledger** table. For more information, see [To set up payment steps for a payment class](how-to-set-up-payment-classes.md#to-set-up-payment-steps-for-a-payment-class).  

- Payment address for vendors and customers – The address that is used for a vendor or a customer at the time of settlement. The payment address can be different from the vendor's or customer's default address. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Addresses](how-to-set-up-payment-addresses.md).  

You can also transfer your payment management setup information to an external disk so that you can use the same parameters for another company with similar requirements.  

## Managing Payment Slips and Files

You can create payment slips to manage customer payments and vendor payments. After creating the payment slip, you must post it.  

These payment slips can then be converted into payment files, which can be sent to the bank electronically.  

For more information, see [Create Payment Slips](how-to-create-payment-slips.md).  

## Archiving Payment Slips

You can separate a fully processed payment slip from the active payment slips by archiving it. You can manually archive an individual payment slip or you can automatically archive a batch of payment slips. For more information, see [Archive Payment Slips](how-to-archive-payment-slips.md).

# Fiscally Close Years
When a fiscal year is complete, you must fiscally close the periods that it comprises to make sure that no more general ledger entries can be posted.  

Before fiscal closing is allowed the following must be done:  

- The fiscal year has been closed first. For more information, see [Close Years](how-to-close-years.md).  
- All journal lines that are not posted for the year are either posted or deleted before the year is fiscally closed.
- All closing entries are up-to-date.  

## To fiscally close years  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Choose the **Fiscally Close Year** check box.  

    If more than one fiscal year is not fiscally closed, the earliest one should be fiscally closed. A message appears that identifies the year that should be closed and explains the consequences of closing it.  

3.  To fiscally close the year, choose the **Yes** button.  

When the fiscal year is fiscally closed, the **Fiscally Closed** field for all the periods in the year is selected. The fiscally closed year cannot be opened again, and you cannot clear the **Fiscally Closed** field.

# Calculate Accelerated Depreciation in the French Version
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you calculate periodic depreciation for fixed assets by using the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The fixed asset depreciation book that is linked to the fixed asset defines the depreciation method, the starting date for depreciation, and the fixed asset posting group that is used in the batch job.  

If a fixed asset depreciation book is integrated with the general ledger, then it is called an *accounting depreciation book*. If a fixed asset depreciation book is not integrated with the general ledger, then it is called a *tax depreciation book*.  

You can only calculate the accelerated depreciation for fixed assets that have an accounting depreciation book and a tax depreciation book. For more information about setting up tax depreciation books and accounting depreciation books for fixed assets, see [Set Up Accelerated Depreciation](how-to-set-up-accelerated-depreciation.md).  

Entries are transferred to the fixed asset general journal when you select an accounting depreciation book in the batch job. Entries are transferred to the fixed asset journal when you select the tax depreciation book.  

## To calculate accelerated depreciation  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  On the **Calculate Depreciation** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Depreciation Book**|The unique identification code for the accounting depreciation book.|  
    |**FA Posting Date**|Specify the ending date for the depreciation calculation, if this is the first depreciation entry for the asset. The depreciation starting date that is defined on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is used as the starting date for the depreciation calculation. If you have already depreciated the asset, the fixed asset posting date of the last depreciation entry is used as the starting date for the depreciation calculation.|  
    |**Use Force No. of Days**|Select to use the number of days in the **Force No. of Days** field for the depreciation calculation.|  
    |**Force No. of Days**|The number of days for the depreciation calculation. You can only enter a number in this field if the **Use Force No of Days** check box is selected.|  
    |**Posting Date**|The posting date for the calculated depreciation.<br /><br /> You can leave this field blank if the **Use Same FA + G/L Posting Dates** field in the accounting depreciation book is selected. The posting date is copied to the resulting journal lines.|  
    |**Document No.**|The document number for the fixed asset journal batch. Leave this field blank if you have set up a numbering series for the fixed asset journal batch on the **No. Series** page. For more information, see No. Series.|  
    |**Posting Description**|The posting description for the fixed asset journal entries.|  
    |**Insert Bal. Account**|Select to automatically insert balancing accounts in the resulting journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job only uses balancing accounts that are defined in the FA Posting Group.|  

3.  On the **Fixed Asset** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

The accelerated depreciation for the fixed asset is calculated.

# Fiscal Periods and Fiscal Years in the French Version

A fiscal year is typically divided into 12 monthly fiscal periods. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can have two fiscal years open at the same time. You cannot create a third fiscal year if there are two fiscal years open.  

To close a fiscal year, you must close the accounting periods within that year.  

You can only reopen a closed accounting period if the period falls within an open fiscal year. For more information, see [Close Years](how-to-close-years.md). You cannot reopen a closed fiscal year.  

## Closing Fiscal Periods and Fiscal Years

After a fiscal year is complete, you must close the accounting periods within that fiscal year. This is to ensure that general ledger entries are not posted for that period. For more information, see [Fiscally Close Accounting Periods](how-to-fiscally-close-years.md).  

A fiscal year can be closed if all of the following criteria are met:  

- The posting dates on the **User Setup** page and the **General Ledger Setup** page do not fall within the year that you are closing. For more information, see [Specify Posting Periods](../../finance-how-specify-posting-periods.md) and [Understanding the General Ledger and the COA](../../finance-general-ledger.md).  

- The fiscal year has been closed using the **Close Year** function on the **Accounting Periods** page. For more information, see [Closing Years and Periods](../../year-close-years-periods.md).  

- All the unposted journal lines for the year have been posted or deleted.  

- All closing entries are up to date.  

When you close a fiscal period, the earliest open fiscal period is closed. The **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is updated with the start date for the next open period, if the existing date in this field is not already a later date. If the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is within the closed period, then the value in the **Allow Posting To** field is updated with the end date for the first open fiscal period. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the COA](../../finance-general-ledger.md).  

At the end of the year, you must do the following:  

- Close the fiscal year using the **Close Year** function.  
- Generate a year-end closing entry.  
- Post the year-end closing entry, along with the offset equity account entries.  
- Close the fiscal year using the **Fiscally Close Year** function.

# Tax identification types for Mexico

All customers and vendors must have a federal tax identification number. The identification type used for a customer or vendor depends on whether the customer or vendor is classified as a company or as a person.  

## Available tax identification types

In Mexico, a legal entity, such as a company or a person, is assigned a tax identification number according to two types.  

### Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC)  

This tax identification type can be applied to companies and to people. An RFC number for a company is 12 characters, while an RFC number for a person is 13 characters.  

### Cédula de identification fiscal con clave única de registro de población (CURP)

This tax identification type can only be applied to people. A CURP number is 18 characters.  

When you create a new customer or vendor in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you specify whether the customer or vendor is a company or a person, and then you specify the tax identification type. The tax identification type and the tax identification number are included in any reports that reference tax information about a customer or vendor.

# Set up PAC web services

Before you can send invoices and credit memos electronically, you must specify one or more providers of the electronic stamp that must be included in invoices in Mexico.  

When you send an electronic document, it must receive a digital stamp by an authorized service provider, PAC, before it can be sent to your customer. The communication between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and the PAC is managed through web services, and therefore, you must specify technical information about the web services of the PAC that you intend to use.  

To use web services, you must identify the name of the method on the web service that processes requests for digital stamps. Your PAC can give you this information.  

If your PAC offers the service of canceling signed documents, you must specify two web methods: one web method for requesting the digital stamp, and the other for canceling an already signed document.  

Before you can set up the web services, you must upload two certificates:

* A PAC .pfx file
* A SAT .pfx file

These certificates are used by the communication component and configured in the **General Ledger Setup** page. Learn more in [Set up general ledger information](how-to-set-up-electronic-invoicing.md#set-up-general-ledger-information).  

## Add the certificates

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Certificates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action, specify the relevant certificate, and then, in the **Certificate** page, fill in the fields as appropriate. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Repeat step 2 for the second certificate.  
1. Close the page.  

## Set up a PAC web service  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **PAC Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **PAC Web Services** page, add the relevant web services. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    For each web service, you must specify the relevant certificate. You must also add additional details.  

    1. For the relevant web service, choose the **Related** action, choose the **PAC Web Service** menu item, and then choose the **Details** action.  
    1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

        |Field|Description|
        |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
        |**Environment**|Specify if the web service is for a test environment or a production environment.|
        |**Type**|Specify if the web method is for requesting a digital stamp or for canceling.|
        |**Method Name**|Specify the name of the web method, such as *GeneraTimbre* or *CancelaTimbre*.|
        |**Address**|Specify the URL of the web method.|

        Contact your PAC for this information.  

1. Repeat the steps for any additional PAC that you want to set up.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > SAT has certified more than one PAC in Mexico, and you must obtain the appropriate information for communication with the PAC of your choice.

# Comply with electronic accounting regulations in Mexico

In Mexico, individuals and businesses must do their bookkeeping electronically and forward their monthly results to the Mexican Tax Authorities (SAT) as separate XML files at the end of each month. The XML files must contain the following items:

* The chart of accounts. This file is to be submitted whenever the chart of accounts is modified.  
* The trial balance, including opening balances, movements (debit/credit), and final balances.  
* All journal transactions, including all actual movements, such as purchases, sales, and so on. This file is to be submitted upon request from the authorities.

Learn about the structure of these files (also referred to as Annex 24) on the Secretaria de Gobernación website. The **Export Elect. Accounting** functionality is developed to meet this regulatory requirement.

## Set up data required to export successfully

To export the G/L balance information successfully, you must first set up certain data. Missing data results in a warning message that some mandatory fields are blank, but the export isn't canceled. If in doubt, you can submit the file to the authorities to get more details about the missing values. The fields to fill in before you export the XML files are as follows.

For the files that contain the chart of accounts and the trial balance:

1. For each account, you must specify an account in the **SAT Account Code** field. Only accounts with a SAT account code are included in the files for the chart of accounts and trial balance.
1. Every G/L account that is used for export must be defined as either **Debit** or **Credit**. You can't choose the **Both** option.

For the file that contains journal transactions:

* On the **Customer Bank Account Card**, **Vendor Bank Account Card**, and **Bank Account** pages you must choose a bank in the **Bank Code** field. It is required if the bank account is used in a transaction.
* On the **Customer** and **Vendor** pages, you must choose an account in the **Preferred Bank Account** field. When you set a preferred bank account for a customer or vendor, it is automatically copied to the Recipient Bank Account field whenever you make a payment to a vendor or create a cash receipt from a customer. This default value can be changed on the journal lines before posting.
* The **Fiscal Invoice Number PAC** field on all purchase documents is used to register the UUID of an electronic invoice. You can import electronic invoices (response) when you create a purchase invoice, order, or credit memo. Only the UUID is imported, but this functionality can easily be expanded. After data is imported, it appears on the invoice after posting.
* On the **Payment Method** page, in the **SAT Method of Payment** field you must specify how payment was made.

## Generate the XML files

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Elect. Accounting**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Generate electronic invoices in the Mexican version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], after you post a sales invoice, you must generate an electronic invoice that is sent to the customer. You can also export the electronic invoice as an XML file, which you can save to a specified location.  

The following procedure describes how to generate electronic invoices for sales invoices, but the same steps also apply the following documents:

* Sales credit memos  
* Sales shipments  
* Transfer shipments  
* Service invoices  
* Service credit memos  

## Generate electronic invoices for sales invoices  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the posted invoice.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're canceling the posted document, you must specify a reason for the cancellation in the **CFDI Cancellation Reason** field, and you must specify which document substitutes the canceled document in the **Substitution Document No.** field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose the **Send Electronic Document** action, and then specify if you want to also request a digital stamp for the document.  

    If you choose **Request Stamp**, the posted invoice is digitally signed by your PAC, and you can then send the posted invoice afterwards. If you choose **Request Stamp and Send**, the posted invoice is digitally signed and sent in one step.

    An email is sent to the customer with the electronic invoice attached as an XML file. If you selected the **Send PDF Report** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page, a PDF is included with the XML file.  

    You can view of the status of the electronic invoice on the **Shipping & Billing** FastTab.
1. Optionally, choose the **Export E-Document as XML** action. Select the location where you want to save the electronic invoice as an XML file.  

To verify the electronic invoice activity, on the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, the **Electronic Document Sent** and **No. of E-Document Submissions** fields are updated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[bp_refimplementation](../../includes/bp_refimplementation.md)]  

## Receive payments

Mexican companies must be able to receive payments in accordance with CFDI Withholdings and Payment Information version 2.0. To receive payment in accordance with CFDI version 2.0, no additional settings are necessary because the required data will already be included in the customer invoices. You can't stamp a payment that is applied to an invoice that doesn't have a stamp.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The current version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports receipt of *customer payment information* in accordance with CFDI version 2.0. However, *withholding receipt* is currently not supported in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Stamp the payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Find a payment that you applied to the electronic invoice, and then select this line.
1. Choose the **Send** action, and then specify if you want to also request a digital stamp for the payment.

## Register export (Comercio Exterior Complement)

The Comercio Exterior Complement is an annex to the electronic invoice. It identifies importers and exporters and improves the description of the merchandise that is traded. The Comercio Exterior Complement is a key obligation for taxpayers who export merchandise.

To set up Comercio Exterior Complement, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Electronic Invoice** FastTab, in the **USD Currency Code** field, choose the USD currency you want to use. It can be different than *USD*. For example, it might be *USD-CFDI*.  
1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **SAT Customs Unit** field, choose the unit of measure from the **SAT Custom Units** table for foreign trade operations.

To create Comercio Exterior Complement:

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
1. Create a sales invoice with all details ready for export.
1. In the **CFDI Export Code** field, choose a value related to your type of export. Validation of this field sets values on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, but you can change it. For example, if the **CFDI Export Code** contains **04** as a value. The **Foreign Trade** is also used for **Carta Porte Complement**.
1. If you configure a foreign trade invoice, you must fill in the following fields.

    |Field|Description|  
    |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |**Transit-to Location**|Specifies the customer’s location with their address and postal code.|
    |**SAT International Trade Terms (Incoterms)**|You can specify one of the options from the new Incoterms catalog.|
    |**Exchange Rate USD (reversed value for Currency Factor)**|This value is assigned from the **USD Currency Code** exchange rates. You can change this value if needed.|

1. After posting the document and getting a stamp, you'll get an XML file with the Comercio Exterior Complement.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to create an invoice for foreign trade, the **CFDI Export Code** field must be different from **01** because that value is used for domestic invoices only.

# Set up and generate DIOT reports

As a company in Mexico, you must report VAT from vendor purchases to the Mexican government, to SAT - Servicio de Administración Tributaria. This can be done in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] by generating a file that can be uploaded to SAT. This article describes how to set up the functionality and generate the report. The DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros) report functionality is created as an extension (app) for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] and is preinstalled in the online version. However, it must be installed manually in the on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## What does this extension handle?

The extension provides the following capabilities:

* Setup of the DIOT-related information
* Vendor settings
* Export the DIOT report so it can be uploaded to the authorities

## Setup of the Mexican DIOT extension

You set up the DIOT extension through Assisted Setup, which provides an easy, step-by-step guide for getting started with DIOT in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. If needed, you can run the guide several times until the setup is completed.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Set Up DIOT** action.
1. The first page in the setup guide explains what you are about to set up. Choose the **Next** button.
1. In the in **Default Vendor DIOT Type of Operation** field, choose the default type of operation that you want to be set on vendors in the system.

    Every entry in the report must be assigned a **Type of Operation** value. There are three valid types: **Prof. Services**, **Lease and Rent**, and **Others**. You aren't allowed to report the **Lease and Rent** type of operation for a vendor that isn't local. All vendors are updated with the chosen setting.

1. Choose a value in the **Type of Operation** field, and then choose the **Next** button.
1. Choose the **Open Vendor List** action to select another **Type of Operation** value individually for vendors if you want the setting to be different from what you chose in the previous step.

    A special page opens, which includes the **DIOT Type of Operation** field. Here you must set up DIOT concepts, which is a sort of setup of how VAT entries are collected for the report.
1. Choose the **Open DIOT Concepts** action.

    You'll see a list of predefined DIOT concepts that look like VAT setup. These DIOT concepts must be linked to VAT product posting groups and VAT business posting groups. You may not have to link all of the DIOT concepts. Investigate each DIOT concept and decide how these map to your VAT posting setup.

    Adding a link to a DIOT concept is done by clicking the number in the **VAT Link Count** field. Note, that not all DIOT concepts must be linked. DIOT concepts with **None** in the **Column Type** field exist for legacy reasons and can't be linked. For records where the **VAT Link Count** field isn't filled in, you should investigate if you have VAT entries that fall under this DIOT concept and add the corresponding link. DIOT records where the **VAT Link Count** field is filled in indicate that links are already created or don't have to be created.

1. Choose the **Next** button.
   The setup of DIOT is now finished.
1. Choose the **Finish** button.

> [!NOTE]
> For the DIOT report, the vendor's operation type is used for all operations with that vendor unless you specifically change the value of the **DIOT Type Of Operation** in the document before you post it. The DIOT operation type for the vendor isn't passed on to purchase documents automatically. If you want to use a type other than the one that is specified for the vendor, change the field on the purchase document manually.

## Optional setup for reporting withholding tax with the DIOT extension

The DIOT report exports data including withholding tax amounts for vendor transactions. Calculation of withholding tax is currently not supported in the Mexican version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. To work around this, you can post extra lines to a predefined general ledger account. The DIOT extension supports reporting withholding tax data in the following way:

The **VAT Posting Setup** table has a new field, **DIOT WHT %**. By setting this field to a value other than zero, you indicate that all entries posted with this setup are to be considered as if they were posted with that amount of VAT withheld.

For example, if you have transactions that are supposed to be 10% VAT and 5% withholding tax, use a posting setup where the **VAT %** field contains *10* and the **DIOT WHT %** field contains *5*.  

This field will only affect the DIOT report calculations and not the actual posting of the lines/entries/documents, so you must continue the existing workaround that you may have for calculating withholding tax, regardless of setting up the DIOT Report extension.

### Create an export of DIOT report files

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create DIOT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Create DIOT report** request page, set the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields to represent the period for which you wish to report.
1. Choose the **OK** button.

    You may get an error regarding the **RFC No.** field, which needs to be set up on local vendors. To set this up, fill in the **RFC No.** field on the **Payments** tab on the **Vendor Card** page.

When the report runs without errors, you are prompted to save the file **Diot.txt**, which you can then send to authorities.

# Carta de Porte packing slips and transfer orders in the Mexican version

Mexican companies must be able to print and send Carta de Porte-compliant packing slips and transfer orders electronically as Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) files. As of December 1, 2021, the Waybill (Carta de Porte) complement is mandatory for taxpayers who transport goods and merchandise in the national territory. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports CFDI and Carta de Porte so that you can print packing slips and transfer orders that have the required digital signature. The driver can then show the printed document if they're requested to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carta de Porte** feature in the Mexican Business Central localization is currently at version **3.1** and becomes effective with version 24.4.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The documents must include a digital signature, which requires a connection to a PAC, which is an authorized service provider appointed by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT). Learn more in [Set up PAC web services](how-to-set-up-pac-web-services.md).
>
> Also, as of January 2022, you must update the Carta de Porte catalogs that define the various codes. Microsoft provides a downloadable package at [this location](https://microsoft.com) that you can import using RapidStart Services. Learn more in [Import business data from other finance systems](../../across-import-data-configuration-packages.md). Alternatively, if you only use few codes, you can update the current catalogs manually.

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for Carta de Porte-compliant shipments and transfer orders, you must obtain the appropriate certification, digital stamp, and control numbers from the tax authorities. You must install the certificate on the computer where the CFDI files are generated. Learn more in [Set up electronic invoicing](how-to-set-up-electronic-invoicing.md). The [Servicio de Administracíon Tributaria](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242772) website provides information on SAT certificates and keys.

You also must specify the web services that you use to communicate with the PAC in order to obtain digital stamps. Learn more in [Set up PAC web services](how-to-set-up-pac-web-services.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> SAT has certified more than one PAC in Mexico, and you must obtain the appropriate information to communicate with the PAC of your choice.  

You must add information about STC permissions to your company information. You must also fill in more information about the vehicles that you use to transport items around, if this is something that your company does internally as opposed to using an external party. Finally, you must configure each item card to include the required information about item classification, hazardous material, and packaging type. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online is preconfigured to include the relevant catalogs that SAT provides so that you can fill in the various fields.  

### Add SCT permission to company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, on the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **SCT Permission Type** field, choose the relevant type of motor transport used for the transfer of goods or merchandise by your company. The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes define the types.  
1. In the **SCT Permission No.** field, specify the relevant permission number that is issued by the Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes.  

### Set up locations for Carta de Porte

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Locations** page, choose the location that you want to update, and then, on the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields on the **Electronic Document** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    For example, the **ID Ubicacion** field specifies a six-digit code that is unique for this particular location. Then, when you post a shipment that includes this location, that code is prefixed with *OR* if the location is the starting point for the transport. If the location is the destination point, the code is automatically prefixed with *DE*.
1. Repeat step 2 for any other locations that you want to configure for Carta de Porte.

### Set up vehicles for transportation

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Fixed Assets** page, add or edit the relevant vehicles.  

> [!TIP]
> The relevant fields are on the **Electronic Document** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Configure items

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Items** list page, choose each relevant item, and then, on the **Inventory** FastTab, fill in the following fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

    - **SAT Item Classification**  
    - **SAT Hazardous Material**  
    - **SAT Packaging Type**  

## Create sales documents and generate packing slips and transfer orders with Carta de Porte

When you create a document such as a sales order, you must fill in the fields on the **Electronic Document** FastTab, including information about your insurance company. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

For each line on the document, you must also specify the **Custom Transit Number** field. This field specifies the number of the petition that protects the importation of the goods in the following format:  

- The last two digits of the validation year followed by two spaces  
- Two digits of the customs office followed by two spaces  
- Four digits of the number of the patent followed by two spaces  
- One digit corresponding to the last digit of the current year, except if a consolidated motion is initiated in the immediately preceding year or the original motion for a rectification  
- Six digits of the progressive numbering by customs  

Then, when you post the shipment, the required information is carried forward to the posted sales shipment. You can then send or print the document that now includes the Carta de Porte information.  

> [!TIP]
> The same applies when you create and post a transfer order. Learn more in [Transferring inventory between locations](../../inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

# Electronic invoicing in the Mexican version

Mexican companies must be able to send invoices electronically as Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDI) files. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports CFDI so that you can export sales and service invoices and credit memos as electronic documents that have the required digital signature.

> [!NOTE]
> The tax authority (Servicio de Administración Tributaria) announced a version 4.0 of the online digital tax receipt (comprobante fiscal digital por internet—CFDI) system. After the effective date, you can't issue vouchers in versions other than 4.0. Accordingly, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] updated CFDI feature to align with the new regulations.  

The CFDI file is an XML file that contains:  

- Name of issuing company
- Fiscal address of issuing company
- Tax scheme of the issuing company  
- Federal tax registration number (RFC) of issuing company
- RFC of the receiving company  
- Quantity and description of the goods or services  
- Unit price
- Tax amounts listed by tax type  
- Currency code
- Customs location, which includes the date and number of the customs document, if the transaction is an import.
- Digital stamp of the issuing company, which is assigned by the tax authorities (SAT).
- Digital stamp of an authorized service provider, PAC, that you choose.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You need to submit the electronic invoices to a PAC, which is an authorized service provider appointed by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT). SAT has certified more than one PAC in Mexico, and you must obtain the appropriate information to communicate with the PAC of your choice. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports integration with [Interfactura](https://interfactura.com/), but you can use another PAC of your choice.  

## Get started

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for electronic invoicing, you must obtain the appropriate certification, digital stamp, and control numbers from the tax authorities. You must install the certificate on the computer where you generate the CFDI files. Learn more in [Set up electronic invoicing](how-to-set-up-electronic-invoicing.md). Refer to [Servicio de Administracíon Tributaria](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242772) website, for information about SAT certificates and keys.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Set up Mexican CFDI information** assisted setup guide to map information about your company and how you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to the various fields in the CFDI files.

You must also specify the web services that you use to communicate with the PAC to obtain digital stamps. Learn more in [Set up PAC Web Services](how-to-set-up-pac-web-services.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> SAT has certified more than one PAC in Mexico, and you must obtain the appropriate information to communicate with the PAC of your choice.  

You must also specify information about your company and each of your customers and vendors. Learn more in [Set up electronic invoicing](how-to-set-up-electronic-invoicing.md).  

## Send electronic documents

When you post an invoice or credit memo, you can send it to your customer. But first you must obtain a digital stamp from the PAC. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the PAC through web services to request a stamp, and your company and the PAC digitally sign the document automatically.  

When you send an electronic invoice or credit memo to your customer, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses the email address that you specified on the **Company Information** page. The document is sent to the email address that you specified on the **Customer Card** page for the bill-to customer on the invoice or credit memo. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, you can also choose to include the documents as PDF files in the email that is sent.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The users who send electronic invoices must be able to send mail using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Depending on the configuration in your company, you may have to grant explicit permissions to each relevant user and computer.  

If you also want to print the documents, the documents will include a Quick Response (QR) bar code and other information that identifies the related electronic invoice. This information makes the printed document computer-readable and provides a link between the electronic document and the printed document. To learn about generating electronic invoices, refer to [Generate Electronic Invoices](how-to-generate-electronic-invoices.md).  

## Cancel documents

Sometimes you may have to revert a transaction, such as if you have to change the location of a shipment for some reason. You may also have to send such cancellations as electronic documents.  

When you send a cancellation, you must specify a reason for the cancellation, and which document substitutes the canceled document.  

The following table provides an overview of the options for the **CFDI Cancellation Reason** field as of February 2022:

|Option   |Description  |
|---------|-------------|
|01     |Voucher issued with errors in relation.|
|02     |Voucher issued with unrelated errors.|
|03     |The operation wasn't carried out.|
|04     |Related nominative operation in a global invoice.|

If you choose code *01*, then you must also specify the document that substitutes the canceled document in the **Substitution Document No.** field.  

### Send a posted sales invoice for cancellation

1. Open the posted sales invoice that you want to cancel, and then select **Cancel**.  
1. Select **Cancel Request** and confirm. This action allows you to send the cancellation request to the PAC service and receive a cancellation ID for the document.  
1. After you receive a successful response from PAC service, the status is updated to **Cancel In Progress**. The cancellation ID is then taken from the response and updated in the document. This step updates the **Date/Time Stamped** field.  
1. If the error message appears, the status is updated to **Cancel Error**. The error details are shown in the **Error Code** and **Error Description** fields. This step updates the **Date/Time Stamped** field.  

### Send a request to update the status

The SAT authorities need to process and approve the document that you need to cancel. The information about the status should be requested from the PAC service.  

Use the **Get Response** to check and update the cancellation status from the SAT authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> The possible responses **EnProceso**, **Rechazado**, and **Cancelado** update the **Electronic Document Status** field for the next values respectively: **Cancel In Progress**, **Cancel Error**, or **Canceled**.

### Manually cancel a posted sales invoice

In some cases, when the system can't process the document properly due to incorrect reason codes or classification issues by SAT, you can manually force cancellation. Just select the **Mark as Canceled** action in the menu to cancel a posted sales invoice manually.

### E-Invoice status request batch

The user can schedule a batch job to process a document with **Electronic Document Status** equals **Cancel Error**, and **Cancel In Progress**.  

## Communication component

Technically, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] component for electronic invoicing deploys in a library assembly, Microsoft.Dynamics.NAV.MX.dll, which is included automatically with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The component handles the communication with the PAC web services and also generates the QR codes that are included in the printed documents.  

When you generate an electronic document to request a stamp, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates an XML document and sends it to the PAC for processing. The original XML document contains the same information as the original string field that is shown on the printed document. The original string includes the following information:  

- Document date  
- Document type  
- Payment terms  
- Name, address, and federal registration number of your company  
- Name, address, and federal registration number of the customer  
- Line amounts and quantities  

The PAC returns an XML document that has the original string, but this file also includes a section for the digital stamp. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the XML files for documents that have a digital stamp and learn more about the data that goes into each XML element.

# VAT recalculation

When a customer makes payment in a foreign currency, VAT must be recalculated using the exchange rate at the time of the invoice payment.  

A company creates an invoice in a foreign currency for the purchase of taxable goods and taxable services by a foreign customer. This invoice includes VAT. When the customer makes the payment at a later date, VAT is recalculated based on the original sales amount, and adjusted for the new currency rates.  

The following steps show how to create a report for unrealized VAT amounts:  

1. Set up an option to allow recalculation of VAT upon receipt of payment.  
1. Recalculate VAT upon receipt of payment.  
1. Adjust journal entries for realization of VAT taxes payable to recognize exchange differences.  
1. Create a VAT statement that shows the unrealized VAT amounts.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Electronic invoicing in Germany

This article provides information on how to work with the German localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

Learn more in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md), which provides information about setting up the E-Documents framework.

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the E-Document framework for the German localization supports the XRechnung (UBL) and Peppol BIS 3 formats. The ZUGFeRD format isn't supported yet.

# Export and Print Intrastat Reports

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat funcionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. To learn more about the updated version of Intrastat, go to [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md).

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Print general ledger setup information in the German version

Before you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in the daily business, you can run the **G/L Setup Information** report to display the master data that you set up. For example, you can look over this master data, so that you would have a baseline to compare to, and then verify that you set up posting groups correctly.  

## Procedure to print

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Setup Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Setup Information** field, select the master data area as described in the following table.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**G/L Setup - Company Data - Consolidation**|Displays tables for general ledger setup, company information, and business units.|  
    |**Posting Groups**|Displays customer posting group tables, vendor posting group tables, inventory posting group tables, and bank account posting group tables.|

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# VAT Ledgers

The VAT ledger feature enables you to create and print the following windows:

- VAT Purchase Ledger
- VAT Sales Ledger
- VAT Purchase Ledger Additional Sheet
- VAT Sales Ledger Additional Sheet

## VAT Purchase Ledgers and VAT Sales Ledgers

Before you can create VAT ledgers, you must set up number series and vendor posting groups. You must also set up VAT posting groups to identify how VAT entries must be included in VAT ledgers. Also, for each VAT posting setup, you must specify if entries that use the setup must be included in VAT ledgers, and if the entries are VAT exempt. For more information, see [Set Up VAT Ledgers](How-to-Set-Up-VAT-Ledgers.md).

You can create and store any number of VAT ledgers. For example, you can create the following: 

- Sales ledgers for different groups of customers.
- Additional sales ledgers for amount differences and prepayments.
- Joint sales ledgers for the whole company.

To create a VAT ledger, first you must define a VAT ledger type, and then you must add lines to the VAT purchase ledger or VAT sales ledger by using the **Create VAT Purchase Ledger** and **Create VAT Sales Ledger** batch jobs. When you have added lines to the VAT ledger, you can print it.

For more information, see [Create VAT Ledgers](How-to-Create-VAT-Ledgers.md).

## Marking a VAT Purchase Ledger

The VAT for purchase documents must be reflected in the purchase ledger. Return orders of the customers must be reflected in purchase books.

The following procedure shows how to mark a VAT purchase ledger. 

1. In the **Sales Return Order** window or the **Sales Credit Memo** window, select the **Include in Purch. VAT Ledger** check box.

These marked documents will be reflected in the purchase book or in the sales book. Sales return orders are marked by default.

# Inventory Setup

As part of inventory management, you can set up inventory to: 

- Assign item charges on purchases from foreign countries/regions based on weight or volume
- Use the same column for original and corrective postings

## Item Charge Assignment in Purchase Documents

In Russia, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] can assign item charges on purchases from foreign countries/regions based on weight or volume. For each item, in the **Item Card** window, on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, if the **Gross Weight Mandatory** and **Unit Volume Mandatory** check boxes are selected, you must fill in the **Gross Weight** and **Unit Volume** fields. When you suggest an item charge assignment on a purchase order, you must specify that the distribution principle, weight, and volume are added to the options to choose from. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](../../payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).

## Item Corrections

You can set up inventory to use the same column for original and corrective postings. This is often referred to as *red storno*.

You can use red storno posting to post corrections for the following inventory entries:

- Corrective entries in the item journal
- Reversal of item documents such as item receipts and item shipments
- Posting item revaluation or item reclassification journals
- Periodic adjustments of item costs

For more information, see [Post Red Storno Corrections](How-to-Post-Red-Storno-Corrections.md).

### Adjusting Item Cost

If you select the Enable Red Storno field in the **Inventory Setup** window, then negative deviations are posted according to red storno when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

# Define a financial report extension

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] enables you to define an extension for a financial report line. Extensions are useful if you want to filter the data of your general ledger accounts.

## To define a financial report extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Report**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the financial report for which you want to define an extension.
3. Select **Edit Financial Report**.
4. In the **Row No.** field, select the number of the financial report row for which you want to define an extension.
5. In the **Totaling Type** field, select **Custom**, and then select the table you want to use from the **Extension Source Table** field.

Based on your selections, the financial report information is filtered from the entry tables, and then new amounts are calculated for the specified financial report line.

| Description            | You must enter a brief description of the business transaction. This description will be reflected in all transaction books and statements of transactions. |
| Amount                 | Enter the amount of the transaction with the "+ " sign.      |

# Account for the cost to dispose a fixed asset

The maintenance on disposal feature enables you to account for the amount spent to dispose a fixed asset (FA) as an expense. You can post operations related to spending for the disposal of a fixed asset, so that they're reflected in the FA Write-Off Act forms. 

The expenses of a fixed asset disposal can be posted from general ledger journals, fixed asset journals, and purchase documents. The following procedure shows how to post the expenses for a fixed asset disposal by using the Fixed Asset General Ledger Journal. 

The expenses on a fixed asset disposal can be printed in the FA Write-off Act FA-4 report and the FA Write-off Act FA-4a report.

## To set up a maintenance code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Fixed Asset Setup** window, on the **General** FastTab, enter a maintenance code in the **On Disposal Maintenance Code** field.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## To post expenses on a fixed asset disposal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.

2. In the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

   | Field                | Description                                                  |
   | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Account Type**     | Select **Fixed Asset** as the account type.                  |
   | **Account No.**      | Specifies the number of the fixed asset for disposal for which the expenses are made. |
   | **FA Posting Type**  | Select **Maintenance** as the fixed asset posting type.      |
   | **Maintenance Code** | Specifies the maintenance code that is entered in the **On Disposal Maintenance Code** field of the **Fixed Asset Setup** window. |

3. Choose the **OK** button.

## To print a report with expenses on a fixed asset disposal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Write off Act**, and then choose the related link.

2. In the **FA Write off Act** window, enter the expenses that are posted for the fixed asset.

3. Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen. Choose the **Cancel** button to save the information without printing the report.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the expenses on the disposal of the fixed asset are made in advance, they are displayed on the second page of the report.

After the fixed asset write-off report is posted, it becomes the posted fixed asset write-off report.

# Setting up Tax Difference Calculation

Tax difference calculations must be set up if there is a tax difference for the presentation of fixed asset entries, item cost entries, or finance transactions in bookkeeping and tax accounting for which expenses to write off must be fixed. To set tax difference, choose the **Setup** action, and then choose the **Tax Differences** action.

## Setting Up Posting Groups

In the **Tax Difference Posting Groups** you must determine finance accounts from the set up chart of accounts, where finance transactions with tax differences are accounted for.

If there are journal lines that must be normalized before writing off expenses, those journals cannot be posted without running a periodic job of normalizing.

The following procedure shows how to process a normalization function.

1. In the **Future Expenses Journal** window, choose the **Calculate Depreciation by Norm.** action
2. In the **Calculate FE Depr. With Norm** window, on the **Tax Difference** FastTab, enter the filter for the tax difference.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, enter the accounting period for which the counting is done.
4. Choose the **Print** action to print the report.
5. Post the future expenses journal.

# Work with Financial Reports

Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Financial reports analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with general ledger budget entries. The results display in charts on your **Home** page, for instance the cash flow chart.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] provides a few sample financial reports you can use right away, or you can set up your own rows and columns to specify which figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. You can create as many customized financial statements as you want.

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the financial data in the chart of accounts. So, for example, you could view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries. This requires you to have created budgets. Learn more at [Create Budgets](../../finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Account categories and financial reports

You can use account categories to change the layout of your financial statements. After you set up your account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page, and you choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action, the underlying financial reports for the core financial reports are updated. The next time you run one of these reports, such as the balance statement, new totals and subentries are added, based on your changes.

## To create new financial reports

You use financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with general ledger budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Financial Report** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes//tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.
5. On the **Financial Report** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   When you have created a new financial report and set up the rows, you must set up columns. You can either set them up manually or assign a predefined column layout to your financial report.

6. Choose the **Edit Column Layout Setup** action.
7. On the **Column Layout** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you did not assign a default column layout to the financial report, you must set the columns up manually.

### To create a column that calculates percentages

Sometimes you may want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. So, let's say you have a number of rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales each row represents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a report.
3. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentage will be based.
4. Insert a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.
5. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**, then in the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage will be based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.
6. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.
7. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**; then in the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount that you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percent sign (%). For example, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## To set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement comparing general ledger figures and general ledger budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.
3. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action
4. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
5. Choose the **Insert Accounts** action.
6. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

   The accounts are now inserted into your financial report. If you want you can also change the column layout.

7. Go back to the **Financial Reports** page and choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.
8. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the desired filter name.
9. Choose **OK**.

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.

# Set Up an Intangible Assets Account

The intangible assets accounting feature allows you to post intangible assets to a special account called the Intangible Assets account. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets that cannot be physically measured. You can also include current expenses by using monthly depreciation.  

The procedure for posting an intangible asset account is similar to the procedure used to post a fixed asset account.  

## To set up an intangible asset account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a fixed asset.
3. In the **Fixed Asset Card** window, select **Intangible Asset** in the **FA Type** field.
4. Purchase and release the intangible asset. For more information, see [Purchase and Release Undepreciable Fixed Assets](Undepreciable-Fixed-Assets.md).

# Set Up VAT Ledgers

VAT ledgers are used to store details about VAT in transactions that involve goods and services in Russia or goods imported into Russia. You can create and store different kinds of VAT ledgers. For example, you can create VAT ledgers for:  

- Sales to different groups of customers
- Sales amount differences and prepayments
- Purchases from different vendor groups

To use VAT ledgers, you must specify the relevant number series.

## To set up VAT ledgers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.

2. In the **General Ledger Setup** window, on the **Numbering** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

   | Field                            | Description                                                  |
   | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **VAT Purch. Ledger No. Series** | Specifies the number series that you want to use for VAT ledgers for purchase documents. |
   | **VAT Sales Ledger No. Series**  | Specifies the number series that you want to use for VAT ledgers for sales documents. |

   You must ensure that vendor purchase documents cannot be posted without stating the invoice date and number.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.

4. In the **Vendor Posting Groups** window, for the relevant posting groups, select the **VAT Invoice Mandatory** field.

   Next, you must set up VAT posting. For each VAT posting setup you must specify if entries that use the setup must be included in VAT ledgers.

5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.

6. In the **VAT Posting Setup** window, for each VAT posting setup, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

   | Field                           | Description                                                  |
   | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Not Include into VAT Ledger** | Specifies if entries that use the setup must be included in VAT ledgers. For more information, see Not Include into VAT Ledger. |
   | **VAT Exempt**                  | Specifies if entries that use this posting setup are VAT exempt. For more information, see VAT Exempt. |

Now, you can create VAT ledgers for purchases and sales.

# VAT Overview in the Russian Version

VAT is charged on transactions that involve goods and services in Russia or goods imported into Russia.

## VAT Calculation

VAT rates in Russia are tiered into three rate levels. Each of these levels can be applied to specific types of goods and services, for example: 

- The highest VAT rate is applied to transactions that involve most types of goods and services.
- The mid-level VAT rate is applied to transactions that involve a select group of food products, children’s products, and medical goods.
- The lowest VAT rate is a tax incentive that is applied to exported goods. 

There are several business activities that are exempt from VAT in Russia. For example, insurance, banking, and medical transactions are not subject to VAT. 

An organization’s VAT liability is calculated as the difference between the VAT due on sales and the VAT from the cost of the goods or services sold. VAT is calculated for a transaction according to the rates and rules that are in effect on the day of the transaction.

## VAT Payments

For most organizations, VAT payments are required to be submitted no later than the 20th day of the month. The timely submission of VAT payments is the responsibility of the taxpayer.

# Financial Reports Overview

Financial reports are one of the main tools you can use to provide information for required statutory reports. Because of user-defined rows and columns, you can decide which data you want to compare and how. This means you can create as many customized financial statements as you want without using report designer. You can also choose to use a predefined column layout for any financial report.

To better manage the report data, you can:

- Create general ledger correspondence.
- Create constants.
- Create extensions.
- Create expressions.

Financial reports are set up on the **Financial Reports** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to print the following reports to review the general ledger account information you are using in financial reports:
>
> **G/L Account Turnover** report
> **G/L Account Card** report
> **G/L Account Entries Analysis** report

# Custom declaration
Russian legislation requires companies to record and track the customs declaration number for all imported goods. If a company sells imported goods, it must print the customs declaration number and the country/region of origin on invoices.

## Setup
> [!NOTE]
> You may need to enable this capability by going to the **Feature Management** page and enable **Feature Update: Use tracking by package number in reservation and tracking system**.

### To check the format of customs declarations
Custom declarations have a special format. You can verify that your format is correct by choosing **Yes** in the **Check CD No. Format** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. 
You must also specify a format on the **CD Number Format** page. The following table describes the symbols you can use.

|Symbol  |Use for|
|---------|---------|
|#|Any number.|
|@|Any Russian or Latin letter.|
|?|Any character|

All other characters are an exact match.

### To set up item tracking codes
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create new item tracking codes that will be used for items that require custom declaration tracking.
3. Set the **Package Specific Tracking** to **Yes** for the item tracking code.
4. Choose **CD Tracking Location Setup**, where you can define rules for specific locations. For example, you can configure a foreign location to use temporary customs declaration tracking until the moment the goods cross the border and receive a real customs declaration number.
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
6. Assign the item tracking code to all items that require customs declaration tracking. 

<!-- 
> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the Serial or Lot number specific tracking, you can add CD specific tracking to items that have open transactions.
-->

### To create a customs declaration
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Custom Declarations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new customs declaration, and fill in the following fields.

   | Field                      | Description                                                  |
   | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **No.**                    | Specifies the custom declaration number.                     |
   | **Description**            | Specifies the description of the custom declaration number.  |
   | **Source Type**            | Select the source type for the custom declaration. Source types include **Blank**, **Customer**, **Vendor**, and **Item**. |

   | **Country of Origin Code** | Specifies the country/region for the customer if all the items in the customs declaration came from the same country/region. Information from this field is copied to lines on the customs declaration. |
   | **Declaration Date**       | Enter the date of the customs declaration.                    |

3. Create lines with items according to the content of the declaration you received from the customs authority.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]
> You may want to create a temporary customer declaration to enable scenarios when goods are first received at a custom location. Set **Temporary CD Number** to **Yes** on the lines of the temporary customs declaration. You will be able to assign permanent customs declaration number when transferring goods to or from customs and your warehouse.
>
> If you choose **Yes** in the **Check CD No. Format** field on the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Temporary CD Number** field is automatically set based on what you entered in the **CD No** field.

### Purchase and Sales

# Set Up Tax Register Sections

You can either create a new tax register section or select a tax register section to be used in a company during the current taxation period. You can select a tax register section that was valid during previous taxation periods and view tax information for any of the periods. You can copy tax registers from one tax register section into another. You can also set up tax registers and adjust the algorithm of information collection into tax registers.

The following procedure shows how to set up tax register sections.

## To set up a tax register

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Registers**, and choose the related link.

2. In the **Tax Registers Sections** window, choose the **New** action.

3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the fields described in the following table.

   | Field             | Description                                                  |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Code**          | The code of the existing tax register version for a certain taxation period is displayed.   Create the code for a new tax register section, if necessary. |
   | **Description**   | Enter a description for the tax register section.            |
   | **Status**        | This field can have any one of the following values:   -   **Blocked** -   **Open** -   **Reporting** -   **Closed**   The **Blocked** status is set by default when you create a new section. This shows that a new tax register section is created and that the register does not contain any data.   Change the status to **Open manually** to continue further set up. Using this status, during tax register calculation and recalculation, you cannot check the availability of data for the previous and following taxation periods. The continuity of creating tax registers in the current period is not controlled. This status target allows you to enable debugging of the tax register calculation accuracy.   If the Status has the value **Reporting**, the continuity of tax data creation is controlled. This is the production working mode with the Tax Accounting module. In this status, only the end date must be changed.   The status value **Closed** indicates a closed taxation period. It can be set after all tax registers for the taxation period are built. |
   | **Starting Date** | Enter the start date of the tax register section.            |
   | **Ending Date**   | Enter the end date of the tax register section.              |

4. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, enter the dimension codes to filter the information selected for tax registers. Dimension codes can be changed only when the **Status** field of the tax register version has the value **Open**.

5. On the **Balance** FastTab, enter the deadlines for debtor and creditor liabilities applied in accordance with the current taxation period. For example, Debit Balance Point 1 = - 45D, Debit Balance Point 2 = - 90D.

6. On the **System** FastTab, select the actual norm code for the current tax register version in the **Norm Jurisdiction Code** field. Select the form number **17209** in the **Form ID** field.

   Choose the **OK** button.

7. In the **Tax Registers** window, choose the **Registers** action.

8. In the **Tax Register Names**window, you can add new registers to the list. To create a new tax register, do one of the following:

   1. Place the cursor in an empty line at the end of the register list and enter the information on the new register.
   2. Place the cursor on the register you want to create the new one after. Then select <kbd>F3</kbd> and enter the information on the new register.

9. Enter the fields described in the following table.

   | Field              | Description                                                  |
   | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **No.**            | Enter the number of the tax register.                        |
   | **Description**    | Enter the name of the tax register.                          |

   | **Table ID**       | Select 17208 for the tax register with storing method calculation.   For the tax register with storing method build entry depending on the source entry of the register, select one of following: **17209**, **17210**, **17211**, **17212**, **17213**, **17214**. |

Mapping of the source entries of the register and Table IDs are listed in the following table.

| Value     | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **17209** | For registers created based on general ledger entries        |
| **17210** | For registers created based on customer and vendor entries   |
| **17211** | For registers created based on fixed assets and immaterial assets entries |
| **17212** | For register created based on item entries                   |
| **17213** | For registers created based on expenses of future periods    |
| **17214** | For registers created based on the payroll entry ledger      |

If a new version of the tax register is created, the window with the register list will be empty. In this window, you can manually enter all the tax registers to be used, or you can select the **Copy Section** action in the **Tax Register Section** window and copy the register list with its settings from any of the existing tax register sections.

# Petty Cash Management

The petty cash management feature enables you to:

- Create multiple cash account cards.
- Create ingoing and outgoing cash order documents with the following specifications:
  - Number them using special numbering rules.
  - Create printing windows of the documents in the required format.
  - Post the documents.
- Void posted cash documents (checks).
- Print the following required reports:
  - Cash Order Journal CO-3
  - Cash Report CO-4.

## Cash Order Journal

To use the ingoing cash order feature, create one general journal template with the Cash Order Payment type. There can be several cash accounts in the company, and several cash points (for example cashiers) for each cash account. For each cash account, you must create a cash account with the Cash Account Card feature.

For each cash point, create a General Journal batch. The value of the **Balance Account Type** field of the batch line should be chosen as Bank Account, and the appropriate cash account should be entered in the **Balance Account Number** field.

The following procedure shows how to access the **Cash Order Journal** window.

- In **Financial Management**, choose **Cash Management**, and then choose **Cash Order Journal**.

  To create a new  cash order, or to work with an existing unposted cash order, choose the correct batch name (and accordingly the cash point). This field is required and matches the **Batch Name** field in financial journals. The **Cash Order Journal** window contains the fields listed in the following table.

| Field                 | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Posting Date**                                             | Enter the **Posting Date** field in general journals.        |
| **Document Type**                                            | Enter the **Document Type** field in general journals. The options are:   -    -   Payment -   Refund   If the value of the **Account Type** field is Client or Vendor, then the **Document Type** field is not editable, and is automatically filled in depending on the value in the **Account Type** field and the sign of the amount in the **Income** field. |
| **Prepayment**                                               | In some cases, the financial posting of payments is different in relation to the date of payment, depending on whether if it is before or after the appropriate invoice financial posting. This field should be selected in case of prepayment. |
| **Document No.**                                             | Enter the **Document Number** field in general journals.   If the value of the **Bank Payment Type** field is Computer Check, then the value of the **Document Number** field is automatically filled in after printing the ingoing cash order. The field is filled in with the next number from the number series that is specified in the **Debit Cash Order Number Series** field in the appropriate cash card. In this case, if you use the Void Check Print function on the card, clear the field.   The document number of the posted ingoing cash order is equal to the document number of the unposted ingoing cash order. |
| **Account Type**                                             | Enter the **Account Type** field in general journals. This is the type of the object that is the posting source of a cash payment. |

# Depreciation Bonus

Depreciation bonus is an accelerated depreciation method applied in tax accounting because of provisions in the Russian tax laws. A depreciation bonus enables you to include fixed asset and capital investment expenses in the current period at the rate of 10 percent or 30 percent.

## Depreciation Bonus Calculation

A depreciation bonus can be calculated and applied for the following types of transactions:

- Acquisition costs of fixed assets.
- Acquisition costs and appreciation of capital investments for all previous periods excluding the current period. 

The rate of the depreciation bonus is 10 percent or 30 percent, depending on the class of the fixed asset. The rate is set for a depreciation group using the **Depr. Bonus Percentage** field in the **Depreciation Group** window. 

After the depreciation bonus is calculated and posted for a period, all transactions are cleared in preparation for the next period.

## Depreciation Bonus Settings

Before depreciation bonus is calculated, you will have to make sure that the appropriate settings have been applied in the **Tax Register Setup** window. Use the information in the following table to apply depreciation bonus settings.

| Field                              | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rel. Act as Depr. Bonus Base**   | Select if you want fixed asset releases to be used to calculate the depreciation bonus base. |
| **Depr. Bonus TD Code**            | Enter a tax difference code that is used to calculate the depreciation bonus. The selected tax difference code should be identified as a depreciation bonus during tax difference setup. |
| **Depr. Bonus Recovery from**      | Enter the starting date from which depreciation is recovered if the fixed asset is sold. If the fixed asset is sold before this date and the depreciation bonus has already been applied, the depreciation bonus will not be recovered. |
| **Depr. Bonus Recov. Per. (Year)** | Enter the period in which the depreciation bonus is recovered if the fixed asset is sold. |
| **Depr. Bonus Recovery TD Code**   | Enter the tax difference code that is used to calculate the depreciation bonus recovery amount in tax accounting. |

## Selecting and Canceling Depreciation Bonus Transactions 

Depreciation bonus transactions should be posted before the monthly depreciation amount is calculated and posted.

To select depreciation bonus transactions for posting for a period, select **Depr. Bonus** in the **Fixed Asset Journal** window and the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** window. 

You can cancel depreciation bonus transactions by running the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. After posting the depreciation bonus cancellation, all operations that are included in the depreciation bonus base must be manually selected as the depreciation bonus base.

# Collecting Profit Tax Information for Tax Declaration

To reduce the labor required to complete a profit tax declaration and to simplify the company bookkeeping, the reporting document is split into supplements in accordance with the source. For each supplement, which is filled in by a taxpayer, a synthetic tax register is created in the tax accounting module, where all the declaration lines are stated and data sources and creation rules for each line are described. 

In the tax accounting module, the following synthetic registers of the Profit Tax Declaration Reporting document are realized: 

- Sheet 02 Profit Tax Calculation
- Supplement 1 to Sheet 02. Sales Income
- Supplement 2 to Sheet 02. Production and Sales Costs
- Supplement 3 to Sheet 02. Special Production and Sales Costs
- Supplement 4 to Sheet 02. Calculation of Loss Amount or Loss Amount Part decreasing the taxation basis
- Supplement 6 to Sheet 02. Non – Sales Costs
- Supplement 7 to Sheet 02. Non – Sales Costs and Losses to be understood as non–sale

Personal income tax calculations can be divided into three parts:

- Accrual of tax;
- Payment of taxes;
- Formation of mandatory reporting.

Calculation of the amount of personal income tax is carried out automatically at the time of the main payroll for each employee.

At the time of accounting of the salary document, the formation of operations of debt on personal income tax for each employee in correspondence with the specified code of the supplier of the tax authority and the corresponding operations in the Ledger is carried out.

Personal income tax is paid by forming a payment order to the tax authority.

- Divide the inventory lists by the physical locations of fixed assets (by Fixed Asset Location code).
- Filter the inventory lists by other analytics (such as responsible employee).
- Print the forms with inventory lists that show all inventoried fixed assets, as well as lists that show the fixed assets with differences only in quantities or amounts.
- Print unified fixed asset forms.



## Inventory Lists of Fixed Assets

You must create inventory lists of fixed assets with calculated quantities and amounts for inventory auditing. The lists are divided by analytics such as physical locations and employees responsible for certain fixed assets.

You can create special templates in the **Fixed Asset Journal** window.

The following procedure shows how to generate a list of fixed assets that are to be inventoried.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.

2. Choose the **Calculate FA** action. The request form of a report that makes fixed asset inventory lists is displayed.

3. On the **Fixed Asset** FastTab, filter the fixed assets.

   > [!NOTE]
   > They can be filtered by any parameter from the Fixed Asset card, such fixed asset location or responsible employee.

The parameters listed in the following table are on the **Options** FastTab.

| Parameter                                | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Asset Journal Template**         | Select the fixed asset journal template to work with the fixed assets list during the inventory auditing process. It is filled by default with the fixed asset journal template. |
| **Depreciation Book Code**               | Select the depreciation book with the records, which will be calculated by quantities and amounts. |
| **Starting Document No.**                | Specify the document number used to make lines in the fixed asset journal. |
| **Document Date**                        | Specify the document date.                                   |
| **Posting Date**                         | Specify the posting date. The quantities and amounts are calculated on this date. The **Posting Date** field is also filled with this value. |
| **Show Fixed Asset with Book Value = 0** | Select this field to create fixed asset journal lines for fixed assets which have a book value of zero. |

The report creates one batch in the fixed asset journal template for every fixed asset location that is filtered in the request form. For every fixed asset that is filtered, one journal line is created in the batch according to its location. A journal batch is created for fixed assets in each fixed asset location.

The following procedure shows how to begin inventory auditing by fixed asset locations.

1. Select the batch according to the fixed asset location, and choose **ОК**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can view the fixed assets lines that are filtered in the report and the lines that are in this fixed asset location.

2. Place the columns of the fixed asset journal so that you can view calculated and actual quantities and amounts. They are reflected in the following fields:

   - **Actual Quantity**
   - **Calc. Quantity**
   - **Actual Amount**
   - **Calc. Amount**



> [!NOTE]
> The amount value is the book value of the fixed asset.

# Forming and Changing the Staff List Order

You can form and change the staff list.

## Changing of Staff List

To make changes in the Staff List  go to **Human Resources > Organization > Staff list Order**

1. In the header of the order, fill the fields:

| Field                       | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No.                         | Specifies the number of the involved entry or record, according to the specified number series. |
| Document Date               | Specifies the date when the related document was created.    |
| Posting date                | Specifies the entry's posting date.                          |
| HR Order No., HR Order Date | The number and date specified in the fields are used to form the printed form of the order to make changes to the staff List |
| Description                 | Specifies the description associated with this line.         |

The HR Manager No. and Chief Accountant No. fields are filled automatically according to the organization settings.

2. The fields must be filled on the lines:

| Field  | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type   | Position/Org. Unit                                           |
| Code   | Code of position or Org. Unit                                |
| Action | Approve/Reopen/Close/Rename – type of action to be performed on this staffing item |

3. Post order.

> [!NOTE]
> Only an unoccupied position that is not the highest for any other position can be closed.
>
> A unit can be closed if all positions in it are closed.

## Forming of staff list

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there is a concept of archive staffing. Archive staffing allows you to save the status of the staff list at the time of its creation.

Staff list for any date you can see: **Human Resources > Organization > Staff List**.

By default, the staff list displays only the actual (approved) positions on the working date set in the system. The necessary data can be obtained by setting special filters on the form.

To create an archive, click the **Archive** button.

The formed staff list for the specified date is transferred to the list of posted documents. **Human Resources > Archive > Archived Staff List**

## Staff Arrangement

Staff list is document impersonal, it indicates the number of posts in the organization and salaries for them. However, some companies print a special form that is not regulated by the legislation – Staff Arrangement.

Staff Arrangement – a document that indicates which units approved in the staff list are occupied, indicating the name of the employee, their salary and allowances, and which are still vacant.

The form of  Staff Arrangement is formed on the basis of the archived staff list.

To create a printed form of Staff Arrangement, find (or form) an archive form of staff list and click the **Print** button.

When you run the report, check the box **Staff Arrangement** and select the desired mode of report generation in the field **Show Staff**.

Click OK to generate the report.

# Create additional sheets

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create additional sheets based on VAT purchase ledgers and VAT sales ledgers.

## To create entries for an additional sheet for a VAT purchase or sales ledger

1. Select the VAT purchase or sales line in the **VAT Ledger List** window with the required accounting period.

2. Choose the **Create Additional Sheet** action.

3. Fill in the batch job according to the guidelines at Create VAT Sales Led. Ad. Sh..

The annulled tax invoices have a negative sign if the corrected invoice amount is lesser than the initial amount, and a positive sign if the corrected invoice amount is greater than the initial amount. The last line is calculated as the sum of the amounts of the first total line and the annulled tax invoices.

The corrected invoices with positive amounts belong to the previous period.

Processing of corrective documents for sales book is similar to processing for purchases book with one difference. In additional sheets, the number and the date of initial factura must be reflected.

# Payroll

The basic unit of payroll is the **salary element**. Each salary element has an individual setting that provides calculation of accrual/deduction/deduction according to pre-defined rules. 

Types of salary element:

- Wage
- Bonus
- Income tax
- Tax deduction
- Deduction
- Other
- Funds

Salary elements that are similar in purpose are combined into **calculation types**. Each type of calculation has a certain priority, which determines its sequence in the overall payroll.

Other types of calculation that must be made when calculating the final or interim payments of wages, forms a **Calculated payroll group** (or **the calculation Group**). The calculation group is set in the employee card.

Main functions of the payroll module:

- Appointment of wages; 
- Implementation of compensation and incentive payments (bonuses); 
- Calculation of average earnings;
- Provision of basic types of deduction defined by the current legislation; 
- Provision of tax deductions according to the current legislation; 
- Calculation of personal income tax and payments to funds according to the current legislation.

## Payroll accounting groups

Accounting payroll group belongs to the category of special accounting groups.

For each payroll item, a payroll accounting group can be defined, the setup  determines the Ledger accounts to be used when generating transactions. The posting group that is set up for the item can be overridden in the calculation type (to enable payroll expenses to be allocated to different Ledger accounts). The accounting group specified in the calculation type has a higher priority. By default, all payroll items use the posting group specified on the employee card (the Posting group field), which has the lowest priority.

## Payroll

Payroll is performed by a special salary document, individual for each employee.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports two types of payroll documents: 

- Payment of salary in interperiod; 
- Basic payroll. 

The first type of document is used to calculate employee payments during the month (prepayment, vacation, sick leave, dismissal). When you post a payroll document of this type, no transactions are generated in the General Ledger and transactions in the payroll Ledger. On the basis of documents of this type can be formed payment documents for payment to an individual. 

The second type of document – the basic payroll – should be formed for each employee at the end of each month after taking into account all types of orders for the absence and approval of the timesheet. When you post a payroll document of the second type, transactions are generated in the payroll Ledger, as well as financial transactions in the Ledger; the resulting wage arrears are reflected on the corresponding card of the individual vendor. On the basis of the existing debt can be formed for each individual employee payment documents.

The organization and principle of calculation of both types of documents is the same:

1. Go to **Human Resources > Payrol > Payroll documents**
2. To automatically generate payroll documents, run the **Suggest documents** function.
3. Fill in the fields:

| Field                  | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Calculation Period     | Specify the period for which the salary will be calculated.  |
| Calculation Date       | The calculation date is set equal to the last day of the month of the selected calculation period and corresponds to the date of accounting of the salary document (date of payroll employee). |
| Calculation Group Code | Do not fill the field for the final payroll at the end of the month. Calculation group will be used from imployee card. To pay in the interperiod, enter the code of the desired calculation group. |
| Create New Documents   | Select the check box if you want to create new payroll documents in any case. If the field is not marked, the system will try to use previously created payroll documents for this employee (the employee Code and period Code fields must match the parameters of the current calculation) |
| Show Messages          | Select the check box to display detailed messages about errors that occur at the time of calculation. If the field is not marked, error messages will not be displayed, and incorrect payroll documents will not be generated |

4. To generate salary documents, click OK. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have generated documents but have not found any new documents in the list, try to update the page (Actions – Update).

5. For the formation of transactions in the Ledger and the possibility of payment of wages in the inter-period salary documents must be post.

# Tax Accounting

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up and maintain tax registers to track taxable profits and losses. This is based on the following tax accounting principles:

- The financial database is used for tax accounting.
- The chart of accounts is used to track taxable profits and losses.
- Income and expenses are recorded using separate subaccounts and dimensions.
- Fixed asset transactions and expenses for future periods are tracked using the depreciation book for tax accounting.
- Tax registers are grouped and totaled monthly. Each register has 12 values for a 12 month tax period. 

Because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] keeps the history of all transactions, detailed information from a transaction that changes taxable profits is automatically tracked. The information collected in tax registers meets the principles of tax reliability and tax validity.

## Tax Registers

There are two types of tax registers that are used for tracking taxable profits and losses. 

| Tax Register Type      | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analytic Tax Register  | An analytic register is based on ledger entries for taxable transactions. The information provides a continuous chronological reflection of business operations, which tracks taxable profits and losses based on tax codes. |
| Synthetic Tax Register | A synthetic register is based on summarized and calculated information from an analytic register or another synthetic register. |

Transactions are processed using specific tax accounting principles that are applied to the following types of tax registers. 

| Tax Register         | Description                                                  |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| General Ledger Entry | An analytic register based on general ledger transaction entries. |
| CV Entry             | A group of analytic registers based on information associated with debtor or creditor liabilities. |
| Fixed Asset Entry    | A group of analytic registers based on tax data for fixed assets. This group is created by using a fixed asset ledger and a tax depreciation book that is not integrated with the financial accounting ledger. |
| Item Entry           | An analytic register based on posted item transactions.      |
| Future Expense Entry | A group of analytic registers based on tax data for future expenses. This group is created by using a fixed asset ledger and a tax depreciation book that is not integrated with the financial accounting ledger. |
| Accumulation         | A synthetic register based on calculated algorithms defined during tax register set up. |
