# Period-Over-Period (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period** report provides valuable insights into your purchasing performance over time. This report compares purchasing amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, so you can identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the purchasing amount in October 2023 to the purchasing amount in October 2022. If the scope is fiscal years, the report compares the purchasing amount in fiscal year 2023 to the purchasing amount in 2022.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs can get insights into your organization's purchase spending over time. By comparing purchase amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify purchasing trends and growth.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the growth amount and growth percentage, and evaluate spending over the current fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust purchasing plans and allocate budgets effectively.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Period-Over-Period* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)  
- [**Previous Period**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-pp-fiscal)

# Design details: Creating warehouse entries

Warehouse entries contain information about item movements within the warehouse. For example, you create entries when you post a warehouse journal, or any transaction that moves items from one place to another. Each transaction can create several warehouse entries and warehouse register records. Warehouse register records have the first and last warehouse entry numbers. This information lets you identify the warehouse entries that a particular action created. And, conversely, each warehouse entry has a field that points to the warehouse register.

The following image illustrates the relationship between warehouse registers and warehouse entries for three transactions.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the relations between warehouse register records and warehouse entries.":::

## Creating warehouse transactions

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates warehouse transactions, it checks the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key to determine how to assign entry numbers to warehouse register records and warehouse entries.

### If the feature key is turned off

If the feature key is turned off, both tables are locked. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in both tables and assigns a number that is one digit higher. For example, if the last entry number is 10, then it assigns the number 11. This method of assignment ensures that warehouse entry numbers are consecutive in the warehouse register, but it blocks other users from registering warehouse transactions.

### If the feature key is turned on

If the feature key is turned on, which it is by default, entry numbers in both tables are assigned from `SequenceNumbers` in the database to allow users to register warehouse transactions at the same time. Using sequence numbers might cause warehouse entry numbers from two or more transactions to overlap, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries 2.png" alt-text="Diagram shows how warehouse register records and warehouse entries can overlap.":::

## When to turn off the feature key

You might want to turn off the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key if you work with a feature or extension that extends warehouse management and the following are true:

* The feature relies on consecutive entry numbers.
* The feature locks tables during a process.

# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.

# Design Details: Warehouse Setup

Warehouse functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains different levels of complexity, as defined by license permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license. In addition, the application objects in the license govern which UI document to use for the supported warehouse activities.  
<!--
The following warehouse-related granules exist:  

- Basic Inventory (4010)  
- Bin (4170)  
- Put Away (4180)  
- Warehouse Receipt (4190)  
- Pick (4200)  
- Warehouse Shipment (4210)  
- Warehouse Management Systems (4620)  
- Internal Picks and Put-aways (4630)  
- Automated Data Capture System (4640)
- Bin Setup (4660)  

For more information about each granule, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Price Sheets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238341) (requires PartnerSource account). -->

The following table shows which granules are required to define different warehouse complexity levels, which UI documents support each level, and which location codes reflect these levels in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration database.  

[!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Bin and Bin Content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It is the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as bin content. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

A bin content can be given a property of Fixed, Dedicated, or Default to define how the bin content can be used. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question. The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied, the bin content does not disappear, and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource, such as a machine center, that uses the bin in question. Other non-pick content, such as quantities outbound on a shipment posting, can still be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

The Default bin property is used by the system to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At WMS locations, the Default bin property is not used. At locations where bins are required, the property is used in inbound flows to specify where to place items. In outbound flows, the property is used to specify where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound items are placed in several bins, then items are first taken from the non-default bins, to empty that bin content, and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

There can only be one default bin per item per location.  

## Bin Type

In WMS installations, you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it. The following bin types exist:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items posted as received but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. The replenishment of these bins can only be made by movement, not by put-away.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

For all bin types, except PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY, no other activity is allowed for the bin than what is defined by its bin type. For example, a bin of type **Receive** can only be used to receive items into or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC. Similarly, only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC.  

## Bin Ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally.  

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Similarly, pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking. Furthermore, bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse.  

## Bin Setup  
In advanced warehousing, bins can be set up with capacity values, such as quantity, total cubage, and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin.  

On each item card, you can assign a unit of measure (UOM) for the item, such as pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also have a base UOM for an item and specify larger UOMs that are based on it. For example, you can define a pallet to equal 16 pieces, the latter being the base UOM.  

If you want to set a maximum quantity of a specific item to be stored in an individual bin and the item has more than one UOM, then you must set the maximum quantity for every UOM that exists on the item card. Accordingly, if an item has been set up to be handled in pieces and pallets, then the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin is not calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations. I all other configurations, bin contents can only be in the base UOM. In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

## Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or several bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone.  

## Class  
In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to items, bins, and zones to control where different item classes are stored, such as frozen goods. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, items in the receiving zone can be stored as frozen, hazardous, or other class.  

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins are not assigned, then the quantity cannot be received.  

## Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped, potentially organized in bins. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant.  

## First Expired First Out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** check box on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card, then item-tracked items are picked according to their expiration date. The items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items in question already have serial/lot numbers assigned. If only a part of the quantity on the line already has serial/lot numbers assigned, then the remaining quantity to be picked is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, the available items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, then the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, then the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to this temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

## Put-away Template

The put-away template can be assigned to an item and to a location. The put-away template specifies a set of prioritized rules that must be respected when creating put-aways. For example, a put-away template may require that the item is placed in a bin with bin content that matches the UOM, and if a similar bin with enough capacity cannot be found, then the item must be placed in an empty bin.

# Correct prepayments

You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you can't delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well.

## To correct a prepayment

The following procedure shows how to issue a prepayment credit memo to cancel all invoiced prepayments for a sales order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.
3. Choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Credit Memo** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Cr. Memo** action.  
4. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, proceed to correct the relevant entries, as for any sales credit memo. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To reduce the amount in the **Line Amount** field, you must first increase the prepayment percentage on the line so that the value in the **Prepmt. Line Amount** field is not decreased below the value in the **Prepmt. Amt. Inv.** field.

5. To make a prepayment invoice for any new lines in the sales credit memo, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  
6. To issue an additional prepayment invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced and the new prepayment amounts.

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Categorize items

To maintain an overview of your items and to help you sort and find items, it's useful to organize your items in item categories.

To find items by characteristics, you can assign item attributes to items and also to item categories. For more information, see [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4c02e1d8-7569-4eb4-94cf-105899787978]

## To create an item category
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Categories**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Categories** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Item Category Card** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Attributes** FastTab, specify any item attributes for the item category. For more information, see [To assign item attributes to item categories](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md#assign-item-attributes-to-item-categories).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the item category has a parent item category, as indicated by the **Parent Category** field, then any item attributes that are assigned to that parent item category are prefilled on the **Attributes** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item attributes that you assign to an item category will automatically apply to the item that the item category is assigned to.

If you change your mind about an item category, you can delete it. However, if the category is assigned to an item, you must remove that assignment beforehand.

## To assign an item category to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.

# Create special orders

You can create a special order for a specific catalog item to be shipped to a specific customer. Your vendor ships the item to your warehouse and you can then ship the item on to your customer either independently or together with other items on another order.  

Special orders imply that the purchase and sales order are linked to ensure that the specific catalog item is picked and delivered to the customer.  

Before you can use this feature, you must first set up the customer, vendor, and item cards necessary for the order.  

## To create a special order

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. Create and fill in a  sales order for the item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the sales line. In the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Special Order** field selected.

    You must now create a purchase order from a requisition worksheet.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Choose the **Special Order** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Orders** action.  
6.  On the **Get Sales Orders** page, show results where the **Document No.** is the sales order number. Choose the **OK** button. A requisition worksheet line is created for the item.  
7.  On the requisition worksheet line, in the **Action Message** field, select **New**.  
8.  On the **Requisition Worksheets** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action. The **Carry Out Action Msg. - Req.** page opens. Choose the **OK** button.  

    A message appears telling you that the purchase orders have been created. Choose the **OK** button.  

A purchase order created as a special order for a sales order is respected by the planning system as it balances demand and supply. That is, the purchase order (supply) remains linked to the sales order (demand), even if that purchase order could supply another earlier demand. For more information, see [Design Details: Reordering Policies](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot use the special order functionality if the item is already reserved. Therefore, for items that are sold on special orders, make sure the **Reserve** field on the item card is not set to **Always**.

# Invoice projects

During a project, costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It's important to record all costs in the project journal before you invoice the customer. You can invoice customers after the project is finished, or at certain intervals based on an invoicing schedule.

You can invoice:

* Multiple projects using a **Project Create Sales Invoice** task.
* Whole projects, projects within a project, or individual project planning lines using the relevant action in the project pages.
* Combine multiple project planning lines from different projects into a single sales invoice using **Get Project Planning Lines** action on the **Sales Invoice** page.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks:

* When the work to invoice is complete.
* When you reach the date for invoicing set on an invoicing schedule.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters to specify the projects to invoice.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices on the **Sales Invoices** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Project Sales Invoice** action, or use the **Create Sales Invoice** action in the project tasks.

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and specify the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.

    The **Sales Invoice** page opens, showing the quantity that you transferred to the invoice.
9. Make any other changes, and then choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> The procedure is similar for creating, reviewing, and posting a project-related sales credit memo.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## Issue a credit memo for a project

When a credit is due to a customer for something you invoiced for a project, you can create a credit memo to reimburse them. You can issue a credit memo for job planning lines of the types **Billable** or **Both Budget and Billable**. This credit memo ensures that job planning always reflects the correct planned invoice/credit memo lines for the project before you post sales invoices and credit memos. To learn more about sales credit memos, go to [Process sales returns or cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

To issue a credit memo for a planning line, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the project you want to issue a credit memo for.
1. If the **Blocked** field is filled in, clear the field so that you can work with the project.
1. In the **Status** field, change the status from **Completed** to **Open**.
1. Choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
1. Create a new planning line, and enter the same information as the line you want to credit. However, in the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity but as a negative value. For example, if the quantity you want to credit is 10, enter a quantity of -10.

# Design Details: Cost Components
Cost components are different types of costs that make up the value of an inventory increase or decrease.  

 The following table shows the different cost components and any subordinate cost components that they consist of.  

|Cost Component|Subordinate Cost Component|Description|  
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Direct cost|Unit cost (direct purchase price)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Freight cost (item charge)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Insurance cost (item charge)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Indirect cost||Cost that cannot be traced to a cost object.|  
|Variance|Purchase variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Material variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Subcontracted variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Manufacturing overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Revaluation||A depreciation or appreciation of the current inventory value.|  
|Rounding||Residuals caused by the way in which valuation of inventory decreases are calculated.|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Freight and insurance costs are item charges that can be added to an item’s cost at any time. When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the value of any related inventory decreases are updated accordingly.

# Block customers
You can block a customer, for example because of insolvency, so that the customer can't be added to sales documents or so that no transactions can be posted for the customer.

In addition to blocking a customer, you can set receivable transactions for the customer to be on hold in connection with reminders. For more information, see [Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).   

The following table describes the options for blocking customers.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this customer.|
|**Ship**|New orders and new shipments can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can be invoiced.|  
|**Invoice**|New orders, new shipments, and new invoices can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can't be invoiced. You can still send reminders and finance charge memos to the customer.|  
|**All**|No transaction is allowed for this customer, including payments.|  

## To block a customer  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose what to block, as described in the table above.

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# Connect E-Documents to external access points

[!INCLUDE [e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

You can use E-Documents in Business Central to send and receive electronic documents with your business partners. To receive documents, you need to connect E-Documents to an external access point that handles the communication and validation of the documents. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > These connections require communication with external service providers who might be subject to additional payment and require contracts with them. To obtain all the necessary credentials, contact the service providers.

The steps to connect E-Documents to an external access point depend on the type of connector you choose.    

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your service provider for all the necessary details to establish a connection with their access point that follows.  

## Pagero service

1. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, select the **Open OAuth 2.0 setup** action to open the **OAuth 2.0 Setup** page.  
2. On the **OAuth 2.0 setup** page, select the **Request Authorization Code** action. You're redirected to the external service authorization webpage and prompted for your sign-in details.
3. Copy the authorization code into the **Enter Authorization Code** field.  
4. Select **Refresh Access Token** to make sure that you can refresh the token. 
5. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | FileAPI URL | Specify the file API URL. |
    | Fileparts URL | Specify the fileparts URL. |
    | DocumentAPI URL | Specify the document API URL. |
    | Company ID | Specify the company ID. |
    | Send Mode | Specify the send mode. You can select **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification**. |

6. Continue with the [nonservice provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).  

## Avalara service

> [!NOTE]
> The Avalara connector in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available from version 25.1

1. On the **Avalara Connection Setup** page, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields. In the **Send Mode** field, choose the **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification** option, based on your plans. 
2. Select the **Select Avalara Company Id** action, and choose the right company. Make sure you enter values into the **Company Name** and **Company ID** fields.  
3. Select the **Select Avalara Mandate** action, and select the right **E-Document Service**, and then pick appropriate **Country Mandate** code on the **Avalara Mandate List** page. 
4. Navigate back to the **E-Document Service** page, and validate that the **Avalara Mandate** field in the **Avalara** FastTab is set with the value you chose. 
5. Continue with the [non-service provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).

## Available service providers

At this moment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports Pagero and Avalara access points for e-documents, but more access points are in the process of development. This page is updated with the parameters for new connectors when they're ready. You can also find more connectors on AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> This page doesn't show how to connect with the local service providers. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support some of them, it will be explained in the country-specific documentation.  

Microsoft doesn't have a contractual obligation with Pagero and Avalara. That means, if you want to use their connectors, you must have a contract with them.

# Incoming documents

External business documents can come into your company as an email attachment or a paper copy that you scan to file. This scenario is typical of purchases, where such incoming document files represent payment receipts for expenses or small purchases.

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

## Usage scenario

You can register files or paper copies received from your trading partners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and create a document record. For example, a purchase or sales invoice, credit memo or a journal line.

Upload the received files, or use your device's camera to take a photo, and create entries to represent the external documents. Optionally, with PDF or image files, you can have an external optical character recognition (OCR) service generate electronic documents that can then be converted to records inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. Alternatively, some OCR providers offer the option of processing files forwarded to a dedicated email address, which then automatically creates a related incoming document record. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

> [!TIP]
> Create incoming document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] directly from emails sent by vendors using the Outlook add-in. To learn more, go to [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

## Incoming document features

The incoming document process can consist of the following main activities:

* Record the external documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by creating lines on the **Incoming Documents** page in the following ways:
  * Manually, either from a PC or from a mobile device, in one of the following ways:
    * Use the **Create from File** button, upload a file, and then fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page.
    * Use the **New** button, fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page and manually attach the related file.
    * From a tablet or phone, use the **Create from Camera** button to create a new incoming document record using the device's built-in camera.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To use a mobile phone, you must install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. The app is available on the App Store and on Google Play. To learn more, go to [Getting Business Central on your mobile device](install-mobile-app.md).

  * Automatically, by receiving the document from the OCR service as an electronic document after you've uploaded or emailed the related PDF or image file to an OCR service. The **Financial Information** FastTab is automatically filled on the **Incoming Document** page.
* Use an external OCR service to have PDF or image files turned into electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Create new documents or general journal lines for incoming document records by entering the information as you read it from incoming document files.
* Attach incoming document files to purchase and sales documents of any status, including to the vendor, customer, and general ledger entries that result from posting.
* View incoming document records and their attachments from any purchase and sales document or entry, or find all general ledger entries without incoming document records from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached to cards and documents on the **Attachments** tab aren't included on the **Incoming Documents** page. To learn more, go to [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

# Accessibility and Keyboard Shortcuts

This article provides information about the features that make [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] readily available to people with disabilities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following accessibility features:  

- Keyboard shortcuts. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).
- Touch and pen gestures on tablets and phones. See [Touch and Pen Gestures](touch-gestures.md).
- Navigation  
- Headings  
- Alternative text for images and links  
- Support for common assistive technologies 
- Zoom in or out on any page
- Tooltips on elements in the user interface

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation
  
You can use different combinations of the Tab, Shift, and arrow keys of your keyboard to move between elements on a page. Elements include actions, fields and columns, parts, and other controls. In general, select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous element.

When you focus on an area that contains actions, like the navigation bar on the top of role center or action bar on other pages, use the arrows keys to move through the different actions and groups. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a group to open its underlying actions, and then continue using the arrows keys. Select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the action area.

By using the tab order, you can also switch between the main browser page and dialog boxes that request confirmation, for example, or the sign-in page.  

## <a name="Headings"></a> Headings in Content

The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4).  

## <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links

A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  

## <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages.  

## <a name="zoom"></a> Zoom

Most browsers use standard keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the current page. These keyboard shortcuts aren't specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they work when you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser. For a list of supported keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming In and Out](keyboard-shortcuts.md#zoomshortcuts).

## Tooltips

Tooltips are available on most elements in the user interface, like page fields and columns, actions, cues tiles, and charts. A tooltip provides extra text that explains an element to help you better understand its purpose. 

Tooltips are accessed in different ways, depending on the client (web or mobile) and the device that you're working with. Use the following table as a guide. Some tooltips can be read by screen-readers. In this case, you access the tooltips as described in the table, then use the screen reader to navigate to the tooltip as you would with any other element.

#### Accessing tooltips

|Element|Mouse action for web client|Keyboard shortcut for web client|Touch gesture on tablet/phone for mobile app|Screen reader support|
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
|Page fields and column headings|Hover over or click the field caption or column heading|Move focus to the field or column heading, and select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys|Tap the field caption |yes|
|Charts elements, like a bar, line, pie slice|Hover over the element|Move focus to element, for example, by using arrow keys|Tap and hold the element|yes|
|Actions|Hover over the action|none|none |no|
|Cue tiles|Hover over the tile |none|none|no|


<!--
- With a mouse, hover over the element.

title: Design Details - Item Tracking Posting Structure
description: Learn how to use item ledger entries as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers in the Item Tracking Posting Structure.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure
To align with inventory costing functionality and to obtain a simpler and more robust solution, item ledger entries are used as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers.  
  
Item tracking numbers on order network entities and non-order network entities are specified in the **Reservation Entry** table (T337). Item tracking numbers that are related to historical information are retrieved directly from the item ledger entries that are related to the transaction in question. This means that item ledger entries reflect the item tracking specification of the posted order line.  
  
The **Item Tracking Lines** page retrieves the information from T337 and the item ledger entries and shows it through the temporary table, **Tracking Specification** (T336). T336 also hold the temporary data in the **Item Tracking Lines page** for item tracking quantities that remain to be invoiced.  
  
## One-to-Many Relation  
The **Item Entry Relation** table, which is used to link a posted document line with its related item ledger entries, consists of two main parts:  
  
* A pointer to the posted document line, the **Order Line No.** field.  
* An entry number pointing to an item ledger entry, the **Item Entry No.** field.  
  
The functionality of the existing **Entry No.** field, which relates an item ledger entry to a posted document line, handles the typical one-to-one relation when no item tracking numbers exist on the posted document line. If item tracking numbers exist, then the **Entry No.** field is left blank, and the one-to-many relation is handled by the **Item Entry Relation** table. If the posted document line carries item tracking numbers but only relates to a single item ledger entry, then the **Entry No.** field handles the relation, and the no record is created in the **Item Entry Relation** table.  
  
## Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post)
To split the item ledger entries during posting, the code in codeunit 80 and codeunit 90, is encircled by loops that run through global temporary record variables. This code calls codeunit 22 with an item journal line. These variables are initialized when item tracking numbers exist for the document line. To keep the code simple, this looping structure is always used. If no item tracking numbers exist for the document line, then a single record is inserted, and the loop runs only once.  
  
## Posting the Item Journal  
Item tracking numbers are transferred via the reservation entries that relate to the item ledger entry, and the looping through item tracking numbers occurs in codeunit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line). This concept works in the same way when an item journal line is used indirectly to post a sale or purchase order as when an item journal line is used directly. When the item journal is used directly, the **Source Row ID** field points to the item journal line itself.  
  
## Code Unit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line)
Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) loop the call of codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) during the invoice posting of item tracking numbers and during the invoicing of existing shipments or receipts.  
  
During quantity posting of item tracking numbers, codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) retrieves item tracking numbers from the entries in T337 (Reservation Entry) that relate to the posting. These entries are placed directly on the item journal line.  
  
Codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) loops through the item tracking numbers and splits the posting into the respective item ledger entries that carry the item tracking numbers. Information about which item ledger entries are created is returned to T337(Reservation Entry)by using a temporary T336 record, which is called by a procedure in codeunit 22. This procedure is triggered when codeunit 22 has finished its run because at that point, the codeunit 22 object contains the information. When the temporary T336 record is retrieved, Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) create records in the **Item Entry Relation** table to link the created item ledger entries to the created shipment or receipt line. Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) then converts the temporary T336 (Tracking Specification) records to real T336 (Tracking Specification) records that are related to the line in question. However, this conversion occurs only if the posted document line is not deleted, because it is only partially posted.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, may have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse
1. Open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, and then turn off the **Enabled** toggle. Then close the page to disconnect from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, and in the **Ownership Model** field, choose **Person**. Then choose the **Enabled** toggle to turn on the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to Dataverse.
4. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** to reinstall the Business Central Integration Solution.
5. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to reconnect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This enables integration with tables that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as sales orders, quotes, and invoices.
6. On the **Sales Connection Setup** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup** to initialize the integration table mappings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Using the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action will apply the default integration table mappings. All custom mappings will be overwritten. If you have custom mappings that you want to keep, we recommend that you export them to Excel or talk to your Microsoft partner about other ways to keep your custom mappings.

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

# Manage project supplies

You should manage project supplies of items, services, and expenses as an integral part of all projects. You can use inventory quantities or make project-specific purchases through purchase orders or purchase invoices. For example, when service on a computer requires a new disk, you create a purchase invoice to buy a new disk and record the project that uses it.

If the purchase process doesn't require you to record the physical transaction separately, you can process a purchase on the **Project G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [To post a project-related expense](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md#to-post-a-project-related-expense).

## Manual or semi-automated replenishment

If you already know which supplies you need to replenish for a project, you can create a purchase order. To learn more, go to [Manual or semi-automated replenishment](#manual-or-semi-automated-replenishment).

However, if you aren't sure what you're missing, you can use a semi-automated process where you create a purchase order directly from a project. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps by listing all items and shows whether they're available or unavailable. You can adjust the quantities to replenish on the lines.  

The semi-automated process creates a purchase order for each vendor from which you purchase the items, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page. You can continue to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines.

Later, you can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action. To learn more, go to [Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project](#use-a-semi-automated-replenishment-process-for-a-project).

> [!NOTE]
> As in other cases that involve advanced inventory processes, such as reservation, warehousing, and assemble-to-order, the project's status must be **Open** and the **Apply Usage Link** toggle must be turned on.

### Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a project that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.
4. The **Create Purchase Orders** page shows a line for each item on the project. Lines for both fully available quantities and unavailable quantities show by default. To show only unavailable quantities, choose the **Show Unavailable** action.
5. The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable quantity. To purchase a different quantity, edit the value in the field.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on unavailable lines, even though they represent fully available quantities.

6. You can also turn on the **Reserve** toggle if you want to reserve the quantity on the purchase line against a demand instead of filling out the **Project No.** and **Project Task NO.** fields on the purchase line. By default, the **Reserve** toggle is hidden on the page. You can personalize the page to add the toggle. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
7. Select **OK**.

You can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action.

### Replenish a project manually

The following procedure shows how to use a purchase invoice to purchase products for a project. The same steps apply when using a purchase order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action and fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. In the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields, select the information of the project that you want to purchase items or services for. Use the personalization tools if a field isn't visible. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    The value that you select in the **Project Line Type** field defines whether a planning line is created when you post the usage of the item. If the field contains **Billable**, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. To learn more, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md).

### How posting purchases affects inventory and WIP

When you post a receipt, the inventory is received and immediately written-off by an item ledger entry of the type **Negative Adjustment**. To avoid affecting WIP calculation, the project ledger entries don't include purchase order lines that aren't of the type **G/L Account**.

Project ledger entries are created as follows:

* From a purchase order, when you choose the **Post** action and choose **Invoice**.
* From a purchase invoice, when you choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action on the **Lines** FastTab, and then the **Post** action.

### To view the value of purchases for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.

    On the **Tasks** FastTab, the **Outstanding Orders** field shows the total outstanding amount, in local currency, of inventory items and services on purchase documents for the project task line.  

    The **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced** field shows the value of items delivered on purchase documents but not invoiced.  
3. Choose either of the fields to open the **Purchase Lines** page where you can review information about the related purchase document lines, including which items or services are received.

## To post a project-related expense

If you incur extraordinary or one-time project expenses, you can use the **Project G/L Journal** page to post them directly to the relevant project account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line and enter information about the expense, including information in the **Project No.** and **Project Task No** fields.  
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

## Receive items for projects with warehouse receipts or put-aways

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers advanced warehouse handling for purchase orders that are linked to projects. Save some time by using warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways to directly receive and register usage of items for projects.

Use the following methods to receive items:

- Post receipt and consumption from the order line.
- Post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document.
- Post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document.

### To post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document

When your location is set up to require processing put-aways but not receipts, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your purchase orders.

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:

- Create the inventory put-away directly from the purchase order by choosing the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
- Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement** batch job.
- Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the purchase orders to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document on the **Inventory Put-away** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If bins are mandatory for the location, make sure that the **Bin Code** is filled in the purchase order lines.

### To post the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.
1. Enter the quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.
1. After you put away the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines that were put away. There are two item ledger entries for each line. One entry for receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project. There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice. If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

### To post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document

You must get the lines from the released purchase order that the receipt is for. You can create warehouse receipts in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action on the **Purchase Order** page to create warehouse receipt for a source document.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action on the **Purchase Order** page to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a warehouse receipt for one or more released source documents.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use bins, the default bin is suggested. You can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in.

### To post the warehouse receipt

1. On the **Warehouse Receipts** page, open the warehouse receipt.
1. The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed.
1. After you received the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines. There are two item ledger entries for each receipt line. One entry for the receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project.

There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice.

If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Warehouse put-away documents aren't created, even if your warehouse processes require both receipt and warehouse put-away.

### Good to know

- Return orders aren't supported for locations with directed put-away and pick. You need to undo consumption via a project journal, and then create return order for items in inventory.
- If purchase documents were created before the update, you can post them directly. If you want to use warehouse handling, reopen and release the purchase orders again.
- You can't edit the **No.**, **Variant Code**, **Project No.**, and **Project Task No.** fields on purchase lines if warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways exist.

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Get more out of the communications between your salespeople and customers by turning email exchanges into actionable opportunities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can work with Exchange Online to keep a log of the inbound and outbound messages. You can view and analyze the contents of each message on the **Interaction Log Entries** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online must be on the same tenant.

## To set up email logging

### Set up public folders and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online.

### Set Up a shared mailbox and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These steps require administrator access for Exchange Online.

Prepare a shared mailbox in the Exchange admin center. Alternatively, you can also use Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Create a shared mailbox](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox) or [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Exchange Management PowerShell, your changes are available in the Exchange admin center after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

### Add a user account for members of the shared mailbox

The account that you use for email logging is an Exchange Online account. The scheduled job uses the account to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account shouldn't be associated with a specific person. Add the email account to the members for the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Use the EAC to edit shared mailbox delegation](/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).

### Allow other users to see logged emails

You can allow another user to open an email message in Exchange that is related to an interaction log entry from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To do that, give the user ``Read`` permission to the **Archive** folder in the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Mail flow rules look for specific conditions on messages and take action on them. Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table. For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

|Purpose  |Name  |Apply this rule if...  |Do the following...  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|A rule for incoming email     |Log Email Sent to This Organization|The sender is located outside the organization, and the recipient is located inside the organization|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|
|A rule for outgoing email     |Log Email Sent from This Organization|The sender is located inside the organization, and the recipient is located outside the organization.|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only processes messages in the Inbox folder in the shared mailbox. If a rule moves messages from the Inbox to another folder, those messages will not be processed. Additionally, messages in the Junk Mails folder are also ignored.

## Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to log email messages

Get started with email logging in two easy steps:

1. Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online for your Microsoft 365 subscription. Exchange Online handles your email messages. We made this step easy by providing an assisted setup guide. You just need your administrator credentials for your administrator account in Microsoft 365. To start the guide, go to the **Assisted Setup** page, and then select the **Set up email logging** guide.  

2. Make sure that the email addresses for your sales people and contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are valid. To do that, for each customer or salesperson, open the **Contact** or **Salesperson/Purchaser** card and have a look in the **Email** field.

    > [!Tip]
    > After you complete the steps in the guide you can check whether the connection was successful. Search for **Email Logging**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Validate Setup**.

## View email message exchanges in the Interaction Log

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry on the **Interaction Log** page each time a salesperson and a contact exchange an email message. To view the interaction log, open the **Contact** card for the person, choose **Related**, then **History**, and then **Interaction Log Entries**. There are a few things you can do with each entry in the log, for example:

* View the content of the email message that was exchanged by selecting **Process** and then **Show Attachments**.
* Turn an email exchange into a sales opportunity. If an entry looks promising, you can turn it into an opportunity and then manage its progress toward a sale. To turn an email exchange into an opportunity, choose the entry, then **Process**, and then **Create Opportunity**. For more information, see [Managing Sales Opportunities](marketing-manage-sales-opportunities.md).

## Mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online

There are mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online, such as limits for folder sizes and the number of messages. For more information, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits) and [Limits for public folders in Exchange Server](/Exchange/collaboration/public-folders/limits?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores logged email messages in a folder in Exchange Online. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also stores a link to each logged message. The links open the logged messages in Exchange Online from the Interaction Log Entries, Contact Card, and Salespersons Card pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a logged message is moved to another folder, the link is broken. For example, a message might be moved manually, or Exchange Online might automatically start AutoSplit when a storage limit is reached.

The following steps can help you avoid breaking links to messages in Exchange Online.

1. Don't move existing messages to another folder after you change settings for your email logging setup. Keeping existing messages put preserves the links. Links to messages in the new folder are valid.
2. Avoid reaching the mailbox and folder limits. If you're about to reach a limit, take the following steps:
    1. Set up a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
    2. Update your email flow rules in Exchange Online.
    3. Update your email logging setup in Business Central accordingly

## Connect on-premises versions to Microsoft Exchange

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises or Exchange Online for email logging. For both versions of Exchange, settings for the connection are available on the **Marketing Setup** page. For Exchange Online, you can also use an assisted setup guide.

<!-- [!IMPORTANT]
> The new experience doesn't support a connection to Exchange on-premises. If you must use Exchange on-premises, do not enable the feature update for the new experience.

## Connect to Exchange on-premises
<!--
## [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises, on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can use **Basic** as the **Authentication Type**, and then enter credentials for the user account for Exchange on-premises. Then turn on the **Enabled** toggle to start logging email.

## [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)
The new experience does not support connections to Exchange on-premises.
-->
## Connect to Exchange Online

To connect to Exchange Online, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is preset and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online). 

You must also use **OAuth2** as the **Authentication Type**. You must also register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is prepopulated and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online).

You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret is saved as an encrypted string in your database.

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, choose **Authentication**.
2. Under **Redirect URL**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the redirect URL field on the Email Logging page is empty, find the suggested redirect URL on the **Assisted Setup** page. To open the page, on the **Email Logging** page, choose **Actions**, and then **Assisted Setup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not specify the redirect URL, you can do so later by choosing **Add a platform**, and then choosing **Web** to add the web application and the redirect URL.

3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then choose **Delegated permissions**.
4. Use the search box to find and select **Mail**, and then add the **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared** permission.
5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You use the secret either in the **Client Secret** field on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This value is the client ID of your application. You must enter it either in the **Client ID** field on the **Email Logging** page.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up email logging on the **Email Logging** page, or use the **Assisted Setup** guide for assistance.

### Use Another Identity and Access Management Service

If you aren't using Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access, you need some help from a developer. If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetEmailLoggingClientId and OnGetEmailLoggingClientSecret events in codeunit 1641 "Setup Email Logging."

## To start logging email

1. To start logging email, on the **Email Logging** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
2. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not prompted to sign in the the Exchange Online account, it might be because your browser is blocking pop-ups. To sign in, allow pop-ups from https://login.microsoftonline.com.

## To stop logging email

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

## To change the user account used for email logging

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account must have access to both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link. 
3. Choose **Related**, and then **Job Queue Entry**.
4. Restart the **Email Logging** job.

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Actions**, and then **Renew Token**.
3. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# Change the Annual Amount on Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You can change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote to correct the amount that will be invoiced annually.  

## To change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contract or contract quote.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract or contract quote for editing.  
4. Choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box to automatically distribute the annual amount difference on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. Change the contents of the **Annual Amount** field. You cannot sign, that is, convert into a service contract if you are working on a contract quote, or lock a service contract that has a negative annual amount. If you set the annual amount to zero, the contents of the **Invoice Period** field must be **None** when either signing or locking the service contract.  
6. Depending on whether the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is selected, run either the manual or automatic distribution of the annual amount difference. The contract lines will be updated so that the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field value is equal to the new annual amount.  

## Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. There are three ways to distribute amounts:

* Even distribution  
* Distribution based on line amounts  
* Distribution based on Profit

### Even Distribution
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines. The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The difference between the new **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values is divided by the number of the contract lines in the service contract or contract quote.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding the result of the previous operation.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:   
    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount.  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100.  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost.  

 The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|0.00|0.00|40.00|10.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|10.00|5.00|45.00|5.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|10.00|7.00|63.00|13.00|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  40 + 45 + 63 = 148.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 139, the amount is calculated that should be added to each **Line Amount** field value. This amount is calculated by subtracting the **Calcd. Annual Amount** from the new **Annual Amount** field value and dividing the result by the number of the contract lines in the service contract. In this case, it will be equal to the following: (139 - 148) / 3 = -3. Then, the last calculated figure is added to each **Line Amount** field value and the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|7.50|3.00|37.00|7.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|16.00|8.00|42.00|2.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|14.29|10.00|60.00|10.00|  

### Distribution Based on Line Amount
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Line Amount is an automatic method that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their line amount shares in the calculated annual amount. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The line amount percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Line Amount** field is divided by the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the line amount percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Discount Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|3.00|0.51|25.00|1.49|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|None|0.00|55.10|3.00|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|3.00|0.81|112.70|2.19|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following: 16.49 + 23.00 + 26.19 = 65.68.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 60, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line is calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +12.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas described in the procedure above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|11.41|1.94|15.06|0.06|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|8.65|1.99|21.01|1.01|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|11.37|3.07|23.93|-0.07|  

### Distribution Based on Profit
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Profit is one of the automatic methods that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their profit shares in the total contract or contract quote profit. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The profit percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Profit** field is divided by the sum of **Profit** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the profit percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the Line Discount Amount, Line Discount %, and Profit fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|0.00|0.00|25.00|5.00|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|5.00|2.90|55.10|5.10|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|2.00|2.30|112.70|12.70|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  25.00 + 55.10 + 112.70 = 192.80.  

 If you change the **Annual Amount** to 180, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line are calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +1 2.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the step 3 of the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|11.24|2.81|22.19|2.19|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|9.93|5.76|52.24|2.24|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|8.20|9.43|105.57|5.57|

# Finance Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to use embedded Power BI reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with predefined KPIs.

The Power BI reports on finance data support many analytics scenarios for finance processes.

Executives and the leadership team consume the data through high-level dashboards that present key performance indicators (KPIs) for finance. The KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, and highlight important performance metrics. This approach helps business leaders quickly assess performance toward strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

Managers and team leaders engage with the data through detailed managerial reports that showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas that need attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons that help you understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

Finance staff accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports offer task-specific information for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

You can use the various reports in the Power BI Finance app for different things, depending on your role. This article describes some examples of use cases for different roles in an organization.

## Finance analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Sample scenario for a CFO

As the CFO, you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting and need an analysis of your company's financial position for the current fiscal quarter.

Using the [Financial Overview (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-financial-overview.md), you begin with a comparative analysis of revenues. This quarter's revenue of $281,000 represents a significant increase compared to the same period last year of $242,000, marking a growth of $39,000, or approximately 16.1%. This positive trend indicates strong performance and suggests that current strategies are effectively increasing revenue.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png":::

You want to compare the net profit margin for the current quarter to the same period in the previous year. You quickly identify that net profit margins are slightly lower, but you need more information to determine why.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Net Profit Margin visual" lightbox="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png":::

By analyzing the [Profitability](finance-powerbi-profitability.md) report, you can easily see that expenses are up from 3.60 K to 11.85 K for the same period. Although revenue is up by approximately 16.1%, the increase in expenses suppressed growth and produced a marginal increase in profits.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Profitability report" lightbox="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png":::

To ensure the company is able to cover its short-term obligations, fund new initiatives, and maintain operational stability you review the liquidity report and cash reserves.

The cash ratio of 1.0 indicates that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents (1.02M) to pay off all current liabilities (1.02M) immediately, if needed. The quick ratio of 1.15 indicates that without including inventory in current assets, the company can still cover its short-term debts without relying on sales of inventory. Overall, the current ratio of 1.21 indicates the company is in a balanced but cautious liquidity position with current assets of $1.24M to current liabilities of 1.02M.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for the management team

As the Operations Manager, you oversee service delivery across various customer segments. These customer groups are tracked as dimensions values (Large, Medium, and Small) by the **Customer Group** global dimension.

By filtering the [Budget Comparison (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-budget-comparison.md) by **Global Dimension 2** and **G/L Account Category** to **Income** and **Expense**, you can easily track budget performance. This data lets you allocate resources effectively, control the budget, and make data-driven decisions when you forecast.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Budget Comparison report" lightbox="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for daily finance work

As a member of the accounts receivable team, you manage the inflow of cash by ensuring timely and efficient collection of payments from customers. To monitor and prioritize your efforts, you use the [Aged Receivables (Back Dating) (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-aged-receivables-back-dating.md).

Analyzing by payment terms code allows you to quickly identify customers who have outstanding balances in aging buckets beyond 30 days. You can now prioritize not only customers, but the invoices those customers should pay first.

# Let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you complete tasks quicker and more correctly by prefilling fields or complete lines with data that you would otherwise have to calculate and enter yourself. Although such automatic data entry is always correct, you can change it afterwards if you want to.

Functionality that enters field values for you is typically offered for tasks where you enter large volumes of transactional data and want to avoid errors and save time. This article contains a selection of such functionality. More sections will be added in future updates of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## The **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page
When, for example, you're entering general journal lines for multiple expenses that must all be posted to the same bank account, then each time you enter a new journal line for an expense, you can have the **Amount** field on the bank account line automatically updated to the amount that balances the expenses. For more information about working with general journals, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

### To have the **Amount** field on balancing general journal lines filled automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the line for your preferred general journal batch, choose the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box.
3. Open the general journal and proceed to register and post transactions using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.       

For information about how to set up a personal general journal batch, for example, for expense handling, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

## The **Automatically Fill Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page
The **Register Customer Payments** page shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment. For more information about applying customer payments, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

Your main actions on the page are to fill in the **Payment Made** check box and the **Date Received** field. You can set [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] up to automatically enter work date in the **Date Received** field when you select the **Payment Made** check box.

### To have the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page filled automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Automatically Fill Date Received** check box.
3. Open the **Register Customer Payments** page and proceed to process incoming customer payments using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. Learn more about date formulas at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

# Managing VAT Rate Changes

VAT rates can change depending on local legislation. Any change in VAT impacts your data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] whether or not the VAT rate is lowered, raised, or removed. VAT is connected to many entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers, vendors, items, resources, item charges, and general ledger accounts. Changes in VAT rates usually happen at a specific date, from which point you will need to have changed the VAT setup, posting groups etc. to make sure new sales orders and purchase orders are created with the new VAT rate.

## Changing VAT rates

The optimal approach to manage a VAT rate change is to fully post and close open orders and other documents before the VAT rate switch date, to make sure these are not impacted by the change. This is the cleanest approach that allows you to start up new orders and documents with the new VAT rate.

The following approach is suggested to manage a VAT rate change

1. Fully post and close open orders, journals and other documents before the switch date. You can wait to after the switch date as long as you do not add new lines and make sure the effective date will be prior the switch date.  
2. Create the new VAT setup.  
3. Make the VAT switch on entities (relevant customers, vendors, items, and so on).  
4. At the VAT rate switch date you create new documents that will use the new rate.  


> [!NOTE]  
> We are currently updating the VAT Rate Change tool. The functionality mentioned below may not match the functionality in your environment. The update will take place before July 1st 2020 and will not be a regular monthly update. Instead, all environments will be updated automatically (hotfix). When this update is complete, this message will no longer appear.  

## The VAT Rate Change tool

The VAT Rate Change tool can assist with conversion of VAT Rates on master data, journals and orders, to some extent. This is useful if you want to convert VAT on master data more easily or if you have orders that you cannot close before the switch date and will be processed over a longer period of time, crossing the VAT rate switch date. There are certain restrictions and limitations in the VAT Rate Change tool that applies.

## Understanding the VAT rate conversion process and limitations

The VAT Rate Change tool performs VAT rate conversions for master data, journals, and orders in different ways. The selected master data and journals will be updated by the new general product posting group or VAT product post group. If an order has been fully or partially shipped, the shipped items will keep the current general product posting group or VAT product posting group. A new order line will be created for the unshipped items and updated to align current and new VAT or general product posting groups. In addition, item charge assignments, configuration templates for items, reservations, and item tracking information will be updated accordingly. 

On order lines, the unit price will be updated for all lines of type Item and Resource, if using prices incl. VAT for the item. For other line types it is possible to decide whether or not the unit price should be updated.

There are a few things that the tool does not convert:

* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments have been posted. These documents are posted using the current VAT rate.  
* Documents that have posted prepayment invoices. For example, you have made or received prepayments on invoices that have not been completed before you use the VAT rate change tool. In this case, there will be a difference between the VAT that is due and the VAT that has been paid in the prepayments when the invoice is completed. The VAT rate change tool will skip these documents and you will have to manually update them.  
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they are partially shipped or received.  
* Drop shipments.
* Special orders. 
* Assembly orders.
* Service contracts.  
* Credit memos.
* Return orders.
* Prices on Items (master data)
* Prices on Sales Prices (master data)
* Business Posting Groups on Customers and Vendors.

### To prepare VAT rate change conversions

Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, you must make the following preparations.

* If you have transactions that use different rates, then they must be separated into different groups either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
* If you create new general ledger accounts, then you must create new general posting groups.  
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible and reduce unposted documents to a minimum.  
* Back up data.

### To set up the VAT rate change tool

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Master Data**, **Journals**, and **Documents** FastTabs, choose a posting group value from the option list for needed fields.

### To perform VAT rate change conversion

You use the VAT rate change tool to manage changes in the standard rate of VAT. You perform VAT and general posting group conversions to change VAT rates and maintain accurate VAT reporting. Depending on your setup, the following changes are made:  

* VAT and general posting groups are converted.  
* Changes are implemented in general ledger accounts, customers, vendors, open documents, journal lines, and so on.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you perform VAT rate change conversion, you can test the conversion. To do so, follow the steps below, but make sure to clear the **Perform Conversion** and **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** check boxes. During test conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is cleared and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is blank. After the conversion is complete, choose **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** to view the results of the test conversion. Verify each entry before you perform the conversion. In particular, verify transactions that use an old VAT rate.

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in basic warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In a basic warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* Production, select **Inventory Pick/Movement** in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Assembly, select **Inventory Movement** in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Project management, select **Inventory Pick** in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field.

Use the following documents for internal operations:

* Inventory pick
* Inventory movement

## Inventory picks

* When you register an inventory pick for an internal operation, such as production or a project, the consumption of the picked components is posted at the same time.

* The **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page is optional.
* When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line or project planning lines defines the *take* bin. Components are decreased in the take bin when you post consumption.

## Inventory movements

* Inventory movements require that you turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page for the location.
* Inventory movements only work with production order component lines and assembly order lines.
* When you register an inventory movement for an internal operation, you only record the physical movement of the components to a bin in the operation area. You don't post consumption.
* When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area. The place bin is where warehouse employees must place the components.
* Register the consumption of the picked components separately by posting a consumption journal or assembly order.

### Production

Use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins, you can extend the flow to production by using **Inventory Movement** documents. Inventory movements are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from the To-Production or Open Shop Floor Bins, go to [Flushing Production Components in a Basic Warehouse Configuration](#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

#### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

### Assembly  

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Movement** documents require bins.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Project management  

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For locations that use bins, you can extend the flow to project with **Inventory Movement** documents.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line when it creates inventory picks. To use inventory picks for projects, you must turn on the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on the **Project Card** page for the projects. This setting lets you track usage against your plan. If you don't turn on the toggle, the remaining quantity stays at **0** and the inventory pick isn't created. To learn more, go to [To set up project usage tracking](projects-how-setup-jobs.md?tabs=current-experience#to-set-up-project-usage-tracking).

## Pick or move for production, assembly, and projects in a basic warehouse configuration

You can create an inventory pick or inventory movement in three ways:  

* From the source document itself.  
* For several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* In two steps. Release the source document to make the source document ready for picking. Create the inventory pick or movement from the **Inventory Pick** or **Inventory Movement** documents. The inventory pick or movement are based on the source document.  

### To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create an inventory movement from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order, assembly order, or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Movement** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create multiple inventory picks or movements with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you might create picks only for productions orders.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, turn on the **Create Invt. Pick** or **Create Invt. Movement** toggles.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create inventory picks or movements in two steps

To pick or move components for source documents in two steps, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|On the **Planned Production Order** page, change the status of an order to **Released**, or use the **Released Production Order** page to create a released production order.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status of an assembly order to **Released**.|
|Projects | Change a project's status to **Open**, or create project with status Open right away.|  

A warehouse employee assigned to picking items can create an inventory put-away document for the source document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks** or **Inventory Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document that the put-away is for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking assembly components.
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick or movement lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory pick

1. On the **Inventory Pick** page, open the document to record a pick for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin where the items must be picked from the bin where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the pick quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Post the consumption of the source document lines that were picked.
* If the location uses bins, posting creates warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record a movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin to pick from is suggested based on the item's default bin and availability. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the move, and then enter the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries now indicate that the components are in the bins specified on the source document order lines. For example, the assembly order, production component, or project planning line.

>[!NOTE]
> Unlike when you move components with inventory picks, consumption isn't posted when you register an inventory movement. You register consumption as a separate step by posting the source document.

## Flushing production components in a basic warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the flushing method you select, you can pick components for production in the following ways:

* Use an **Inventory Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. When you register an inventory pick, the consumption of the picked components is posted.
* Use an **Inventory Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Manual** flushing method. You must register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal, and other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps provide an example of the actions that different people take and the related responses:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action on the production order and turns on the **Create Invt. Pick** and **Create Invt. Movement** toggles. An inventory pick document is created for items with **Manual** flushing method, and an inventory movement is created for items with **Pick + Backward** and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods.
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks and movements to a warehouse employee.
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the inventory movement. The bin can be a work center or machine center bin.  
5. The warehouse employee posts the pick. The quantity is deducted from the bins.
6. The warehouse employee posts the movement. The quantity is deducted from the pick bins and added to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.  
7. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.  
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

 The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.

# Restructure Warehouses
You may want to restructure your warehouse with new bin codes and new bin characteristics. You will not undertake this kind of activity very often, but situations can occur where a reclassification is necessary to achieve or maintain a more efficient operation. For example:  

- You might want to switch to bin codes that support the use of automatic data capture, for example, with hand-held devices.  
- The warehouse may have purchased a new rack system that gives new possibilities in item storage.  
- The company may have altered its item assortment and moved the warehouse to a new physical location to accommodate this change.  

If your warehouse is set up to use bins but not directed put-away and pick, restructure your warehouse by creating the new bins that you want to use in the future.  

## To restructure a basic warehouse that uses bins only  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Default Bin Selection** field to **Last-Used Bin**.  
3.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you have just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select a journal line, and then choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
    3.  On the **Bin Content** FastTab, set filters in the **Location Code**, **Bin Code**, and **Item No.** fields to specify the content that you want to move.  
    4.  Choose the **OK** button to fill a journal line.  
    5.  In the **New Bin Code** field, select the bin to which the items should be moved.  
    6.  Repeat steps b through e for all bin content that you want to move.  
    7.  Choose the **Post** action.  

You have now emptied the bins where the items used to be. The default bins for your items have now been changed to the new bins.  

## To restructure an advanced warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick  

1.  Create the new bins that you want to use in the future. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  
2.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  For the bins where no real movement of items is involved, create a line for each of your current bins in the **Warehouse Reclassification Journal** with the old bin code, **From Bin Code**, and the new bin code, **To Bin Code**.  
    3.  If some of the movements involve actual physical movements that you want employees to perform, use **Movement Worksheets** to prepare movement instructions instead of using the warehouse reclassification journal. For more information, see [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

3.  When the old bins are emptied, reclassify them as **QC** type bins to ensure that they are not included in item flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the line with the location, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
    3.  On the **Bins** page, in the **Bin Type Code** field, enter **QC** for each of the old bins that you emptied in step 3 in the previous procedure.  

You have now removed the bins from the warehouse flow, and reclassified them as QC bins. QC bins have none of the activity fields on the **Bin Types** page selected and are therefore not considered by the item flow. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## To delete a bin  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to delete bins. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the lines for the bins that you want to delete.  
4.  Choose the **Delete** action.  

If you choose the **Yes** button, the bin is deleted for use in the future, but the bin code in all warehouse entries remains the same.  

If you want to rename a bin so that all records associated with the bin are also renamed, including bin contents, warehouse activity lines, registered warehouse activity lines, warehouse worksheet lines, warehouse receipt lines, posted warehouse receipt lines, warehouse shipment lines, posted warehouse shipment lines, and warehouse entries, you can do so on the **Bins** page.  

## To rename a bin and change the bin code in all records  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to rename a bin or change the bin code, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the bin that you want to change and enter a new bin code in the **Code** field.  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you choose **Yes** and there are many entries concerning this bin, for example, because you have not deleted warehouse documents for some time, it may take some time to rename all the records. Therefore, if you use this method, consider running the batch job **Delete Registered Whse. Documents** before you start the renaming process. Also note that the only documents that are deleted in this batch job are put-aways, picks, and movements.  
>   
>  If you are renaming a receiving bin or a shipping bin, all the posted receipts or shipments that refer to the bin in question are renamed.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line on the **Approval User Setup** page, and then fill the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User ID**|Select the user ID of the person involved in the approval process.|
   |**Salespers./Purch. Code**|Specify the salesperson or purchaser code that applies to the user.<br /><br /> You typically fill in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field if the salesperson or purchaser responsible for the customer or vendor is also the person who must approve a sales or purchase request.|
   |**Approver ID**|Select the user ID of the person who must approve requests made by the person you specified in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Sales Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum sales amount in local currency (LCY) that the person selected in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Sales Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all sales requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Sales Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Purchase Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum purchase amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Purchase Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Purchase Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Request Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve for purchase quotes.<br /><br /> To use this field, you must select the **Approver Chain** option in the **Approver Limit Type** field on the **Workflow Response** page.|
   |**Unlimited Request Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase quotes regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Request Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Substitute**|Select the user ID of the person who will approve requests made by the person identified in the **User ID** field if the user in the **Approver ID** isn't available. <br /><br />**Note:**  The substitute can either be the user in the **Substitute** field, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).|
   |**Email**|Specify the email address of the person in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Approval Administrator**|Specify the user who has permission to unblock approval workflow, such as by delegating approval requests to new substitute approvers or deleting overdue approval requests.<br /><br />**Note** Only one person can be the approval administrator.|

3. To test the approval user setup, choose the **Approval User Setup Test** action.  
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every person you want to set up as an approval user.  

The next step is to specify how you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to notify people that a request is pending their attention. Learn more at [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

# Change which features are displayed

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is designed to help you run your business regardless of the size and complexity. At the core of the product, you find essential features, such as financial reporting, sales, purchasing, and inventory management. As business complexity increases, you can turn on functionality for manufacturing and service management, for example.

You can define the product complexity level, and thereby which features the company's users get access to, by changing the **Experience** setting on the **Company Information** page. Note that the experience setting can also be changed by adding certain extensions from AppSource. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|
| **Premium** |Shows all actions and fields for all business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management.|

The experiences that can be selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reflect the solution licenses, called plans, that are defined for the product. For information about the Essential and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264940) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 marketing site. See also the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264939).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Users of type Team Member, Internal Admin, External Accountant, and Delegated Admin can be assigned a different plan than other users in the solution. Only users of type Evaluation or Premium can change the value in the **Experience** field from Essential to Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, a user with the Premium plan can sign in to a company that's using the Essentials plan. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. The same isn't true in the opposite direction. Users who have the Essentials plan can't sign in to a company that's using the Premium plan.

Prior to defining a company's experience setting, you define users' access to specific functions and pages by assigning permission sets. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The **Experience** setting applies to all users in a company, but each user can personalize their own experience further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Enabling premium features after upgrading a plan

Users are assigned to plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center in connection with the general work to create the Business Central users. For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To update plan changes in users groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

When you have made a change to users plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center, such as assigned more users to the Premium plan, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change.

1. Sign is as an administrator.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Users** page, choose the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action.

### To select the Premium experience

You can now proceed to select the new experience.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Information** page, on the **User Experience** FastTab, select Premium  in the **Experience** field.

## Help assumes the Premium experience

All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements.

# Sales Quick Start

To be able to sell products and services, you must first set up items and customers. Once that is done, you can start registering sales orders and sending out invoices.

## Set up items to sell

This video shows how to set up an item to sell in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

### Set up a new item

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up items, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

## Set up customers

This video shows how to set up a new customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<br>

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

### Set up a new customer

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up customers, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md)

## Create a sales order  

When you sell something to a customer, you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a sales invoice. However, if your sales process is more complex, for example if you have situations where you only ship parts of an order quantity, you use a sales order.

### To create a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product.

9. To add a comment about the order line that the customer can see on the printed sales order, write a comment in the **Description** field on an empty line.

10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item that you want to sell to the customer.

11. To only ship a part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value is copied to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

12. To only invoice a part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

13. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales orders, see [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## Create a sales invoice

When you create and post a sales invoice, you not only create the invoice document you send to the customer, you also create the related quantity and value entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### To create and post a sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 20.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select **New** to create a new entry.

3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.  

8. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

9. Repeat steps 5 through 8 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.  

10. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

11. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales invoices, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md)

# Set Up Multiple Interest Rates for Delayed Payment

You can use different interest rates for different periods for delayed payments in trade transactions. [!INCLUDE [multiple-interest-rates-def](includes/multiple-interest-rates-def.md)]

For example, a government specifies the maximum interest to be levied for a consumer. This interest rate can be changed twice a year on 01 January and 01 July. The interest rate between businesses (B2B) is agreed by the parties and there is no limit to that customer group. The announced rate is usually four percent more than the normal bank interest.

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.  

## To set up multiple interest rates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Finance Charge Terms** page, select the required finance term, and then choose the **Interest Rates** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the required reminder term, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
7. On the **Reminder Levels** page, for the relevant reminder levels, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  

When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.

# Update currency exchange rates

If you trade in different currencies, you need to keep track of the changes in currency exchange rates. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you manage and update the exchange rates manually or automatically and set up a currency exchange rate service.

## Currencies

> [!TIP]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find real-time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates under the term currency. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-def](includes/finance-currencies-def.md)]

You can specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code. For more information, see [Currencies](finance-set-up-currencies.md#curr)

### Example of a receivable currency transaction

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-example](includes/finance-currencies-example.md)]

## Exchange rates

The exchange rates are the tool to calculate the local currency value (LCY) of each currency transaction. The **Currency Exchange Rates** page includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Starting Date**|The date when the currency rate was effective.|  
|**Currency Code**|The currency code related to this exchange rate.|  
|**Relational Currency Code**|If this currency is part of a triangular currency calculation, then you can set up the related currency code here.|  
|**Exchange Rate Amount**|The exchange rate amount is the rate for the currency code selected on the line. Normally 1 or 100.|  
|**Relational Exch. Rate Amount**|The relational exchange rate amount relates to the rate to use for the relational currency code.|  
|**Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Fix Exchange Rate Amount**|Specifies if the currency's exchange rate can be changed on invoices and journal lines.|  

In general, the values of the **Exchange Rate Amount** and **Relational Exchange Rate Amount** fields are used as the default currency rate on all new receivables and payables documents that are created going forward. The document is assigned the currency rate according to the current working date.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Exchange Rate Amount * Relational Exch. Rate Amount`

The adjustment exchange rate amount, or the relational adjustment exchange rate amount, updates all open bank, receivables, or payables transactions.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount * Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt`

## Adjust exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, you need to adjust other currency equivalents periodically. If you don't, amounts you converted from foreign (or other) currencies and posted to the general ledger in local currency can be incorrect. Also, you need to update daily entries posted before you enter a daily exchange rate.

You can use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job to manually adjust the exchange rates for posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. The batch job can also update other reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use a service to update exchange rates automatically. For more information, see [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service). However, this doesn't adjust exchange rates on already posted transactions. To update exchange rates on posted entries, use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.

You can also specify how the adjustment handles dimensions for unrealized gains and losses postings by choosing one of the following options in the **Dimension Posting** field:  

* **Source Entry Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values for G/L entries for unrealized gains and losses from the entry you're adjusting.  
* **No Dimensions**: Don't transfer dimension values for unrealized gains and losses to G/L entries. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still uses default dimension settings, for example, **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**. If the source transaction entries have dimension values, the adjustment creates entries without dimension values.  
* **G/L Account Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values from the unrealized gains and losses G/L account's dimension settings source entry to G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the preview capability, you need to turn on the **Feature Update: Enable use of new extensible exchange rate adjustment, including posting review** feature on the **[Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610)** page.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available in the Swiss version right now, but it's coming soon. We're working on it.

## Preview the effect of an adjustment

You can preview the effect that an exchange rate adjustment has on posting before you actually post by choosing the **Preview Posting** action on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report (Report 596) request page. On the request page, you can specify what to include in the preview:

* Get a detailed posting to the general ledger by entry.
* Get a summarized posting by currency. Just pick the **Adjust per entry** field on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report.

### Effect on customers and vendors

For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job uses the exchange rate that was valid on the posting date specified for the batch job to adjust the currency. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealized Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there's an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry. The new entry reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### Dimensions on customer and vendor ledger entries

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the dimensions from the customer or vendor ledger entries to the adjustment entries, and posts adjustments for each combination of dimension values.

### Effect on bank accounts

For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realized Gains Acc.** field or the **Realized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### Dimensions on bank account entries

The adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and the gain/loss account are assigned the bank account's default dimensions.

### Effect on G/L accounts

If you post in another reporting currency, the batch job can create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between the local currency and the other reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry. It adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

#### Dimensions on G/L account entries

The adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they're posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, you need to enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=e871f958-fe42-4cf3-bb8a-e97f4c7658de]

## Set up a currency exchange rate service

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> Most exchange rate services provide data that is compatible with the import process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, sometimes the data is formatted differently and you need to customize your import process. You can use the data exchange framework to do that by adding your own codeunit. You'll probably need some help from a developer to do that. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **New** action.
3. On the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Map the fields from the XML file to the currency exchange rates table in the source field.
5. Apply any necessary transformation rules.
6. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to enable the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The following video shows how you can connect to a currency exchange rate service, using the European Central Bank as an example. In the segment that describes how to set up field mappings, the setting in the **Source** column for the **Parent Node for Currency Code**  only returns the first currency found. The setting should be `/gesmes:Envelope/Code/Code/Code`.

<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=76914b80-c36a-4d74-95fa-0cdf5c5c0bfa]

## Update currency exchange rates through a service

Follow the steps given to update the currency exchange rates through a service:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

## Correct mistakes

Every now and then you might need to correct a mistake in a payment transaction that's associated with adjustments to foreign currency gains and losses. You can use the **Reverse transaction** action on the **Bank Account Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages to unapply and reverse the payment transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> When you unapply and reverse a payment for an entry that had currency exchange rate adjustments associated with it, the reversal posts reversal entries for the adjustments. You might have to run the currency exchange rate adjustment again to get the correct current balance.

# Service Order Status and Repair Status

The **Status** field on the **Service Order** page and the service item repair status, which is represented by the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Order** page have a certain relationship in Service Management. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Allocated Hours (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Allocated Hours** report gives an overview of the allocated time, in hours, for each work center. The view of allocated hours can help you identify over and underused work centers. Additionally, the report includes indicators such as the load percentage, allocated time (hours), and capacity available (hours) for a quick summary of resource use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Allocated Hours Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png":::

## Use the report

Manufacturing managers use the report to plan and allocate resources effectively. The data shows which work centers are over or underutilized, so you can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

For example, if you notice that a work center is underused, you can assign more work orders to that center to optimize the use of its resources. Conversely, if a work center is over utilized, you can reallocate work orders or consider adding more resources to that work center.

Manufacturing workers use this report to optimize the use of resources. You can analyze the allocated time in hours of each work center, and then plan your work accordingly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Allocated Hours* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order Capacity Need
- Work Center
- Work Center Group

# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

> [!TIP]
> For a graphical view of the most-used keyboard shortcuts, select the following image, and download the PDF file.
>
> [![Icon for the PDF file.](media/keyboard_shortcut_inline.png)](media/keyboard-shortcuts-2024.pdf "Icon that opens a PDF")

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

| Select these keys<br>(these keys in macOS) | To do this |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Show access keys for selecting actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu of the page. Learn more in the [Access keys for action bar and navigation menu](#access-keys-for-action-bar-and-navigation-menu) section. |

| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> | Copy the value of a field. If the field is in focus, and specific text in the field isn't selected, the entire value is copied. If any text in the field is selected, only that text is copied. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open either the [help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane) or a Business Central help article on [Microsoft Learn](/dynamics365/business-central/), depending on your Business Central version. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> | Switch between wide and narrow layout views. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> | Reload the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application. (The effect is similar to the effect of selecting the **Refresh** or **Reload** button in the browser.)|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+select | Navigate during personalization or customization when the action is highlighted with an arrowhead. Learn more in [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open the **Help & Support** page. Learn more in [Help & Support page](product-help-and-support.md#help--support-page). |

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

## Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab
 |Symbol/Icon|Description|  
 |------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Black cross|Orders (both supply and demand).<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Red circle|Existing supply orders that are not in planning suggestions.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Yellow star|Forecast demand.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Forecast Name** field has a value.<br /><br /> When both the **Show Projected Inventory** and the **Include Planning Suggestions** fields are selected, then each yellow star has a linked counterpart in the opposite graph. This illustrates how a suggested supply fulfills the forecasted demand.|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a red cross|Suggested supply order with action message *Cancel*.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a star|Suggested supply orders with action message *New*.<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has one or two arrows|Suggested supply orders with action message *Reschedule*, *Change Qty.*, or *Resched. and Chg. Qty.*<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).<br /><br /> The arrows reflect the direction of the planning suggestion. For example, a left arrow together with an up arrow reflects a *Resched. and Chg. Qty.* action message that consists of a backward rescheduling and a quantity increase.|  
-->
<!--When you access the drop-down menu for the **Timeline** FastTab, the following functions appear depending what you choose  

 |Function|Description|  
 |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element on the point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab.<br /><br /> Any filter values that are defined in the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab will be applied to the new supply order. **Note:**  If the filter fields are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply order is created by using the following codes: <ul><li>If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.</li><li>If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created by using the first filter value according to the sorting order.</li></ul> If you want another variant or location code in the new supply order, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
 |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it creates zero inventory before the next supply.|  
 |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted. **Note:**  You can only delete a supply of action message type *New*. After you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  
 |**Show Document**|Opens the order, planning line, or forecast that the element represents.|  
 |**Zoom Out (Ctrl++)**|Makes the scale of the x-axis larger, so that fewer days are shown. **Note:**  You can also do this by pressing Ctrl + scroll mouse wheel.|  
 |**Zoom In (Ctrl+-)**|Makes the scale of the x-axis smaller, so that more days are shown. **Note:**  You can also do this by pressing Ctrl + scroll mouse wheel.|  
 |**Reset Zoom (Ctrl+0)**|Reverts the scale of the x-axis to what was used before you zoomed.|  
-->
<!--In addition to the keyboard actions that were mentioned earlier, you can also use the following keyboard actions in the **TimeLine** FastTab.  

 |Keyboard Action|Description|  
 |---------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Ctrl + scroll mouse wheel|Changes the scale of the x-axis.|  
 |Select an element, then press Shift+Arrow|Moves the element in the direction of the arrow stroke.|  
 |Tab|Moves to the next element.|

# Copilot in Business Central overview

This article answers common questions about Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## What is Copilot in Business Central?

Copilot is the AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. Copilot in Business Central is the world's first AI-powered assistant across all lines of business. With Copilot in Business Central, small and medium-sized organizations empower their workers through intuitive AI tools that boost creativity and save time.

## Where can I find the list of Copilot features in Business Central?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Learn more in [Work smarter with Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://aka.ms/BCAI).

## How does Copilot approach security, privacy, and compliance?

Copilot is built on the Microsoft cloud and designed for enterprise use, with the security, privacy, and compliance controls that our customers expect. Here's some key points to common questions:

- When a user interacts with Copilot, it inherits their data permissions and can't read any more data than the user already has access to.
- Microsoft doesn't read your prompts or use your data to train AI models without your explicit permission.
- For customers within the EU Data Boundary, data doesn't move outside that boundary. 

Learn more about Copilot data security and privacy in Dynamics 365 at [FAQ for Copilot data security and privacy for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/faqs-copilot-data-security-privacy) and data movement across geographies in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

## How does Copilot approach AI safety?

Generative AI within Copilot in Business Central aligns with Microsoft's responsible AI principles, including fairness, reliability, safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Learn more in [Responsible AI FAQs for Business Central](responsible-ai-overview.md) or explore our [Responsible AI transparency report](https://aka.ms/RAITransparencyReport2024).

## Is Copilot free?

Currently, Copilot in Business Central is included with your Business Central license at no extra cost. However, fair-use policies, quotas, or pricing might be introduced later.

## Does Copilot in Business Central require a minimum number of users?

Currently, no minimum number of users is required to start to use Copilot in Business Central.

## How does Copilot use the Azure AI time quota that is included with licenses?

Business Central offers numerous AI-powered features. Some features, such as sales and inventory forecasting, use specific machine learning models. These features rely on Azure AI and aren't related to Copilot. As the Dynamics 365 licensing guide indicates, 30 minutes of Azure AI time are included with Business Central licenses. This quota refers to non-Copilot features, where consumption of Azure AI time has no effect on Copilot in Business Central.

## Is Copilot in Business Central available worldwide?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Each Copilot capability defines its own list of supported regions and supported languages. Although most features might be available only in English at first, we aim to unlock more languages and regions over time. Learn more at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).

## Is Copilot aware of my environment customizations?

Some but not all Copilot features can work with your custom pages, tables, and other content from the apps that you have installed. For example, you can use [analysis assist](analysis-assist.md) on your custom lists, or you can use [chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md) to find records in custom tables. Learn more about how each Copilot feature works with your customizations in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md) and [Chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md).

The accuracy and user experience of Business Central’s AI-powered features might vary based on the apps that you have installed.

## Does Copilot have to be trained on my data?

Copilot in Business Central relies on powerful AI foundation models that are coupled with data management features of the Business Central platform. No expensive or time-consuming training is needed before your organization can start to use Copilot with your own company data.

## Can I develop my own copilots for Business Central?

## Is there a difference between Copilot in Business Central and Copilot for Microsoft 365?

Microsoft empowers people to achieve more through copilots that are adapted to different situations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is the AI assistant that is intended for working with Microsoft Teams, Excel, and other productivity apps. Copilot in Business Central is the AI assistant that is intended specifically for the Business Central app.

## Does Copilot in Business Central work with Copilot for Microsoft 365?

Currently, there's no direct connection between Copilot in Business Central and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Meaning, Copilot features inside Business Central are unaware of your Microsoft 365 data.

Conversely, when working in the Microsoft 365 suite of applications there are options for Copilot to utilize Business Central data. One such option is Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance, a standalone product that utilizes general GPT training data, Microsoft 365 Graph data, and ERP information. Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance can connect to Business Central and work with ERP data useful to specific contexts and scenarios, like collections management.

Learn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance with Business Central in [Collect outstanding balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md). Learn more general information at [Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-finance).

## Is Copilot available for Business Central online only?

Yes, Copilot is exclusive to Business Central online. Therefore, it isn't available for other deployment types, such as on-premises or private cloud.

## Is Copilot available to Embed applications?

Currently, because of technical limitations, we can't offer Copilot to customers who run independent software vendor (ISV) Embed apps. ISVs can extend Copilot with their own functionality or provide alternative uses of generative AI.

# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimized for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent checks before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).

# Convert Existing Locations to Warehouse Locations
You can enable an existing inventory location to use zones and bins and to operate as a warehouse location.  

The batch job to enable a location for warehouse operation creates initial warehouse entries for the warehouse adjustment bin for all items that have inventory in the location. These initial entries will be balanced when warehouse physical inventory entries are entered after the batch job is run.  

You can create zones and bins either before or after the conversion. The only bin that you must create before the conversion is the one that is to be used as the future adjustment bin.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To clear all negative inventory and any open warehouse documents before you convert the location for warehouse handling, run a report to identify the items with negative inventory and open warehouse documents for the location. For more information, see Check on Negative Inventory.  

## To enable an existing location to operate as a warehouse location  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Warehouse Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Code** field, specify the location that you want to enable for warehouse processing.  
3.  In the **Adjustment Bin Code** field, specify the bin at the location where unsynchronized warehouse entries are stored. For more information, see the [To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).  

    Using the open item ledger entries for the specified location, warehouse journal lines are created that sum up every combination of Item No., Variant Code, Unit of Measure Code, and, if necessary, Lot No. and Serial No. in the item ledger entries. The warehouse journal lines are then posted. This posting creates warehouse entries that place the inventory in the warehouse adjustment bin. The **Adjustment Bin Code** on the location card is also set.  

4.  To see which items were added to the adjustment bin during the batch job, run the **Warehouse Adjustment Bin** report.  
5.  When the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job has completed, perform and post a warehouse physical inventory. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  It is recommended that you run the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job at a time when it will not impact the daily work in the system. This job processes each entry in the **Item Ledger Entry** table, and if there are a large number of item ledger entries, the job can last several hours.  

 For those locations that did not use warehouse management documents before the conversion, you must re-open and release any source documents that were partially received or partially shipped before the conversion.

# Set up e-documents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The E-Documents core module is a framework. By default, there's no **Service Integration** field. If you find the **Document Format** options by default, remember that they're offered as examples. Localization apps must provide format detail because they're specific to local requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> A standard PEPPOL document format is a global format in the **Document Format** field. Keep in mind that you probably can't use this format as is. It's a W1 format that Microsoft provides to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use this format.

The first step to configure electronic documents (e-documents) is to set up the E-Documents Service for e-document communication.

## Set up an e-document service

To set up an e-document service, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **E-Document Service** page, on the **General** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Code | Select the electronic export setup code. |
    | Description | Enter a brief description of the electronic export setup. |
    | Document Format | The export format of the electronic export setup. By default, there are two options in this field. You can select **PEPPOL BIS 3** as a generic code-based format or **Data Exchange** when you must set up predocuments of specific formats on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab.</p> |
    | Service Integration | Select the integration code for the electronic export setup. Currently, the only option is **No integration**. |

3. On the **Importing** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Automatic Import | Specify whether documents should be automatically imported from the service. |
    | Automatic processing| Specify whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses your e-document setup to automatically create a purchase document based on the received e-document. If you choose **No**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the e-document, but you must review its details before you create the purchase document. |
    | Validate Receiving Company | Specify whether the receiving company information must be validated during import. |
    | Resolve Unit Of Measure | Specify whether to resolve the unit of measure during import. |
    | Lookup Item Reference | Specify whether to search for items by item reference during import. |
    | Lookup Item GTIN | Specify whether to search for items by Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) during import. |
    | Lookup Account Mapping | Specify whether to search for accounts in **Account Mapping** by the incoming text during import. |
    | Validate Line Discount | Specify whether to validate a line discount during import. |
    | Apply Invoice Discount | Specify whether to apply an invoice discount during import. |
    | Verify Totals | Specify whether to verify invoice totals during import. |
    | Create Journal Lines | Specify whether a journal line must be created instead of a purchase document. Select this option when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Template Name | Specify the name of the general journal template that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Batch Name | Specify the name of the general journal batch that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | Batch Start Time | Specify the start time for import jobs. |
    | Minutes between runs | Specify the number of minutes between import job runs. |

4. If you selected **Data Exchange** in the **Document Format** field on the **General** FastTab, on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Document Type | Specify the document type that uses data exchange to import and export the data. Examples include **Sales Invoice**, **Sales Credit memo**, and **Purchase Invoice**. |
    | Import Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to import the data. Use this field only to receive a document in the purchase process. |
    | Export Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to export the data. Use this field only to deliver documents in the sales process. |

> [!NOTE]
> There are data exchange definitions for the PEPPOL format that are related to sales and purchase documents. However, you likely can't use these definitions as is. They're all W1 formats that are provided to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use them.
>
> If you configured the **Data Exchange Definition** format in your localization, you can add a line for the document types that you need. Add lines that match the default data exchange example for the W1 PEPPOL format. However, first select the **Document Type** option for each line that you need. For each data type, select the **Import Data Exchange Def. Code** or **Export Data Exchange Def. Code** value that you want to use.
>
> If you don't use the **Data Exchange Definition** format, you can create and configure formats by using the [interface](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extend-edocuments). Adjust the information on the **Export Mapping** and **Import Mapping** lines, where you can find the tables and fields to configure transformation rules. In this case, you must add a new option for your format in the **Document Format** field.  

5. On the **Exporting** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table:

   |Field  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   | Batch Exporting | Specify whether the service uses batch processing to export e-documents. |
   | Embed document PDF to export| Specify whether to embed a PDF version of the e-document in the e-document file when you export.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Embed document PDF to export** option can make life a little easier. When you post a document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a PDF file and embeds it as a PDF attachment in the e-document. The PDF is a human-readable version that's easier to understand than the full XML of the PEPPOL format.

### Supported document types

Support for document types is based on the **Document Format**. To check which document types are supported, on the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Supported Document Types** action. The **E-Document Service Supported Source Document Types** opens. In the **Source Document Type** column, you can choose different document types for the format you're planning to use. Only use the document type if that document is selected.

## Set up a document sending profile

You can set up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each customer. If you do, you don't have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you can set up sending profiles and then select the one to use in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** checkbox to specify that a document sending profile is the profile for all customers for which a profile isn't specified in the **Document Sending Profile** field.

This feature is used to set up electronic invoicing automation. When you choose **Post and Send** on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog shows the sending profile in use. It's either the profile set up for the customer or the default profile for all customers.

To set up a document sending profile, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Sending Profile**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the required fields.
4. On the **Sending Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Electronic Document | Specify whether the document is sent as an e-document that the customer can import into their system when you select **Post and Send**. To use this option, you must also set the **Format** or **Electronic Document Service Flow Code** field. Alternatively, you can save the file to your computer. |
    | Format | Specify the format to use to send an e-document. This field is required if you select **Through Document Exchange** in the **Electronic Document** field. |
    | Electronic Document Service Flow Code | Specify the electronic service flow that's used to send documents. This field is required if you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field, you must already have the workflow configured for your e-documents.

## Set up the workflow

To set up a workflow for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow Templates**, and then select the related link.
2. If you can't find **E-Document Workflow Templates** on the **Workflow Templates** page, select **Reset Microsoft Templates**. **E-Document Workflow Templates** should then appear. Close the page.
3. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, and then select the related link.
4. Choose the **New Workflow from Template** action to select a template for the e-documents process. The available templates are **Send to one service** and **Send to multiple services**.
5. Select **OK** to finish the workflow setup.
6. In the **Then Response** field, select **Send E-Document using setup** to configure the workflow responses.
7. Select the E-Document Service that you created as an option, choose **OK**, and then enable the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create your own workflow for e-documents without using predefined workflow templates. If you have more services, you can use different workflows.

To use more workflows, configure them through the document sending profiles for different customers. When you set up the workflow, specify the document sending profile in the **On Condition** column on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, because you can't have two services that use the same document sending profile in workflows.

When you configure your workflow on the **Workflows** page, point to the **On Condition** field on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab. On the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Filter** field, select the document sending profile that you want to use.

## Set up a retention policy for e-documents

E-documents can be subject to local legislation that specifies the period for which you must keep e-documents. To manage that, administrators can define retention policies that control how often [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes records. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

To set up retention policies for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Retention Policy** action.
2. When the action is completed, select one of the following retention policies to set up:

    - E-Document Log
    - E-Document Integration Log
    - E-Document Mapping Log
    - E-Document Data Storage

## E-Documents demo data  

> [!NOTE]
> From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 24.0, you can set up demo data for E-Documents.

To provide easier ways to test and demonstrate e-documents, Microsoft offers a demo module. To enable the module, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contoso Demo Tool**, and then select the related link.  
2. Before you enable the **E-Document Contoso Module**, you must first enable the  **Common Module** and **Warehouse Module**.
3. After you enable the modules, select the **E-Documents Contoso Module**, and then choose the **Generate** action.
4. Follow the steps.  
5. Close the page.

After you enable the module, you have demo items, six electronic documents (based on Peppol BIS 3), and configured **E-Document Services** with created workflows.

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Allocate recurring costs and income

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several accounts when you post the journal. To learn more about recurring general journals, go to [Work with recurring journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).

The following allocation methods are available:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features work with recurring general journals and in fixed asset journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following procedures describe how to prepare to allocate costs in a recurring general journal by defining allocation keys. When allocation keys are defined, you complete and post the journal like any other recurring general journal. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Allocation Accounts** aren't supported in recurring journals. While the **Allocation Account** option is available in the **Account Type** field on the lines of the journal, this option isn't supported. Instead, use the allocations feature as described in this article.
>
> If you defined allocation accounts in a previous version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], update the setup to use allocations.

## To set up allocation keys

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be a quantity, percentage, or amount.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you're done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you're allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that is already set up

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose the **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose **OK**.

# Sustainability value chain setup

To use the sustainability value chain features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Sustainability setup  

You need to specify some settings for the sustainability value chain functionality, such as enabling the value chain features to work with sustainability features, and the areas you'll use and track.  

To configure these settings, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields related to the sustainability value chain. The following table describes the fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable sustainability value entries posting through the value chain operations, and the availability of these fields in operational documents and journals. If you don't enable this field, sustainability features aren't available on operational documents, orders, or journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **G/L Account Card** page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **Item Charge** page.</br></br> **Important:** This field isn't currently supported. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that selecting the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field doesn't activate the sustainability value chain features. The field only enables you to record emissions in purchase documents. If you want to use purchase documents in value chain operations, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Item Charge** functionality currently isn't supported in the sustainability value chain process. We plan to add this feature in 2025 release wave 2.  

## Emission fees  

To use the sustainability value chain features, you must configure carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The value chain works only for CO2e, and not each type of greenhouse gas (GHG). You set up CO2e on the **Emission Fees** page.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the GHG emission you want to configure. This field is mandatory.
3. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** field specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential (GWP). If the **Emission Type** is **CO2**, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always **1**. You can't change this value because CO2 is the reference gas used to calculate the GWP of other greenhouse gases. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to **1**. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following example shows how to calculate the carbon equivalent factor. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to enter is 0.00336.  

To learn how track internal carbon fees or use other features related to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), go to [Set up sustainability in Business Central](finance-sustainability-setup.md).

# Add marketing text to items

For any item registered in Business Central, you can write *marketing text* about the item. Although marketing text is a kind of description, it's different than an item's **Description** field. The **Description** field is typically used as a concise display name to quickly identify the product. The marketing text, on the other hand, is a more rich and descriptive text. Its purpose is to add marketing and promotional content, also known as *copy*. This text can then be published with the item if it's published on a web shop, like Shopify, or pasted into emails or other communications with your customers.

There are two ways to create the marketing text. The easiest way to get started is to use Copilot, which suggests AI-generated text for you. The other way is to start from scratch. 

## <a name=copilot></a>Get marketing text suggestions with Copilot

With Copilot, you quickly get a text suggestion that's automatically generated for you. The AI-generated text is tailored to the item and provides a good starting point. The text is based in part on the following information:

- Attributes defined for the item&mdash;for example, the description, color, dimensions, material, and so on. Learn more about item attributes in [Work with item attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).
- The item’s **Description** field.
- The item category. [Learn more about categorizing items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).
- Selectable style preferences like tone of voice, format, and length.

Copilot is designed to save you time and help you write creative and engaging text that reflects your brand and is consistent across your product line. Start by generating a suggestion, then change the suggested text as needed.

### Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

### Prerequisites

- The **Marketing text suggestions** capability is activated by an administrator. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

### Create first draft with Copilot

Complete the following steps to add marketing text to an existing item. Learn how to create a new item in [Register new items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

1. In Business Central, open the item that you want to modify by completing the following steps:

   - In the upper-right corner, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 22.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link to show a list of available items.

   - Double-click the item or select its value in the **No.** column.

1. From the item card, there are two ways to get started writing marketing text with Copilot: from the **Marketing Text** FactBox or using the **Marketing text** action. These methods are indicated in the following figure of an item card.  

   [![Shows an item card with Marketing Text pane](media/create-with-copilot.svg)](media/create-with-copilot.svg#lightbox)

   To create the first draft for an item, do one of the following steps:

   - In the **Marketing Text** pane in the FactBox on the right side of the page, select **Draft with Copilot**. 

     Copilot starts to draft the marketing text.

   - At the top of the page, select the **Marketing Text** action, then select **Draft with Copilot** on the **Edit Marketing Text** window.  The **Draft Marketing Text with Copilot** windows appears and lists all available attributes for the item.
1. Select the attributes you want Copilot base suggestions on, then select **Generate**. You can change the selected attributes and other options later. Copilot starts to draft the marketing text. 

   ![Shows the edit marketing text window](media/marketing-text-copilot-attributes.svg)

1. When Copilot completes the draft, the text appears in the Copilot editor window for you to review and edit.

   [![Shows the create with Copilot windows](media/create-with-copilot-window.svg)](media/create-with-copilot-window.svg#lightbox)

   You can now get more suggestions, try to improve the suggestions you get, edit text, and more. Go to [Review, edit, and save](#review-edit-and-save-text) for details.

### Review, edit, and save text

Once you have the first draft, you must review it and make changes to the text to get it ready for publishing. This work is done from the Copilot editor, which lets you get more suggestions, change preferences to influence the suggestions, and manually make changes and style the text.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AI-generated text from Copilot is only a suggestion and it can have mistakes. It requires human oversight and review to ensure it's accurate and appropriate. Review any suggested text and edit as needed before you save and publish it for public consumption.

Use the following guidelines to finalize and save the marketing text.

1. Make changes to text directly in the text box. Use the tool bar along the bottom of the box to format and style text, add links, and more.
2. To get a new suggestion, select **Regenerate**.
3. If you're not satisfied with the suggestions, enhance the text suggestions using the **Tone**, **Format**, and **Emphasis** preference options.

   <!--Select **More Settings**, change the options that are shown under **Choose how Copilot creates suggestions**, then select **Create draft** to get a new suggestion.-->

   For guidelines on improving suggestions, go to the [Improve and tailor text suggestions](#improve-and-tailor-text-suggestions).

4. To go back and forth through suggestions, use the previous and next links at the top of the page (*x* **of** *y*). <!-- or select the **...** (More formatting options) along the bottom of the window, then select **Undo**. Select **Redo** to go back.-->
5. Carefully review the text for accuracy and appropriateness:

   - If you want to save the text, select **Keep it**. 
   - If you don't want to save, select the discard button (trash can) ![Shows the trash can icon for deleting all Copilot proposal for bank account reconciliation](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png).

### Improve and tailor text suggestions

There are a few steps you can do to improve the text suggestions and tweak them to suit your personal or company's preferences.

1. Change the item attributes used by Copilot.

   Copilot suggestions are based, in part, on the attributes assigned to the item. To view the available attributes and current settings, select the edit ![Shows the edit icon on the Copilot window for changing attributes](media/edit-pencil.png) icon in the upper-left corner. In the **Item Attributes** page, choose the attributes that best align with the characteristics that you want to promote. The more relevant attributes you include, the richer the outcome becomes. If you feel you're missing some key attributes, add more. For more information about attributes, go to [Work with item attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md)
1. Change your preference settings for  **Tone**, **Format**, and **Emphasis** options.

   |Option|Description|
   |-|-|
   |Tone |Use this option to influence what kind of words, phrases, and punctuation are used to engage the target audience. You can choose from several predefined tones of voice, ranging from **Formal** (which results in a business tone) to **Creative** (which results in an informal tone). |
   |Format and length|Use this option to control the general structure of the text, which consists of three parts, covered by four different options: <ul><li>**Tagline** - A catchy phrase or short sentence that identifies the item or brand.</li><li>**Paragraph** - A single paragraph of fluent and verbose text, consisting of several complete sentences.</li><li>**Tagline + Paragraph** - A tagline followed by a paragraph</li><li>**Brief** - An introductory sentence, similar to a tagline, followed by a bulleted list of key points of interest.</li></ul> |
   |Emphasis|Use this option to choose from a list of predefined qualities that you want to emphasize in the text. Choose a quality that best aligns with the type of item you're writing about. The qualities don't directly correspond to the item's attributes, description, or category. For example, **Quality** could be a good choice for both a bike or desk, while **Speed** would suit a bike, but not a desk.|

1. Improve the **Description** field on the item card.

   The text in the **Description** field is used as-is in many places in the suggested text, so it's important that the description best portrays how you want the item referenced in the marketing text. 

1. Make sure the **Item Category Code** field on the item card is set to a proper category.

   Copilot finds words and phrases that are related to the category and work them into the suggested text.

### Working with multiple languages 

Text is always generated in the language defined by your user [settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language). If your organization operates and enters data into Business Central using a different language, or if Business Central is connected to your online store such as with Shopify, this might result in publishing content that doesn't match similar marketing content.

## Create text from scratch

1. In Business Central, open the item that you want to modify as follows:

    1. In the upper-right corner, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 22.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link to show a list of available items.
    2. To open the item, double-click it or select its number in the  **No.** field.

2. Do one of the following steps:

   - In the **Marketing Text** pane of the FactBox on the right side of the page, select **Edit**.
   - Select the **Marketing Text** action.
3. Make changes to text directly in the **Marketing Text** box. Use the tool bar along the bottom of the box to format and style text, add links, and more.
4. Select **OK** when done to save the text.

# The Microsoft Pay extension

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective February 8 2020, changes in the Microsoft Pay service will affect the Microsoft Pay extension in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. Due to the changes, after February 8, the **Pay now** payment links that the Microsoft Pay extension generates for invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not open Microsoft Pay. Customers who are using the extension should change their Payment Services setup to start using the PayPal extension instead.<br /></br>
>
> From January 8, we will display a notification in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The notification will contain a link to the settings that you need to change and to more information. After February 8, the Microsoft Pay extension will no longer be available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].<br /></br>
>
> The changes impact the following versions of Business Central:
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central October 2018
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central April 2019
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central 2019 Release Wave 2

Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of the quality of product but also in terms of delivery and payment services. The Microsoft Pay service helps you increase your customer service.

The Microsoft Pay extension adds a Microsoft Pay link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using Microsoft Pay. Then you can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customers' payments to arrive on your bank account.

The Microsoft Pay extension provides the following benefits:
- Customer payments appear faster on your bank account.
- Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
- Microsoft Pay offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on unknown web sites.
- Microsoft Pay offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, such as PayPal and Stripe.
- The Microsoft Pay link can be embedded automatically on every invoice document or by the user.
- Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Connect to Power BI from Business Central on-premises

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must be enabled for Power BI integration. This task is typically done by an administrator. For more information about enabling Power BI integration with Business Central online, see [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](admin-powerbi-setup.md).

Some features are only available with Business Central online, not on-premises. Learn more in [Introduction to Business Central and Power BI](admin-powerbi.md#get-ready-to-use-power-bi)

## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication.

1. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

   Enable OData web service on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] and open the OData port in the firewall. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

   The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

1. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

   A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. Learn more in [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

1. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

   To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, register an application for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. Learn more in [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

1. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

   Before users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator must give consent to the Power BI service.

   To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action leads you through the consent process and checks your Power BI license. When you're prompted, sign in using a Microsoft Entra admin account. Learn more in [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).

## Build Power BI reports displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your Dynamics 365 Business Central data available as a data source in Power BI Desktop and build powerful reports of the state of your business.

Use Power BI Desktop to create reports that display Dynamics 365 Business Central data. After creating reports, you can publish them to your Power BI service or share them with all users in your organization. Once these reports are in the Power BI service, users set up for it can view the reports in  Business Central.

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multitenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A user name and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you need a user name and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization might have specific account for this purpose.

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.
1. Sign-in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

   If you're not signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from Power BI desktop before, you're prompted to sign in.

   For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and select **OK**. When prompted, enter the user name and password for the account for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. Select **Connect** when done.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you aren't prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

1. Once connected, Power BI contacts the Business Central service. The **Navigator** windows appears and displays available data sources for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and see the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all the web services and API pages published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The data sources are grouped by Business Central environments and companies.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.

1. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
1. To add more Business Central data later, repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, view it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and can begin building your Power BI report.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about Power BI Desktop in [Get started with Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-getting-started).

## Manage and modify reports

> [!NOTE]
> You can't manage and modify reports.

## Upload reports

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, there are no demo reports available, so you have to start from scratch by using Power BI Desktop. Alternatively, Power BI reports can be distributed as files that you can upload directly from Power BI online service. Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

# Design Details: Item Tracking in the Warehouse
Serial number and lot number handling is primarily a warehouse task and therefore all inbound and outbound warehouse documents have standard functionality for assigning and selecting item tracking numbers.  

However, because the reservation system is based on item ledger entries, warehouse activity documents that register only warehouse entries are not fully supported. Because reservations and item tracking numbers can be handled only at the location level, not at the bin and zone level, the **Item Tracking Lines** page cannot be opened from warehouse activity documents. The same applies to the **Reservation** page.  

After a serial or lot number has been added to an item at a warehouse location, it can be moved and reclassified freely within the warehouse by using an independent item tracking structure that is unrelated to the reservation system. **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are accessed directly on warehouse document lines. When the serial or lot number later partakes in outbound posting, it is synchronized with the reservation system as a part of ordinary bin adjustment. For more information, see [Design Details: Integration with Inventory](design-details-integration-with-inventory.md).  

However, the reservation system does take warehouse activities into consideration when it calculates availability. For example, items that are allocated to picks, or registered as picked, cannot be reserved. For more information, see [Design Details: Warehouse Availability](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

# Design Details: Variance
Variance is defined as the difference between the actual cost and the standard cost, as described in the following formula.  

 actual cost – standard cost = variance  

 If the actual cost changes, for example, because you post an item charge on a later date, then the variance is updated accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Revaluation does not affect the variance calculation, because revaluation only changes the inventory value.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how variance is calculated for purchased items. It is based on the following scenario:  

1.  The user purchases an item at LCY 90.00, but the standard cost is LCY 100.00. Accordingly, the purchase variance is LCY –10.00.  
2.  LCY 10.00 is credited to the purchase variance account.  
3.  The user posts an item charge of LCY 20.00. Accordingly, the actual cost is increased to LCY 110.00, and the value of the purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
4.  LCY 20.00 is debited to the purchase variance account. Accordingly, the net purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
5.  The user revalues the item from LCY 100.00 to LCY 70.00. This does not affect the variance calculation, only the inventory value.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

 ![Purchase variance calculation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_11_purchase_variance.png "Purchase variance calculation")  

## Determining the Standard Cost  
 The standard cost is used when calculating variance and the amount to capitalize. Since the standard cost can be changed over time because of manual update calculation, you need a point in time when the standard cost is fixed for variance calculation. This point is when the inventory increase is invoiced. For produced or assembled items, the point when standard cost is determined is when the cost is adjusted.  

 The following table shows how different cost shares are calculated for produced and assembled items when you use the Calculate Standard Cost function.  

|Cost Share|Purchased Item|Produced/Assembled Item|  
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis)

## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# Design Details: Planning Assignment Table
All items should be planned for, however, there is no reason to calculate a plan for an item unless there has been a change in the demand or supply pattern since the last time a plan was calculated.  

If the user has entered a new sales order or changed an existing one, there is reason to recalculate the plan. Other reasons include a change in forecast or the desired safety stock quantity. Changing a bill of material by adding or removing a component would most likely indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

For multiple locations, the assignment takes place at the level of item per location combination. If, for example, a sales order has been created at only one location, application will assign the item at that specific location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If no change in an item’s demand-supply pattern has occurred, the planning system will not suggest any actions to be taken. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items in order to find out what to plan for, and that would drain system resources.  

The **Planning Assignment** table monitors demand and supply events and assigns the appropriate items for planning. The following events are monitored:  

* A new sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Change of item, quantity, location, variant, or date on a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Cancellation of a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Consumption of items other than planned.  
* Output of items other than planned.  
* Unplanned changes in inventory.  

For these direct supply-demand displacements, the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message.  

The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance:  

* Change of status to Certified in the production BOM header (for all items using that header).  
* Deleted line (child item).  
* Change of status to Certified in the routing header (for all items using that routing).  
* Changes in the following item card fields.  
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time.  
* Lead Time Calculation.  
* Reorder Point.  
* Production BOM No. (and all children of old BOM reference).  
* Routing No.  
* Reordering Policy.  

In these cases, a new function, Planning Assignment Management, maintains the table and states the planning reason as Net Change.  

The following changes do not cause a planning assignment:  

* Calendars  
* Other planning parameters on the item card  

When calculating an MPS or an MRP, the following restrictions apply:  

* MPS: The planning system checks that the item carries a demand forecast or a sales order. If not, the item is not included in the plan.  
* MRP: If the planning system detects that the item is being replenished by an MPS planning line or MPS supply order, the item will be left out of the planning. However, any demand from relevant components is included.

# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. For more information about permission settings, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. For more information about customize page layouts, see [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for very specific users, you can set the **Description** field to `Navigation menu only.`. This way, the profile is excluded from the list of available roles in **My Settings**.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one. Copy one that has similar settings to the one you want to create.

When you copy a profile, all the involved page customizations are copied as well, both the user-created and those derived from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't visible to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and back in.

> [!Caution]
> Do not rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in as users may experience that the product freezes and must be restarted.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. For more information about user settings, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. For more information about role explorer, see [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles are exported to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. For more information about exporting profiles, see [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from Business Central. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Import Profiles** wizard.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a user group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, then they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they are using.<!--Deleting changes can be useful, for example, if an employee changes role and no longer needs them. The profile defines the page layout and deletions restore it back to that definition.--> 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user sees the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. For more information, see [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization can't be used. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all the pages that are personalized and the user that they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user will see the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. For more information, see [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. For more information, see [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. For more information, see [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).

# Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox

The intercompany transactions that you receive from your partners are listed on the **Intercompany Inbox** page. To learn how to process incoming intercompany transactions, go to [Process incoming intercompany transactions](#process-incoming-intercompany-transactions). The intercompany transactions that you send to partners are listed on the **Intercompany Outbox** page. To learn how to process outgoing intercompany transactions, go to [To process outgoing intercompany transactions](#to-process-outgoing-intercompany-transactions).

However, depending on your intercompany setup, some transactions are automatically handled. You can set up the source company and partner companies to automatically create documents and journals that correspond to transactions that partners post through the intercompany general journal. To learn about using intercompany journals, go to [Fill in and post an intercompany journal](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md#fill-in-and-post-an-intercompany-journal).  

## Organizing the Inbox  

You can use the filter fields at the top of the Inbox page to determine which transactions are shown on the page. For example, if you only want to explore transactions that a particular partner created, use the **Transaction Source** and **Intercompany Partner Code** filters.  

### Transaction source  

What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was:  

* Created by your intercompany partner  
* Rejected by your intercompany partner and returned to you  

Use the **Show Transaction Source** field to filter the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page so that it displays only one of these types of transactions. You can also filter by intercompany partner, or by the contents of the **Line Action** field.  

#### Created by intercompany partner  

 When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner, you can choose to either:

* Accept the transaction  
* Reject the transaction (return to partner)  
* Cancel the transaction (delete the transaction and don't return it to your partner)  

#### Returned from intercompany partner  

If your intercompany partner rejects a transaction, you must cancel the transaction in the inbox and then create correction lines or reverse the journal or document.  

## Recreating inbox entries  

If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

## Get an overview of intercompany transactions for a period  

You can get an overview of all of the intercompany transactions that you have sent and received in a period. The **Intercompany Transactions** report lists all intercompany G/L entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the intercompany partners are in the same database, the partners can automatically accept transactions. The go directly to the **Handled Intercompany Inbox Transactions** and **Handled Intercompany Outbox Transactions** pages. To learn more about auto-accepting transactions, go to [Auto-accept transactions from intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).  
>
> * For the synchronization partner, on the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle.
> * For partner companies, on the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto. Accept Transactions** toggle.  

## Import intercompany transactions from a file

[!INCLUDE [onprem_only_md](includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company, you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file. Then you must import the transactions into your inbox.  

1. Save the file to the location that you specified in the **Intercompany Inbox Details** field when you set up intercompany.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, choose the **Import Transaction File** action.  
4. on the page that appears, select the .xml file that contains the transactions, and then choose the **Open** button.  

The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them.

## Process incoming intercompany transactions (using the inbox) 

When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions, the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox. You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act on it.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Accept**, to process the line.
3. On the **Complete IC Inbox Action** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

For lines that you accept, document or journal lines are created in your company. Open each document or journal, make any necessary changes, and then post them.  

Lines that you reject and return to your partner go to your intercompany outbox, where you can send them to your partner.

For lines that a partner rejected and returned to you, you must post a correction to the original transaction that you posted in your company.

## To process outgoing intercompany transactions (using the outbox) 

When you post an intercompany journal or document, or send an intercompany order confirmation, the transactions go to your intercompany outbox. To send them to your intercompany partners, open the outbox and process them.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Outbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Return to Inbox**, to process the line.

Use the **Send to Intercompany Partner** action to send lines to the relevant partner's inbox.

Use the **Return to Inbox** action to move lines to your inbox, where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company.  

If you use the **Cancel** action, you must post a correction to the transaction that you originally posted in your company.  

## Recreate intercompany inbox or outbox transactions  

You might want to re-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox. For example, if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

The following procedure describes to re-create inbox transactions, but the same steps also apply to the outbox.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Handled IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Handled IC Inbox Transactions** page, select the line with the transaction that you want to re-create in the inbox, and then choose the **Re-create Inbox Transaction** action.

# The Service Declaration Extension

In some EU countries/regions, authorities require that businesses report the export of services to other EU countries/regions. The **Service Declaration** extension lets you collect information about service trade in the EU and report it to the authorities. Although its name is **Service Declaration**, you can also use it as **Intrastat for Services**. This extension is available for all EU countries/regions as a W1 version, and it can be used as-is in Belgium. For other countries/regions, an extension based on the country/region is required. If a country/region only needs a different format, you can use the report configuration in the **Data Exchange Framework** to change the format.

## Enable the Service Declaration extension

After you install the extension in your environment, you need to enable it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set up an IRS 1096 feature**, and then choose the related link.
2. Follow steps in the assisted setup guide. The most of fields are configured by default.
3. Add only **Service Transaction Types** in the second step by choosing the **Open the service transaction types page to specify the list of codes** option.
4. Before you start, check the **Total number of codes** to understand how many service transaction types are already specified.
5. Choose **Finish** in the last step to finish the configuration.

## Set up the Service Declaration extension

You can set up the extension manually, or by using a reporting file on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page.

### To set up Service Declaration manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the fields described in the following table:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Declaration No. Series**     | Specifies the number series to use to assign IDs to new records.        |
    |**Report Item Charges**  | Specifies whether item charges must be reported. If enabled, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the service transaction code for item charges and includes them in service declarations.        |
    |**Sell-To/Bill-To Customer No.**     | Specifies the customer to use to compare their country code with the country code on the **Company Information** page. Only documents where these two codes are different are included in the service declaration.<br><br>* **Bill-To.**: Use the country code from the **Bill-to Customer** <br<br>* **Sell-To.**: Use the country code from the **Sell-to Customer**.        |
    |**Buy-From/Pay-To Vendor No.**  | Specifies which vendor to use to compare their country code with the country code from the **Company Information** page. Only documents where these two codes are different are included in the service declaration.<br><br> * **Buy-From.**: Use the country code from the **Buy-From Vendor**. <br><br> * **Pay-To.**: Use the country code from the **Pay-To Vendor**.         |
    |**Data Exch. Def. Code**  | Specifies the data exchange definition code used to generate the exported file for the service declaration.        |
    |**Enable Tax Registration No.**     |  Specifies whether the **Tax Registration No.** is enabled for the service declaration.       |

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Transaction Types**, and then choose the related link.
4. On the lines, specify **Codes** and **Descriptions** for the service transaction types you use.

### Set up a reporting file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, describe the data exchange definition by specifying the data file type, column separator, related codeunits, XMLport, and filling in the other fields.
4. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, describe the formatting of lines in the data file by filling the fields based on the **Line Type** field and where you need to define the number of columns for this line.
5. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column.
6. Choose the **Field Mapping** action on the **Line Definitions** FastTab to open the **Field Mapping** page.
7. Create a new entry, and on the **General** FastTab, choose the **Table ID** (for **Service Declaration Line**, choose **5024**), and then fill in the fields as follows:
   1. In the **Key Index** field, specify the key index to sort the source records by before exporting.
   2. Select the **Mapping Codeunit**.
8. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, add the columns you previously configured in the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and then add the following:
   1. Specify the **Field ID** for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** for each column as needed. The rule transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, and vice versa.
9. To group entries based on columns, choose the fields to use for grouping on the **Field Grouping** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with a preconfigured data exchange definition for **Service Declaration** for all localized countries/regioins. Learn more about creating a new data exchange definition at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

## Other related configurations

Before using the Service Declaration extension, configure some fields for items, resources, and item charges.

### Items

Set up information related to Service Declaration on Item Card pages:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the item you want to configure.
3. Expand the **Item** FastTab, and configure the following fields:
   1. In the **Type** field, choose **Service**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource you want to configure.
3. Expand the **General** FastTab, and configure the following fields:
   1. In the **Service Transaction Type Code** field, specify the code for a **Service transaction type**.
   2. If you don’t want to include this resource in service declarations, choose the **Exclude From Service Declaration** field.

### Item Charges

Set up information related to Service Declaration for item charges:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Charges**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the item charge you want to configure.
3. In the **Service Transaction Type Code** field, specify the code for a **Service transaction type**.
4. If you don’t want to include this item charge in service declarations, select the **Exclude From Service Declaration** field.

## Create new service declaration

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declarations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Config. Code** field, specify the configuration code that is used to suggest lines and create files. You need to choose one as a **Service Declaration**.
    2. In the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, specify the start and end dates of the period to include in the service declaration.
4. Choose the **Suggest lines** action to start a batch job that collects lines from documents and fills in the service declaration lines.

The batch job retrieves all entries from applicable purchase and sales documents in the required period and adds them on the service declaration lines. Hover over fields in lines to read a short description.

## Modify a service declaration

If needed, you can modify the lines or add new ones.

1. On the **Service Declaration** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. In the **Document Type** field, choose the option related to the document you want to use.
3. Based on the **Document Type**, fill in the **Document No.** field.
4. Fill in the remaining fields.

## Overview the service declaration lines

After you create a service declaration, use the **Overview** action to get an overview of the service declaration lines. You can group and summarize the lines in the same way as the exported file. You can also open the lines in Excel.

## Report Service Declaration in a file

You can submit the service declaration as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declarations**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service declaration you want to report as a file.
3. Fill in the service declaration manually, or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The service declaration file is saved in the required format.

## Other considerations

When you're using the **Service Declaration** extension, there are a few more things to consider. For example, it's important that your groups match requirements from authorities. It's also important that services are included correctly on sales and purchase documents.

### Grouping lines

On service declaration lines, there's no grouping by any field. All entries are copied from the original document as a source.

Grouping required by authorities is provided in the exported file. You must configure the groups in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Using services in document lines

When you create a purchase, sales, or service  invoice, there are two fields related to service declarations on their lines. Both fields are filled in with the default values from your item, resource, or item charge set ups.

- **Service Transaction Type Code** - Specifies the code for a service transaction type.
- **Applicable For Service Declaration** - Specifies whether an item or resource is applicable for a service declaration.

You can change the values in these fields, but if you select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you must specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field. If you don't, you can't post the document.

If you specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field but don’t select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you can post the document, but the line isn't calculated.

# Settle purchase invoices promptly

If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can post the payment when you post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, check, or bank transfer, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice. For more information, see [Defining Payment Methods](finance-payment-methods.md).  

## To settle purchase invoices promptly

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must contact a Microsoft partner who can add the fields through code.  
>
> This customization is only required if you do not specify balancing accounts on the payment methods as describe above.

# Use the same Microsoft 365 Account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] and Microsoft Invoicing
When you sign up for a trial with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can move to a 30-day evaluation phase, you can start a subscription, or you can stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In all cases, you may at some point have seen something called **Microsoft Invoicing** and clicked it. This was an app that was part of what is now Microsoft 365 Business Standard and was formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, so not everyone will have seen that tile in their Microsoft 365 experience.  

Microsoft Invoicing is no longer available, but if you need to sign into Invoicing to retrieve your data, you might see a message that you cannot access Microsoft Invoicing because your account is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You see a similar message if you install the mobile app for Invoicing.  

## Workaround
Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a shared platform. That means that you are recognized as an existing user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you click Invoicing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The reason is that Invoicing cannot use the same company as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

So you will have to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rename your existing company, and then create a new company that you can then use in Invoicing. No data is moved or overwritten during this workaround.

### To rename your company
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
2. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
3. In the **Company** field, choose a different company.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
5. On the **Companies** page, choose **Edit List**.  
6. Change the name of the *My Company* entry to something else.  

    Wait a number of minutes. We’ll be making a number of changes in the underlying database, and that takes a while.
7.	When the system is ready again, choose the **Create New Company** button.  
8.  In the dialog that appears, specify the name as *My Company*, and choose the **Production – Setup Data Only** option.  

This again takes a number of minutes. When the process completes, you will be able to access Invoicing as part of your Microsoft 365 Business Standard experience. but only to export data since the Invoicing app is deprecated.  

### What about my data?
When you rename the original My Company, the database tables that store your existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data are renamed, but the data itself is not touched.  

If you use both Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the data is stored in two different containers (the two companies). Nothing is shared, so you'll have to manage customers and items in both companies.

# Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Stock**, the sales order process assumes that the item is already assembled and can be picked from inventory if it's available. Therefore, an assembly order isn't automatically created and linked to the sales order line. However, if some or all of the quantity isn't available, you can create an assembly order for the remaining quantity. To do that, fill in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line. This setting lets you assemble the item to order although it's set up to be assembled to stock.  

You have similar flexibility when you sell assemble-to-order items and some of the quantity is already in inventory. You'll want to deduct that quantity from the assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure doesn't include the sales order steps that you need to follow before you create an assembly order for unavailable quantities.

## To sell assemble-to-order items and inventory items together

1. On a sales order line for an assemble-to-stock item, enter a quantity in the **Quantity** field that exceeds inventory. The **Check Availability** page appears. To learn more about item availability, go to [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).
2. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the value from the **Total Quantity** field.  
3. Make any changes needed to the assembly components. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  
4. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about the standard assembly steps, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it is, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Use time sheets

This article describes how to use time sheets to track absence, and to track time and resources that are spent on a project. Tracking time helps you identify issues early and avoid delays or cost overruns. Time sheets make it easy for a resource to report time usage for an individual or a machine so that managers can review the usage and its allocation.

You can copy and use your project planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct. To learn more, go to [To copy project planning lines to a time sheet](#copy-project-planning-lines-to-a-time-sheet).

After you approve time sheet entries for a project, you can post them to the relevant project journal or resource journal. To learn more, go to [To post time sheet lines in a project journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-project-journal) and [To post time sheet lines in a resource journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-resource-journal).

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. To learn more about setting up time sheets, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use time sheets on a mobile device. To do that, you might have to turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** toggle on the [Resources Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=462) page.

## Create time sheets

You can use the **Create Time Sheets** page to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. Then, the time sheet owner can open it and record time that has been spent on a task. You can also [schedule the batch job to run automatically](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permissions to create time sheets. To learn more about permissions, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the **Create Time Sheets** action on the **Resources** list page and the **Resource Card** page.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Before you create time sheets for a resource, make sure that the **Use Time Sheet** and **Time Sheet Owner User ID** fields are specified for them on the **Resource Card** page.

    Optionally, choose the **Schedule** action to specify how often to automatically run the task. For example, to configure the task to run weekly for four weeks, on the **Schedule a Report - Create Time Sheets** page, in the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter **4W**. To learn more about how to schedule reports, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

You can view the time sheets that you create on the **Time Sheets** page. Each time sheet consists of one or more lines that define the time that you want to submit for approval. The following table describes the types of lines that you can add to the time sheet.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| | Use to add a note or marker in the **Description** field of the time sheet line. For example, you can use this field to categorize time sheet entries. If you leave the **Type** field empty for a time sheet line, you can't enter time values in the weekday fields for that line. |
| Absence | Use to register the time you're absent during a work week. To complete the information for the line, specify the type of absence in the **Cause of Absence Code** field. |
| Assembly Order | Used to register time for assembly orders. A time sheet line of this type is created while posting assembly order lines for which the resource is set up to use time sheets. You can't manually select a line of this type. |
| Project | Use to register time usage for a project. To complete the information for the line, specify the project number and the project task number for which you want to register time. You can register time for lines that you haven't scheduled.|
| Resource | Use to register time usage for a resource. To complete the information for the line, provide a description of the work. |
| Service | Use to register time usage for a service order or service credit memo. |

For example, you want to submit a time sheet for a week where you did cleaning tasks and had a day off for a medical appointment. The following table shows how you would add lines to the time sheet.

| Type | Description | Work Type Code | Absence Type Code |
|--|--|--|--|
| Resource | Work hours | Cleaning |  |
| Absence | Time off |  | Health |
|  | I had to take off Tuesday due to a medical appointment. |  |  |

In this hypothetical example, you can then register the hours across the relevant days for each weekday.  

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, your company will have predefined work types for the various types of lines. In those cases, you just choose the relevant work type from the list, and then you add your own description.  
>
> Choose the work type by choosing the :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Description** field, by choosing the **Activity Details** action and then specifying it in the page that opens, or by choosing it in the **Work Type Code** field or the **Absence Type Code** field, respectively. In this case, you can ignore the [To define work types and add one to a time sheet](#define-work-types-and-add-one-to-a-time-sheet) section.  

## Reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets

If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, copy the lines from the previous time period to save time. Then, just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.  
3. Choose the **Copy Lines from Previous Time Sheet** action.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a project, the **Project No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can now modify the lines as needed.

## Copy project planning lines to a time sheet

The following procedure describes how to quickly add project planning lines to a time sheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Time Sheets** page, select a time sheet for the relevant time period.  
3. Choose the **Create lines from project planning** action. Any project planning lines in the time sheet time period are copied to the time sheet for the person or machine in the **Resource No.** field on the time sheet.

## Define work types and add one to a time sheet

You can define the work type for all-time sheet lines for service orders, project orders, and resources. In this way, you can add information that you need to bill the customer for different types of work.  

1. On the **Time Sheets** page, choose the relevant time sheet.
2. On the first of the lines in the **Lines** section, choose the **Type** field, and then choose the relevant type, such as *Resource*.  
3. Choose the **Description** field, and then, in the **Time Sheet Line Resource Detail** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
    1. If no work types exist, choose the **New** action.
    2. On the **Work Types** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then return to the time sheet.
4. Fill in the rest of the time sheet. For more information, see the [To fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval](#fill-in-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval) section.  

> [!TIP]
> You can follow similar steps to define absence codes.

## Fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval

Time sheet registration is tracked in hours, the standard base unit of measure for resources. By default, a time sheet shows the common work days of Monday through Friday.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a time sheet for the relevant period.
3. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary. Enter the number of hours used by the resource on each day of the week.  

    In most cases, to track work, you add a line of type *Resource*, and then register hours spent each day. If you want to register absence, add a line of type *Absence*.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can review the sum of time sheet hours entered in the **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBox.  
4. Repeat step 3 for other work types that the resource performs.  

    Next, decide whether to submit all, or selected, lines on the time sheet.  

    * To submit the time sheet for one or more lines, choose the relevant line, and then choose the **Submit** action.

        On the submission page, choose the **Selected lines only** option. The state of the line changes from **Open** to **Submitted**.
    * To submit the time sheet for all open lines, choose the **Submit** action at the top of the **Time Sheet** page.  

        Confirm that you want to submit all open lines on the current time sheet.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only submit time sheet lines for which you have entered time.  
5. To modify information on a line that has been set to **Submitted**, select the line, and then choose the **Reopen** action.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A manager might reject a time sheet line that is submitted for approval. If a line has the status **Rejected**, you can make changes to the line, and then choose **Submit** again.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

## Approve or reject a time sheet

A time sheet must be submitted for approval before it can be used. You can approve and reject individual lines on a time sheet or send them back to the submitter. You approve a time sheet in two ways:

* A time sheet administrator can approve any time sheet.
* The person who is specified in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on a resource card can approve that resource's time sheets. To learn more about setting up approval, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a time sheet from the list.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page: 
    1. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Approve** action.
    2. Choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Reject** action and follow steps 4 through 5.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Time Sheet Status** and **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBoxes to get an overview of time sheet information.

After you approve or reject a time sheet, it can't be modified unless it's first reopened. The following procedure explains how to reopen an approved or rejected time sheet.

## Reopen a time sheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets** or **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a time sheet from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only reopen lines with the status **Approved**. You can't reopen lines with the status **Rejected** or that are posted.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page, choose the **Reopen** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to reopen all lines, or the **Selected lines only** action to reopen only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The status of the time sheets line or lines is changes to **Submitted**.  

## View and approve time sheets by project

On a project, you can specify a person who is responsible for the project. That information is linked to time sheet lines. The link gives project managers a list of the time sheets to approve. For example, the team's project manager might be responsible for certain projects in your company. In that case, the manager should be designated as the **Person Responsible** on the Project Card page. This view of time sheet information shows the project tasks associated with a project and the quantity of hours used.

> [!NOTE]
> To approve time sheets on the **Manager Time Sheet by Project** page, you must first select a **Time Sheet by Project Approval** option in the **Resources Setup** page. To learn how to set up approvals for resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).

### Approve or reject a time sheet by project

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Manager Time Sheet by Project**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a list of time sheet lines associated with the projects for which you're responsible.
2. Choose the **Approve** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only approve time sheets with the status of **Submitted**.

3. To provide additional information about the approval or rejection, select the **Related** action, then **Comments**, and then **Line Comments**.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]
> After you approve or reject a time sheet line by project, you can't reopen or modify it on the **Time Sheet** page.

## Post time sheet lines in a resource journal

# Use item references

If you buy or sell items that you and your vendor or customer use different terms for, then you can set up a reference between your terms for the items and the terms that the customer or vendor of that item uses. This way, the vendor's or customer's item description, unit of measure, or variant code is automatically inserted on the relevant documents when you fill in the **Item Reference No.** field.  

## To set up an item reference

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to create a reference.
3. Choose the **Item References** action.

     If you can't find the **Item References** action, choose to view more options, and then find it under **Related** > **Item**.
  
4. On a new line on the **Item Reference Entries** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

The following procedure describes how you specify the item reference on a purchase order. Similar steps apply to sales documents and other purchase documents.  

## To enter a vendor's item description on a document

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase order for the vendor that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
3. Create a purchase line for the item that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
4. In the item reference **No.** field, select the relevant item reference, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Description** field on the line is overwritten with the vendor's item description, as set up on the item reference entry. If the item reference includes a variant code or a unit of measure, these values are also copied to the document.  

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

The following table lists the pages that support barcode scanning of item references from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

|Page  |Field value you can scan  |
|---------|---------|
|Item Reference     | Reference No.        |
|Item Journal Line     | Item Reference No.        |
|Phys. Invt. Order Line     |Item Reference No.         |
|Purchase Line     |   Item Reference No.      |
|Sales Line     | Item Reference No.        |

# Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central license that allows them to view, modify and act on their business data from any user interface. For all other employees across the organization that only need to occasionally view data, Business Central offers access through Microsoft 365.  

When an organization has both a Dynamics 365 Business Central and Microsoft 365 subscription, administrators can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, and choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. When configured, employees that have a Microsoft 365 license but no [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license can view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.

## Why enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses  

- Unlock master data that every employee across the organization should have access to.

- Empower departments that don’t run on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to self-serve, by accessing key data needed to successfully perform their tasks, eliminating the need for continually requesting data from others.

- Increase collaboration efficacy so that tasks and projects that span across departments complete on time, by eliminating the friction that is typically associated with access denied errors due to licensing.

- Increase team performance so that people can make data-driven decisions that are inclusive of everyone in the group, even if they don’t work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Meet licensing budget targets by assigning licenses that progressively match employee needs, with Microsoft 365 licenses for read-only access, Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member licenses for limited write access, and Dynamics 365 Business Central Essentials or Premium for full write access.

- Improve data security by reducing the need for pasting screen snippets of business data outside of data governance boundaries.

## Use rights

When a person accesses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a Microsoft 365 license, the license entitles the user to read (but not write) [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data through a simplified user interface in Microsoft Teams. This section explains these use rights and limitations that help you plan how to configure and make the most out of this capability. For more information on this license type compared to other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses, consult the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
 
### Client access

Users are entitled to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Microsoft Teams. The following table summarizes which of the different methods of accessing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service are allowed with this license.

|Client accessing the Business Central service |Access|
|-|-|
|Business Central app for Microsoft Teams|![Yes](media/check.png)|
|Business Central Web client |![No](media/x-icon.png ) |
|Business Central mobile apps|![No](media/x-icon.png )|
|Business Central APIs|![No](media/x-icon.png )|
|Business Central integrations with other Office applications|![No](media/x-icon.png )|
|Business Central embedded in any other applications |![No](media/x-icon.png )|

### Data access

Users are entitled to read table data but can't modify, create or delete records. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform automatically prevents writing to any data tables.  

### Use of objects

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses doesn't restrict which Business Central objects or object ranges can be accessed. Users are entitled to access the Microsoft base application and any extensions such as customizations and add-on apps.

## Simplified user interface

Users are entitled to a reduced set of features and functions provided by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Teams. The tables below indicate noteworthy features. This isn't an exhaustive list and is subject to change.

## Minimum requirements

This section describes the minimum requirements that must be met for your organization to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, and for individual Microsoft Teams users to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data without a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### Requirements to enable access

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (SaaS).

### Requirements for individual users to access data in Teams

- Data must be accessed using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. Users must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed and must use one of the supported Teams clients. Get a list of Teams clients supported by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

- Users must be internal to the organization, meaning that a user identity originates from the same home tenant where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed and where access is enabled. External identities aren't supported. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically prevents access to guests.

- Users must be assigned a Microsoft 365 license from one of the following plans.

# Work with assembly BOMs

You use assembly bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from components with little to no resource use. An assembly BOM can be used, for example, to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of component items.

Use assembly orders to make finished items from components in a process that one or more basic resources can perform, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity on an assembly order, the assembly order lines are filled in according to the assembly BOM. The order has one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports production BOMs. Production BOMs differ from assembly BOMs because they involve more complex procedures, such as resource usage, production routing, and work or machine centers. Learn more about the differences at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) and [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## To create an assembly BOM

To define an item that consists of other items, and perhaps the resources that assemble the item, you must create an assembly BOM.  

Assembly BOMs can have multiple levels, which means that a component on the assembly BOM can be an assembly item itself. In that case, the **Assembly BOM** field on the assembly BOM line contains **Yes**.

Special requirements apply to items on assembly BOMs regarding availability. Learn more at [To see the availability of an item by its use in assembly BOMs](inventory-how-availability-overview.md#to-view-the-availability-of-an-item-by-its-use-in-assembly-or-production-boms).

There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM:

- Setting up a new item.
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item.

1. Set up a new item. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

   Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM.  
2. On the **Item Card** page for an assembly item, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Assembly items can have variants, just like any other item, which helps you keep your list of products shorter. Learn more about the feature at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).

## To edit assembly BOMs

You can edit the lines on an assembly BOM at any time. However, the BOM might be in use by ongoing sales or assemblies of the parent. Changing the BOM might affect those activities. Choose the **Where-Used** action to explore the items that use it and whether sales or assembly orders might be affected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Yes** value in the **Assembly BOM** column.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Edit List** action, then change any field as needed.

## To view components and resources indented according to the BOM structure

From the **Assembly BOM** page, you can open a separate page that shows the components and any resources indented according to their BOM position under the assembly item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Show BOM** action.

## To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines

From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item, you can use a special action to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components. This action is useful, for example, if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item.

The **Explode BOM** action is also available on the **Assembly BOM** page as a way to view subassembly items on an assembly BOM.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you have used the **Explode BOM** action, you can't easily undo it. You must delete the sales order lines for the components and then reenter a sales order line for the assembly item.

The following procedure is based on a sales invoice. The same steps apply to other sales documents and all purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item.
3. Choose the line for an assembly item, then **Explode BOM** line action.

All fields on the sales invoice line for the assembly item are cleared except for the **Item** and **Description** fields. Complete sales invoice lines are inserted for the components and possible resources that comprise the assembly item.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Picking List by Order** report is also changed to show the components only. This means that a warehouse worker picking the parent item, the assembly item, will not see it in the picking list. Learn more at [Print the Picking List](sales-how-print-picking-list.md).

## To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item

You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item's assembly BOM.

The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components, including other assembly BOMs, and any resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Calc. Standard Cost** action.
5. Select one of the following options, then choose the **OK** button.

|Option |Description |
|-------|------------|
|**Top Level**|Calculates the assembly item's standard cost as the total cost of all purchased or assembled items on that assembly BOM regardless of any underlying assembly BOMs.|
|**All Levels**|Calculates the assembly's item standard cost as the sum of:</br></br>* The calculated cost of all underlying assembly BOMs on the assembly BOM.</br>* The cost of all purchased items on the assembly BOM.|

The costs of the items that make up the assembly BOM are copied from the component item cards. The cost of each item is multiplied by the quantity, and the total cost is shown in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).

# Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps in Power BI

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] online 

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] publishes the following Power BI apps, which provide detailed dashboards for viewing data:

- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - CRM  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Finance  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Sales

## Overview

Each app includes several reports that you can drill into for data, including the following features:

- Choose any visual on the dashboard to bring up one of the underlying reports.  
- Filter the report or add fields that you want to monitor.  
- Pin a customized view to the dashboard to continue tracking.  
  You can refresh data manually, and you can set up a refresh schedule. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).  

The apps are designed to work with data from any company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you install the Power BI app, you specify one or more parameters to connect to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> You can also build your own reports and dashboards in Power BI based on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data. For more information, see [Connecting Your Business Data to Power BI](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md). 

## Prerequisites

Power BI apps require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved and the web services used to retrieve data. The following table lists the web services required for each Power BI app:
    
|App|Web services |

## Fixing problems

The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above. It shows data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account hasn't been set up. You must have a license to get a valid Power BI account. Also, you must have previously signed into Power BI to create your Power BI workspace.  

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Select report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or the report deployed but didn't successfully refresh. If this problem happens, navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

### You need a Power BI Pro license to install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

You need a [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type) to share your content, and the people you share it with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).  

### "Parameter validation failed, please make sure all parameters are valid"

This error indicates that one more of the parameters aren't valid.

- The specified environment parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] production or sandbox environment.
- The specified company parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies. Verify the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- If connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you entered a URL that isn't valid. You can verify the URL in the **Web Services** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A port isn't open to allow the request through your firewall.

### Can't sign in

If you get a "login failed" error after using your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user credentials to sign in, then you're probably experiencing one of the following issues:

- The account that you're using doesn't have permissions to retrieve the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your account. Verify that you have permissions to the required data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and try again.
- You've selected an authentication type other than Basic, if connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
- You haven't entered a valid user name or password.

### Message: Your data source can't be refreshed because the credentials are invalid. Please update your credentials and try again

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the problem might be that the OData URL is only exposed to the local network.

### Incorrect company name

A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### The key didn't match any rows in the table

If you enter a non-valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.

### Historical data appears to be missing

Once the Power BI app installs and your data show in Power BI, you notice that not all your data displays. The datasets are filtered to only return the previous 365 days of data. This default is in place to help make the reports faster.  

### I only see data for a single company

The Power BI app will only display data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company that was defined when the Power BI app was installed. Data from additional companies can be added to the reports by adding new queries that use different companies as the data source.  

### What now?

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](/power-bi/service-q-and-a-tips) at the top of the dashboard.
- [Change the tiles](/power-bi/service-dashboard-edit-tile) in the dashboard.  
- [Select a tile](/power-bi/service-dashboard-tiles) to open the underlying report.  
- By default, your dataset isn't scheduled to refresh. You can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

# About item types

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory. The following table lists and describes the three types of items that are available.

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|Physical things, such as bicycles, telephones, and desks, for which you want to be able to use all inventory processes. Inventory items can also include nonphysical items, such as software licenses and subscriptions, if the items have identification numbers, such as serial numbers. You can fully track item values and availability in inventory.|
|Non-Inventory|Typically, noninventory items are physical things, such as bolts or pens, that your business consumes but doesn't fully track in inventory. For example, because they're low-cost items and only used internally.|
|Service|A labor time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types don't let you track inventory quantities and values. Only selected item transaction types and features are supported. The following table lists the features that the three item types support.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|Order Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

## Costing methods for types of items

When you post inventory transactions, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively.

You record the cost of inventory items in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field on the **Value Entries** page. When you reconcile the entry to the general ledger, the cost shows in the **Cost Posted to G/L** field. To learn more about inventory costing, go to [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

For noninventory and service items, cost is recorded in the **Cost Amount (Non-Invtbl.)** field on the **Value Entries** page. For noninventory and service items, specify cost on sales, assembly, and production documents and journals. Specify the default cost in the **Unit Cost** field on the **Item Card** and **Stockkeeping Unit** pages. Costs for these types of items aren't reconciled to the general ledger.

## Catalog and service items

You can set up items that you offer to your customers but you don't manage in until you sell them as catalog items. Although catalog items are similar to regular items of the type **Non-Inventory** in this respect, don't confuse the two because there are differences. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

Customer items that you service, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalog items. However, service components can be regular items. To learn more, go to [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).

## Resources

In addition to the item type *Item*, sales and purchase documents also allow you to use the item type *Resource*. Like items, resources support dimensions, price lists, and units of measure. <!--With introduction of types *Service* and *Non-Inventory* we do not have any intention to add any extra capabilities for type Resource in purchase and sales processes. We recommend using items of applicable type instead. Resources will continue get new functionality to track the time and effort that is involved with performing and providing services and will stay important part of project and service management. Because many partner solutions use resources, we do not plan to deprecate them in the sales or purchase documents.-->

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

# Post Capacities

In the capacity journal, you post consumed capacities that are not assigned to the production order. For example, maintenance work must be assigned to capacity, but not to a production order.  

## To post capacities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.  
3. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the capacity, either **Machine Center** or **Work Center**, that you are posting.  
4. In the **No.** field, enter the number of the machine center or work center.  
5. Enter the relevant data in the other fields, such as **Starting Time**, **Ending Time**, **Quantity**, and **Scrap**.  
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the capacities.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view work center ledger entries  

In the **Work Center Card** and **Machine Center Card** pages, you can view the posted capacities as a result of finished production orders.    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant **Work Center** card from the list, and then choose the **Capacity Ledger Entries** action.

# Use e-documents in the purchases process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following purchase documents:  

- Purchase invoices
- Purchase orders
- Purchase credit memos
- General journals

> [!NOTE]
> When you receive an e-document from a specific vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the e-document with the vendor by verifying the following information in this order:
>
> 1. **GLN** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **VAT Registration No.** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Participation Identifier** from the **Service Participant** page (using the **E-Document Service Participation** field from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Name** and **Address** (from the Vendor card)

## E-documents in purchases

You can receive purchase e-documents manually, or by using the **Receive** batch job.  

### Set up vendors to work with different purchase documents  

Follow these steps to configure vendors for incoming electronic invoices:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the vendor you want to configure.
3. On the **Receiving** FastTab, in the **Receive E-Document To** field, specify the default purchase document to generate from the received e-document.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - In the **Receive E-Document To** field, you can either select a **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Order** based on what you want to create from the received e-invoice. This selection doesn't affect the creation of corrective documents. In both scenarios, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates a credit memo.
   >
   > - If you choose the **Purchase Order** option in the **Receive E-Document To** field, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tries to update an existing purchase order. If the purchase order doesn't exist for a vendor in the received e-document, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new purchase order. It creates the order using the same approach as when it creates a new purchase invoice. To learn more, go to [To work with purchase invoices](#to-work-with-purchase-invoices).

4. Choose one of the options you want to use for the selected vendor.
5. Close the page.

### To work with purchase invoices  

#### Run the batch job  

> [!NOTE]

> This batch job automates the process of collecting your incoming invoices. It works only in countries or regions where the functionality is available.  

Every time a **Job Queue** is selected to run, if the external service has incoming invoices from your vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] collects and imports the invoices. To complete the process, follow these steps:

1. After the batch job finishes, the **E-Documents** page lists the imported invoices and their basic details.
2. To view more details, open a specific e-document.
3. Depending on whether your e-document setup automatically processes invoices, or requires that you review and confirm the details before processing, follow these steps. To learn more about how to require confirmation, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

   **Automatic processing**

   1. If you automatically process invoices, and there are no errors or issues in the e-document, the **Record** field maps the document number of the purchase invoice if a number series is specified on the **Vendor Card** page. To open the document, select the link.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This system-created document isn't the posted document.

   2. To go directly to the purchase document, select the **Record** field. After you open the **Purchase Invoice** page, check the document. If everything is correct, post the document.  
   3. When you post the purchase document, the **Record** field on the **E-Document** is updated from **Invoice** to **Purchase Invoice**, and the number of the posted purchase document is available. You can select the number to open the posted purchase invoice.

   Details about logs are the same as they are in the sales process for e-documents.  

   **Review and confirm before processing**

   1. If you must review and confirm the details before processing the invoice, open the document.
   1. On the **E-Document** page, choose the **View extracted data** action.
   1. On the **Received purchase document data** page, review the details. If things look good, choose **OK**.
   1. To process the invoice, follow the steps described for **Automatic processing**.

   > [!TIP]
   > When you receive an incoming e-document, it's typically in XML or similar format that can be difficult, if not impossible, to read. For example, if you aren't technical and don't understand the XML format, it might be hard to review an invoice before you process it. To make it easier for everyone to review incoming e-documents, invoices and credit memos have an **E-invoice Lines** FastTab that displays details from the imported file, such as line and header information, in a way that's easy to understand.
   >
   > The preview feature is only available for invoice and credit memo types of incoming e-documents.

### Handle errors and warnings

Because errors in the sales process are mostly related to the availability of the service, the incoming document can contain multiple reasons. The most common reason for an error is that the system can't recognize the lines on the e-document that you got from your vendor. Therefore, it can't enter lines in your purchase invoice.

There are two common errors:  

- If you want to use this specific line from your vendor invoice that was directly posted to the general ledger (G/L) account, you must correctly configure the **Mapping Text** value. To bypass this error, if you want to use G/L accounts, select the **Map Text to Account** to create a specific mapping of the **Mapping Text** value with the **Debit Acc. No.** value that you want to use. Learn more about account mapping [here](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md#to-map-text-on-an-e-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).  
- If you want to track the inventory and use lines from your vendor invoice to fill in the items on your document lines, you must correctly configure the **Item Reference No.** value. To bypass this error, map the external item with your item numbers by using the item reference list. Learn more in [use item references](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

After you fix the errors and warnings, you can manually specify when to create a purchase invoice based on your setup by selecting **Create Document**.

### Recreate a deleted purchase invoice or credit memo

Mistakes happen, so it's important to be able to fix them quickly. If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo and can't link the incoming e-document to the correct one, you can now recreate a new purchase document based on details in the e-document. Problem solved, and you can go take care of other business.

If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo, you can't proceed with the e-document connection with the regular purchase document in Business Central. To get yourself unstuck, you can run the **Recreate Document** action from the e-document. The action creates an unposted purchase invoice or credit memo based on the type of incoming document, its information, and the G/L mapping or item references used.

> [!NOTE]
> The action works only with unposted purchase invoices and credit memos. It doesn't work for purchase orders.

#### To map text on an e-document to a specific vendor account

To map lines with expenses for E-Documents, you need to map description with **G/L Account**. Then, use the **Map Text to Account** action to link specific text on a vendor invoice from the **E-Document Service** to a vendor account. Any part of the E-document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type **G/L Account** are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. Use this option for electronic documents related to expenses that are paid. It is for e-documents for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant E-Document line with the displayed error message and then choose **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page displays.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that appears on vendor invoices for which you want to create purchase documents or journal lines. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor to create the purchase document or journal line for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that is inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use the **Credit Acc. No.**, **Bal. Source Type, and **Bal. Source No.** fields with E-documents.

5. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all error messages on E-documents that you want to automatically create **G/L Accounts** and documents for.  

#### Manually import one or more invoices  

To manually import one or more external e-documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Documents**, and then select the related link.  
1. On the **E-Documents** page, choose the **New From File** action.
1. On the **E-Document Services** page, choose the service, and then upload the documents.

#### Work with attachments  

Peppol and similar e-invoicing files are machine-readable formats that aren't easy for people to read. To improve reading, Peppol made it possible to embed a PDF file into the Peppol BIS 3 format as a binary object. If your incoming Peppol BIS 3 file has an embedded PDF, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically processes it and adds the PDF as an attachment to the purchase document after creating it.

## E-documents with purchase orders  

### Link purchase orders with the received e-documents

If your **Vendor** configured the **Received E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, once an electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from external end point), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following steps:  

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the receive **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links this **E-Document** with the mentioned **Purchase Order**, and the **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Order linked**. This link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**. If you need to change the **Purchase Order** linked automatically, you can do it using the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and manually select one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor. You can only do it before matching the lines between **E-Document** and **Purchase Order**.  

2. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists but there's no purchase order number in the received **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the possibility to choose one of the existing purchase orders when and if you uploaded this document manually. This condition opens the **Purchase Orders** list with orders only for the vendor from whom you received the **E-Document**. You need to select the **Purchase Order** you want and then select **OK**. If you failed to select the correct **Purchase Order**, or obtained the **E-Document** automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, a new **E-Document** isn't linked to any purchase document. The **Document Status** then shows **Error**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage also shows **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking with the **Purchase Order**, select the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and choose one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor.

3. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor doesn't exist when a new **E-Document** is created, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new **Purchase Order**, using the same model of creation that already exists for new **Purchase Invoices**. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **Processed**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Imported document created**. After which, this link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**.

### Matching lines from received e-document with purchase order  

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase orders' lines from two different places: from the **E-Document** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to locate the already linked **Purchase Orders** is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile as a part of **E-Document Activities**. All nonlinked documents can be found using the tile **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** where you have a list of **E-Documents** that you need to review. The **E-Document Activities** with these two tiles can be found in the following **Role Centers**: Business Manager Evaluation, Business Manager, Accountant, Inventory Manager, and Shipping and Receiving.

> [!TIP]
> There are two ways to match lines. One way is to do it manually, as described in the article. The other way is to use the **E-document matching assistance with Copilot**. The E-document matching assistance feature helps you match received electronic invoices with existing purchase order lines by using large language modules (LLM) model. Learn more about using Copilot in [Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot](map-edocuments-with-copilot.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the VAT percentage differs between the incoming document and the company's VAT percentage, matching documents can't be used in a multi-country environment.  

#### Matching lines from purchase order  

You can match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list or from one of the opened **Purchase Orders**. To begin process, use the following steps:  

1. Select the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center if there's a number.
2. Choose one of the two options for matching:

   - If you want to match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list, select the **Purchase Order** line that you want to match and select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.  
   - If you want to first open the **Purchase Order**, open the document and then select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.

3. Because both options have the same process, the **Purchase Order Matching** page opens with the following content:

    1. In the header you can find the following information, which can help you to map the lines easier:

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |Vendor Name |Specifies the vendor’s name of the electronic document. |
       |E-Document No. |Specifies the linked electronic document number. |
       |E-Document Date |Specifies the linked electronic document date.  |
       |E-Document Amount |Specifies the linked e-document total amount including VAT. |

    2. In the lines, you can find the lines imported from the **E-Document** file on the left side and the lines from the existing **Purchase Order** on the right.  
    3. All lines on both sides have item numbers and descriptions, together with the **Direct Unit Cost** and **Line Discount %**.  
    4. On the **Imported Lines** side, you can also locate the **Quantity** field as a total quantity from e-invoice and the **Matched Quantity** field specifying the quantity that already matched to the purchase order lines.
    5. On the **Purchase Orders Lines** side, you can also find the **Available Quantity** as the quantity that can be matched to this line (received, but not invoiced quantity) and **Qty. to Invoice**, specifying the quantity that is already matched to this line.
    6. To match lines, select the lines on both sides that you want to match and select the **Match Manually** action. The matched lines are marked in green.
    7. It's possible to match one to one, but it's also possible to match many to one or one to many, by selecting more lines on one side or the other before you choose the **Match Manually** action.
    8. You can also select the **Match Automatically** action to automatically match all lines with the same **Type**, **No.**, **Unit Price**, **Discount**, and **Unit of Measure**.
    9. If you make a mistake, you can select the **Remove Match** action to remove the matched lines on the purchase order side or select the **Reset Matching** action to reset all that match.
    10. If your **E-Document** has many lines, you can select the **Show Pending Lines** action during the matching process to remove all the e-document lines if they're already matched. If you need to view all the lines, you can always select the **Show All Lines** action. 

4. After you finish the matching, select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action.
5. After you apply the matching to the purchase order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the following fields:

    1. The **Vendor Invoice No.** and **Document Date** fields on the document header update with values from the electronic document that you received and linked.
    2. The **Qty. to Invoice** field on the lines update with the values from the **Qty. to Invoice** column from the **Purchase Order Matching** page based on the match.
    3. Now you can post the document by choosing the **Post** action.  
    4. After you post the document, the value in the **Document** field on the **E-Document** page changes to relate to the **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
    5. Close the page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you can match only the lines that have the same total amount in both documents. That means **Direct Unit Cost** together with the applied Line **Discount %** must be the same, because in one document you can have an amount without discount and in another with discount.  

If you want to add tolerance and allow the difference between lines in e-invoice and purchase order, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. Allow tolerance in the **E-Document Matching Difference %** field by specifying the maximum percentage of cost difference to allow when matching an incoming e-document line with a purchase order line.
3. This setup applies to all the matching lines, but considers the tolerance for the total amount, as for **Direct Unit Cost** together with applied **Line Discount %**.  
4. Close the page.

##### Other options  

If your inbound electronic invoice has lines that aren't on your purchase order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from posting the document because you can't partially post an incoming invoice. Therefore, you must ensure that you all invoice lines are correctly mapped to the purchase order. If you experience this issue, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. On the **Imported Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page, choose the line that doesn't exist on the purchase order. Now choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AssistEdit button."::: button, and choose the **Create Purchase Order Line** action.  
2. On the **E-Doc. Create Purch Order Line** page, in the **Type** field, choose the type of line you want to create in your purchase order. You can choose any of type.
3. Based on the line type, you can choose the **No.** to specify what you received. For example, an item, general ledger account, resource, and so on.
4. The unit of measure, quantity, amount, discount, and other values are copied from the inbound invoice line.
5. You can select the **Learn matching rule** field to specify whether to create a matching rule. This feature works only for items and G/L accounts. Item references are created for items and text to account mappings are created for G/L accounts.
6. Select **OK**.
7. A purchase order line is created on the purchase order, and you can map it on the **Purchase Order Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the quantity, the unit amount recalculates to the same total amount as the original invoice line.  

#### Matching lines from e-document  

To match the lines on the **E-Document** page, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Documents**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **E-Document** that you want to match.
3. Choose the **Match Purchase Order** action to open the **Purchase Order Matching** page.  
4. Repeat the same steps that you used when you started matching from purchase orders.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** Role Center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Incoming e-documents:**
  - Processed
  - In Progress
  - Error

# Setting up inventory

Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

After you set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Managing intercompany transactions

Businesses with more than one legal entity with separate accounting functions can benefit from intercompany transactions. For example, it's useful for businesses that have subsidiaries in multiple international markets or regions. Or, an organization might have several companies but lack the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. Intercompany transactions simplify and streamline business processes and transactions between companies in the intercompany partnership.

After you specify the customer and vendor relationships for intercompany transactions, partners enter information one time in sales and purchase documents. A corresponding document is created at the other partner involved in the transaction. Mapping the chart of accounts and dimensions helps ensure that information appears in the right places.  

There are four main benefits to the intercompany functionality:  

* Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
* Minimized mistakes with one-time entry of information and system-wide, automated updates  
* Transparent audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
* Efficient transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

## Streamline the flow of business activities  

Intercompany transactions let you distribute sales and purchasing documents and general journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies. Distributing transactions saves time and increases efficiency throughout the organization by reducing data entry. It cuts down on the need to send, receive, print, and archive sales and purchasing documents.  

You're in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and use the **Reverse Journal Postings** and **Undo Receipts/Shipments** actions to make corrections. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company hasn't shipped the goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you don't need to specify the accounts to use. You just choose the intercompany partner. The intercompany functionality creates general journal lines that balance the books of both companies involved in the transaction. In receivables and payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices for transactions between these companies produce corresponding documents in the partner company. The result is correctly balanced accounts.  

Intercompany focuses on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines, and allows transactions between multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases. For example:

* Different countries/regions
* Multiple currencies
* Different charts of accounts
* Different dimensions
* Different item numbers  

Intercompany transactions use several types of entries and documents:  

* General journal entries
* Purchase and sales orders
* Purchase and sales invoices
* Credit memos
* Return orders

When you set up intercompany transactions, you create a list of intercompany partners, an intercompany chart of accounts, and intercompany dimensions. Afterward, you can create transactions in intercompany general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> The general journal by itself doesn't include currencies. It converts all amounts to the local currency at the current exchange rate.

After you set up business partners as customers and vendors, and assign them intercompany partner codes, they can exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. 

> [!NOTE]
> Companies can't use intercompany to exchange all types of data. Purchase invoices are not submitted to business partners through intercompany processes. However, sales invoices that are submitted through intercompany processes will be created as purchase invoices in the receiving company.

Consolidating financial data might be relevant for intercompany processes. For more information, see [Consolidating Financial Data from Multiple Companies](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

# Work with calendar dates and times

You can enter dates and times in multiple ways. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] includes powerful features that accelerate data entry, or help you write complex calendar expressions. There are various places throughout the application where you can enter dates and times in fields. For example, on a sales order, you can set the shipment date. When filtering lists or report data, you can enter dates and times to pinpoint only the data that you're interested in.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Check your region and language settings

The **My Settings** page specifies the **Region** and **Language** that you're using in the application. These settings influence how you enter dates and times.

- The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted.

- For date patterns that involve words, the language of the words that you use must correspond to the **Language** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] uses the Gregorian calendar system.

## Entering dates

In a date field, you can enter a date using the standard format for your region setting. Different regions can use different separators between the days, months, and years. For example, some regions use dashes (mm-dd-yyyy) and others use forward slashes (mm/dd/yyyy).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use any separators, even a space, and the date will automatically be changed to use separators that match your region.

> [!NOTE]
> The format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents isn't influenced by your personal choice of region setting.

To work more productively with dates and times, you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections.

### Picking dates from the calendar

Any field displaying a calendar icon can be set using the calendar date picker. To display the calendar date picker, activate the calendar icon or select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> keyboard shortcut in the field.

![Date fields.](media/ui-date-field.png "Example of a date field")

See also [Keyboard Shortcuts in the calendar date picker](keyboard-shortcuts.md#calendarshortcuts).

### Day\-week\-year pattern

You can enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and, optionally, a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25. If you don't enter a year, the year of the work date is used.

Instead of entering the entire word for the day of the week, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. If there were conflicts (such as with s which could be Saturday or Sunday), the days are evaluated according to the region setting. The input is first evaluated against work date and today as well, which you want to keep in mind when abbreviating. For example, _t_ already means today, so it can't mean Tuesday or Thursday.

The week number scheme is always ISO 8601, where week 1 is the week with 4 January in it, or the week with the first Thursday of the year.

### Digit patterns

In a date field you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:

- Two digits are interpreted as the day, and it adds the month and the year of the work date.

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month, and it adds the year of the work date. Your region settings determine the order of the day and month. Even if your region settings have the year before the day and month, four digits are interpreted as the day and month.

- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, you can enter the year with two digits; otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

### Today

Enter the word for _today_, in the language specified on the **My Settings** page, to set the date on a record to today's date. Instead of entering the entire word, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. For example, in English, you can enter _t_ or _tod_, as long as it isn't also the start of another word.

### Period

To filter on a specific accounting period, in a date field enter the letter p, or the word period, followed by a number that identifies the accounting period, like p2 or period4. The accounting period is relative to the fiscal year of the current work date that set in your Role Center. For example, if the work date is **03/21/22**, then _p1_, or just _p_, filters on the first accounting period of the fiscal year 2022 (such as 01/01/22..01/31/22). _p15_ filters on the 15th accounting period from the start of fiscal year 2022 (such as 03/01/23..03/31/23).

The accounting periods are defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. To view or change the accounting periods, open the page [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=100).

### Work Date

Use a work date to specify a date that isn't today's date on records. For example, a work date is useful when you need to set a particular date for multiple records. You specify the work date on the **My Settings** page. 

A fast way to enter the work date on records is to enter some or all of the word _work_. Start from the beginning of the word in the language in which you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. For example, in English, you can enter _w_ or _work_. The language is also specified on the **My Settings** page.

If a work date isn't specified, today's date is used. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings, such as the Work Date](ui-change-basic-settings.md#work-date).

### Closing date

When you close a fiscal year, you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry. A closing date technically is between two dates, for example between December 31 and January 1.

To specify that a date is a closing date, put C just before the date, such as C123101. Use this format in combination with all the date patterns.

### Examples

The following table contains examples of dates using all the formats. It assumes region settings that format dates according to: **year.month.day.**, a week starting on Monday, and the English language.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|2022.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|221231|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|20221231|2022.12.31.|
|22/12,31|2022.12.31.|
|11|work date year.work date month.11.|
|1112|work date year.11.12.|
|t or today|today's date|
|p4|date range that includes the fourth accounting period, such as 04/01/20..04/30/20|
|w or work date|the working date|
|m or Monday|Monday of the work date week|
|tu or Tuesday|Tuesday of the work date week|
|sa or Saturday|Saturday of the work date week|
|s or Sunday|Sunday of the work date week|
|t23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t 23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t-1|Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year|

##  <a name="BKMK_SettingDateRanges"></a> Setting ranges

To display only the data contained in that range, on lists, totals, and reports you can filter on dates, times, and datetimes with a start value and optionally an end value. The standard rules apply to the way you set date ranges.

|**Meaning**|**Sample expression (Date)**|**Data included in the filter**|
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Interval|12 15 00..01 15 01<br /><br />..12 15 00<br /><br />p1..p4|Records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 01 15 01.<br /><br />Records with dates of 12 15 00 or earlier.<br /><br />Date range that includes the second, third, and fourth accounting periods, such as 01/01/20..04/30/20.|
|Either/or|12 15 00\|12 16 00|Records with dates of either 12 15 00 or 12 16 00. If there are records with dates on both days, they all display.|
|Combination|12 15 00\|12 01 00..12 10 00  <br /><br />..12 14 00\|12 30 00..|Records with dates of 12 15 00 or on dates between and including 12 01 00 and 12 10 00.  <br /><br />Records with dates of 12 14 00 or earlier, or dates of 12 30 00 or later, that is, all records except records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 12 29 00.|

You can use any of the valid formats in date range filters. For example, mon14 3..t 4p applied on a datetime field results in a filter from 3 AM on Monday in week 14 of the current work date year until today at 4PM.

## Use date formulas

A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter 1W, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days \(one true week\) including the period starting date, then you must enter 6D or 1W-1D.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line posts.
- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the date of the previous reminder) before a reminder is created.
- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for calendar units.

|  Letter  |  Meaning  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use C, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month (last day of the month)|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number can't be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, 1W  means seven working days.
<!--
# Entering Date Ranges
You can set filters containing a start date and an end date to display only the data contained in that date range or time interval. Special rules apply to the way you set date ranges. Let's take the **Customer Top 10** as an example:

![Setting a date range in the request page for the Customer Top 10 list.](./media/ui-enter-date-ranges/customer-top10-list.png)

Here you can limit the report to a date range such as the past 2 weeks, or a total of 6 weeks, or whatever range you want. To set date ranges, you enter dates and then use either **..** or **|** to set the range. In our example, to show the top 10 customers for the first two weeks of May, you would set the date filter to *05 01 17..05 14 17*.
Here are a couple of other examples:

| Meaning | Example | Entries included |
|---|---|---|
|Equal to| 12 15 16 |Only those posted on December 15 2016.|
|Interval| 12 15 16..01 15 17<br /><br />..12 15 16|Those posted on dates between and including December 15 2016 and January 15 2017.<br /><br />Those posted on December 15 2016 or earlier.|
|Either/or|12 15 16&#124;12 16 16|Those posted on either December 15 or December 16 2016. If there are entries posted on both days, they will all be displayed.|

You can also combine the various format types.

| Example | Entries included |
|---|---|
|12 15 16&#124;12 01 16..05 31 17 | Entries posted either on December 15 2016 or on dates between and including December 01 2016 and May 31 2017. |
|..12 14 16&#124;12 30 16.. | Entries posted on December 14 or earlier, or entries posted on December 30 or later - that is, all entries except those posted on dates between and including December 15 and 29. |

Note that we have used the US date format MMDDYY here. As [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] becomes available in other markets, you'll be able to use the formats that you are used to.

## Use Date Formulas
A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter **1W**, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days (one true week) including the period starting date, then you must enter **6D** or **1W\-1D**.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted.

- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the due date of the previous reminder) before a reminder will be created.

- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for time specifications.

|  Letter  |  Time specification  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use **C**, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number cannot be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM\+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, **1W**  means seven working days.

-->

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any nonspace separators that you want between the units. If you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds, then it isn't required.

You only have to write the largest units that you require; the rest are set to zero. You can also leave out any AM/PM indicator.

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted. It assumes region settings that format times according to **Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds** and use the AM and PM indicators.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|05:23:17|05:23:17|
|5|05:00:00|
|5AM|05:00:00|
|5P|17:00:00|
|12|12:00:00|
|12A|00:00:00|
|12P|12:00:00|
|17|17:00:00|
|5:30|05:30:00|
|0530|05:30:00|
|5:30:5|05:30:05|
|053005|05:30:05|
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|
|053005050|05:30:05.05|

> [!NOTE]
> Milliseconds are interpreted as decimal notation. So, for example, 3, 30, and 300 all mean 300 milliseconds, while 03 means 30 and 003 means 3 milliseconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use 24:00 to mean midnight, or use any value greater than 24:00.

The word for *time* in the language used by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] is the current time on your computer or mobile device. You can enter a part of the word starting from the beginning, such as **t** or **TIM**.

## Entering combined dates and times

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

Some fields in the application represent a duration, or amount of elapsed time, instead of a specific date or time. You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.

Here are some examples.

|**Duration**|**Unit of measure**|
|------------|-------------------|
|2h|2 hrs|
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|

You can also enter a number that automatically converts to a duration. The number converts according to the default unit of measure that is specified for the duration field.

It's easy to find out which unit of measure a duration field uses. Enter a number, and then look at the unit of measure it converts to.

For example, if the unit of measure is hours, the number 5 converts to 5 hrs.

# Handle vendor payment disputes

You can mark a vendor ledger entry as **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document. The on hold status helps you maintain transparency and efficiency while you manage and resolve the issue.

## To set a vendor ledger entry on hold

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor ledger entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to mark.
3. Choose **Edit List**. You can now enter up to 3 characters (likely your initials) in the **On Hold** field to indicate the document is on hold. 

## On hold entries, and the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job

The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [Suggest vendor payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).


## Analyzing On hold vendor ledger entries 

There are multiple other options for analyzing entries on hold. 

For instance, on the **Vendor ledger entries** page you can set a filter on the **On Hold** field to this value
``` Filter
<>''
```


You can also take the vendor ledger entries list page into analysis mode and define an analysis tab. To learn more, go to
[Using data analysis to show vendor ledger entries on hold](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold)


Or you can run the [Payments on Hold](reports/report-319.md) report.

## Block vendors

You can also block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor for purchase documents, or so that they can't post payments to the vendor.

To learn more, go to [Block vendors](payables-how-block-vendors.md).

# Visit our video library

You found our documentation. But some people prefer to watch content rather than read it. To that end, we're producing short, easily digestible videos. Most videos supplement our user assistance, and some of them can be viewed on their own.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can launch the introduction videos from the welcome page that displays. If you're already working in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can get to the library from the **Business Manager** and **Accountant** Role Centers by choosing the **Product Videos** tile.  

> [!Tip]  
> Videos in the library display in a frame that might seem a little small. To make the frame larger, choose the double-ended arrow icon in the upper-right corner. Afterward, videos will display in the larger frame until you make it small again.

# Setting Up Relationship Management

Before you get started working with your contacts and marketing interests, there are a few decisions and steps that you should take to set up how the marketing area manages certain aspects of your contacts. For example, you can decide whether to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, vendor card, and bank account card, how number series are defined, or what the standard salutation should be when writing to your contacts.

Managing your contacts and having a strategy in place to identify, attract, and retain customers will help optimize your business and increase customer satisfaction. Using a good contact management system will also help you create and maintain relationships with your customers. Communication is the key to these relationships. Being able to tailor communication with potential and existing customers, vendors, and business partners according to their needs, is necessary for companies to succeed. Establishing a strategy and defining how your company uses contact information is a primary step. This information will be viewed by many different groups in your company, so having a good system in place will help everyone be more productive.

You set up the marketing and contact management from the **Marketing Setup** page. To open the **Marketing Setup** page, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Marketing Setup**, and then choose the related link.

## Automatically Copying Specific Information from Contact Companies to Contact Persons
Some information about contact companies is identical to the information about the contact persons working within these companies, for example, the address details. In the **Inheritance** section of the **Marketing Setup** page, you can set the application to automatically copy specific fields from the contact company card to the contact person card each time you create a contact person for a contact company. For example, you can select to copy the salesperson code, address details (address, address 2, city, post code, and county), communication details (fax number, telex answer back, and phone number), and more.

When you modify one of these fields on the contact company card, application will automatically modify the field on the contact person card (unless you have manually modified the field on the contact person card).

For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use Predefined Defaults on New Contacts
You can decide that the application automatically assigns a specific language code, territory code, salesperson code, and country/region code as defaults to each new contact you create. You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The inheritance of fields overwrites the default values you have set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, application will automatically assign German as the language code for the contact persons recorded for that company.

<!--You can also setup a default salutation that application automatically assigns to your contacts. You can use these salutations in your interaction template attachments (for example, Microsoft Word documents). When setting up a default salutation, you can enter a salutation text and a salutation format. For example, if the salutation text is Dear, and the salutation format is Salutation Text + Title + Name, application will automatically enter Dear Mr. John Smith as a salutation for a contact called John Smith.-->

## Automatically Recording Interactions
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically record sales and purchase documents as interactions (for example, orders, invoices, receipts, and so on), as well as emails, phone calls, and cover sheets.

For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## Synchronizing Contacts with Customers and More
In order to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, the vendor card and the bank account card, you must select a business relation code for customers, vendors, and bank accounts. For example, you can only link a contact with an existing customer if you have selected a business relation code for customers on the **Marketing Setup** page.

For more information, see [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).  

## Assigning a Number Series to Contacts and Opportunities
You can set up a number series for contacts and opportunities. If you have set up a number series for contacts, when you create a contact, and select <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the No. field on the contact card, application automatically enters the next available contact number.

For more information about number series, see [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## Searching for Duplicate Contacts when Contacts are Created
You can choose to have application automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact company, or you can choose to search manually after you have created contacts. You can also choose to have application update the search strings automatically each time you modify contact information or create a contact. You can decide the search hit percentage, that is, the percentage of identical strings two contacts must have for application to consider them as duplicates.

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

title: Export your Business Central data to Excel
description: You can export your financial reports and business intelligence data from Business Central to Excel, or open your data in Excel.

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# Define user tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

Some usage scenarios for User Tasks are 

| If you work with... | Set up user tasks to track or follow-up on... |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Finance             | Month-end checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Adjust cost<br>* Set a posting date range<br>* Close an inventory period<br>* Reconcile accounts payable (AP)<br>* Reconcile accounts receivable (AR)<br>* Recurring journals<br>* Bank reconciliation |
| Finance             | Year-close checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Financial reporting (prepare and finalize annual financial statements)<br>* Audit preparation (gather necessary documents and information for external auditors)<br>* Budget review (compare actual performance against budget and analyze variances)<br>* Budget planning (develop the budget for the next fiscal year)<br>* Accounts receivable (follow up on outstanding invoices for the fiscal year and write off bad debts if necessary)<br>* Accounts payable (ensure all bills and expenses for the fiscal year are recorded and paid)<br>* Check whether fixed assets depreciations for the fiscal year are posted |
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on lead generation (identifying and contacting potential customers)<br>* Track communications with potential customers<br>* Sales calls/meetings (scheduling and conducting meetings with prospects)<br>* Proposal and quote creation (preparing and sending pricing and service details to prospects)<br>* Sales closing (finalizing deals and signing contracts)<br>* Customer relationship management (maintaining relationships with existing customers for up-selling or cross-selling opportunities)
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on sales target tracking (monitoring progress towards sales goals)<br>* Follow-up on sales activities such as recurring updates on sales targets |
| Sales               |* Weekly/Monthly follow-ups on revenue forecasting (predicting future sales based on current data)<br>* Competitor analysis (keeping an eye on competitor products, prices, and marketing strategies)<br>* Sales reporting (preparing sales reports for management review) |
| Sales               | * Monthly/Quarterly follow-ups on market research (understanding industry trends and customer needs)<br>* Training and development (improving sales skills and product knowledge) |

The list of sample user tasks for sales in the table was generated by AI using Microsoft Copilot. If you want to generate similar lists for your work domain, consider copying and modifying the following prompt:

```Copilot prompt
Come up with a list of common tasks for people working in a sales team that would be useful to track in a system. 

Format the list in bullet form
```

## Managing user task groups

You can use **User Task Groups** to group related tasks and assign them to a group of users instead of individual users. For example, you could create a group for "Month-end" activities and then assign membership to users in the accounting department. This way, anyone in the team can pick up tasks.

## Managing user tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.  

:::image type="content" source="media/across-user-tasks/sample-user-task.png" alt-text="Example of a user task.":::

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you can't link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible. For example, write "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking up user tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

After you complete a task, mark it as completed.  

### Deleting user tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks to delete.

# Tell Me FAQ

This article answers questions that our advanced users often ask about the Tell me what you want to do feature.

## Are all actions from my current page discoverable in Tell Me?

No. Actions in parts, such as the Sales Lines part or FactBoxes, aren't displayed in Tell Me.

## Can I search for a specific record?

Yes. For example, if you want to quickly find a sales order, enter it's identifier, and then choose the **Search company data** action. If you only know the customer's name, enter that. Tell Me arranges results by type, so you could find the order under the Sales Orders category.

## Are the results in Tell Me filtered by permissions?

If the user doesn't have AccessByPermissions, then actions aren't displayed. However, pages and reports appear in the results but require that the user has permission to access them. A message displays if the user doesn't have permission to view the object.

## Does Tell Me display content from my customizations or installed third-party extensions?

Actions, pages, and reports that originate from extensions are picked up by Tell Me. For technical information about how to make custom pages and reports discoverable, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality).

## What makes this different from what was previously known as Page Search?

Page Search has evolved into Tell Me to help you get work done quickly. Page Search could only help you navigate to pages or reports. At a technical level, Tell Me is no longer based on the legacy MenuSuite concept.

## I use on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Does that include Tell Me?

You can use Tell Me in the on-premises Web Client to find actions, pages, and reports, but not apps and consulting services on AppSource.

## Is Tell Me available for all form factors?

Yes. It was introduced on phones and tablets in Business Central 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, it must be enabled in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) using the **Feature: Search for pages and data in the mobile app** switch. In 2024 rlease wave 1 and later, it's always enabled.

<!-- removed in v20 because of Help pane
### Are the documentation results available in any language?
The help articles display in the language you have specified in **My Settings**, if help is available in that language.
-->

## Does Tell Me give me help on how to use pages, reports, and other things?

No, but you can easily get this information from the Help pane. Just select the **Search Help** action in the **Tell me what you want to do** page or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard. To learn more about the Help pane, go to [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane).

### Why don't I see a bookmark icon for my search results?

The bookmark icon isn't displayed in the Tell Me window when personalization is disabled for a user role.

# Sharing Business Data from Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data, like a list of records, specific records, or documents. <!--, with others&mdash;even those people who don't have a Business Central license in some cases.-->

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions of Business Central.

## Copying a link

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and distribute it in other forms of media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser's address box.

When you paste the URL into a rich text editor like Word, Outlook, or Teams, instead of displaying the full URL, the link is given a more readable name that clearly indicates context of the target. The name and pattern vary depending on what page you're linking to. Consider the following examples:

|Pattern|Page example|Link name|
|-|-|-|
|List pages|**Items** list page | **Items**|
|List view|	**Open** filtered view on **Sales Orders** list|**Sales Orders - Open**|
| Single record|Item card showing single record|"Item Card - 1896 ∙ ATHENS Desk"|
|Draft records|	New customer card|**New - Customer card**|
|Company that uses badge|**Items** list page for company with badge **CRONUS**| **Items (CRONUS)**|

> [!TIP]
> A similar naming convention is used on browser tabs.

### Share data analysis
If you're viewing a page or query in the data analysis mode, you can share a specific analysis tab by selecting the down arrowhead on the tab, and then selecting **Copy link**. [Learn more about data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). 

### Modify the page link

After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what shows when the page opens. You can, for example, add filters or specify a different company.

[Learn more about the web client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

### About filtered lists

Using the filter pane on list pages, you can apply filters to narrow-down the records shown in the list. If you use the **Copy Link** action or copy the URL from the browser, the page link won't include your filter changes. Users that open the link see the full collection. The way to keep the filtering on a collection page link is to save the filtered page as a **View** first. Then, open the view and copy the link from there.

[Learn more about sorting, searching, and filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## Sharing to Teams

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Not Supported](media/x-icon.png) Business Central On-premises

Directly from most collection pages and details pages, you can send a link to the page to people, group chats or channels. For example, share a link to a filtered view of your records. If you've installed the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, the link will automatically expand into a compact card for you to include with your message. Recipients then select the link or card to open the page in Business Central.

## Sharing Through OneDrive

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Share** opens a page the let's you select who you want to share the file with. Recipients get a notification email to access the file from your OneDrive.

## Opening in Excel

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

For list pages and lists embedded on a page, you can use the **Open in Excel** action. This action exports the list of records to an Excel workbook (.xlsx file), which you can share with others. In the workbook, you can also use the Share feature that's part of Excel.

## Sharing rows or tables

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

You can share one or more records in a list. Just select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy to your clipboard. Then paste what you copied into another application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. For example, copying three sales orders and pasting that into an email will display the orders in a nicely formatted table.

# FAQ for Suggest Number Series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI effect of the suggest number series feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest number series with Copilot?

Suggest number series can help you create number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language.

* Examples of entities are customers, vendors, and items.
* Examples of documents are quotes, orders, and invoices.

The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use to administrate number series. The feature offers two distinct skills that can help you create new or modify existing number series.

## What are the capabilities of suggest number series?

* Create new number series

   Use natural language to effortlessly set up new number series. Provide examples or masks to define how you envision your setup, and have Copilot draft suggestions for you to build upon.

* Modify existing number series

   Have Copilot help you maintain your existing number series. Extending number series can feel tedious. With Copilot, you can use natural language to modify number series and build upon the suggestions from Copilot.

* Prepare new number series for the next year

   Get ready for the next fiscal year by creating new number series ahead of time.

## What is the intended use of the suggest number series?

The suggest number series capability is intended for system administrators who set up and maintain number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It's a tool to transform requirements written in natural language into the number series structure in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was suggest number series evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest number series? How can users minimize the effect of the limitations when using the system?

The feature works best when you use terminology known to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using alternative terminology might produce results that aren't useful.

* Available geographies

   This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

   [!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted as No. Series.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using suggest number series?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest number series. Even if an administrator enables the feature and it's available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create number series?  

No, the use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to create number series. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time. To learn more, go do [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# General Journal Post Line Overview

Codeunit 12, **Gen. Jnl.-Post Line**, is the major application object for general ledger posting and is the only place to insert general ledger, VAT, and customer and vendor ledger entries. This codeunit is also used for all Apply, Unapply and Reverse operations.  
  
In Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 R2, the codeunit was redesigned because it had become very large, with approximately 7,600 code lines. The architecture was changed and the codeunit has been made simpler and more maintainable. This documentation describes the changes and provides information that you will need for upgrade.  
  
## Old Architecture  
The old architecture had the following features:  
  
* There was extensive use of global variables, which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope.  
* There were many long procedures (with more than 100 code lines) that also had high cyclomatic complexity (that is, a lot of CASE, REPEAT, IF nested statements), which made the code very difficult to read and maintain.  
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local.  
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables. Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals.  
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place. In addition, there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code.  
* A large part of the code in codeunit 12, approximately 30 percent, related to payment discount and tolerance calculations, although these features are not needed in many countries or regions.  
* Posting, Apply, Unapply, Reverse, Payment Discount and Tolerance, and Exchange Rate Adjustment were married together in codeunit 12 using a long list of global variables.  
  
### New Architecture  
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], codeunit 12 has had the following improvements:  
  
* Codeunit 12 has been refactored into smaller procedures (all less than 100 code lines).  
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables.  
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries, the collection of VAT adjustment, and the calculation of additional currency amounts.  
* Code duplication has been eliminated.  
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables.  
* The use of global variables has been minimized, so that each procedure uses parameters and encapsulates its own application logic.

# Setting Up Manufacturing

To convert material into produced end items, production resources, such as bills of material, routings, machine operators, and machinery must be set up in the system.

Operators and machines are represented in the system as machine centers that may be organized in work centers and work center groups. When these resources are established, they can be loaded with operations according to the item's defined material (BOM) and process (routing) structure, and according to the capacity of the machine or work center. You can also set the production capacity of each resource. Capacity is defined by the work time available in the machine and work centers, and is governed by calendars for each level. A work center calendar specifies the working days or hours, shifts, holidays, and absence that determine the work center's gross available capacity (typically measured in minutes). All of this is determined by defined efficiency and capacity values.  

When you have set up manufacturing, you can plan and execute production orders. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md) and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Set Up Shop Calendars

A work center or machine calendar specifies the working days and hours, shifts, holidays, and absences that determine the center’s gross available capacity, measured in time, according to its defined efficiency and capacity values.

As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar, you must first set up one or more general shop calendars. A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation. In addition, the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year.  

The following describes how to set up work center calendars. The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars.  

## To create work shifts  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Shifts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the work shift, for example, **1**.  
3.  Describe the work shift in the **Description** field, for example, **1st shift**.  
4.  Optionally, fill in lines for a second or third work shift.  

Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts, enter at least one work shift code.  

## To set up a shop calendar  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shop Calendars**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the shop calendar.  
3.  Describe the shop calendar in the **Description** field.  
4.  Choose the **Working Days** action.
5.  On the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page, define a complete work week, with the start and end times for each day.  

    In the **Work Shift Code** field, select one of the shifts that you previously defined. Add a line for every working day and every shift. For example:  

    Monday  07:00 15:00 1   
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  

    If you need a shop calendar with two work shifts, you must fill it in in this manner:  

    Monday 07:00 15:00 1   
    Monday 15:00 23:00 2  
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  
    Tuesday 15:00 23:00 2  

    Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar, such as Saturday and Sunday, are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

    When all the working days of a week are defined, you can close the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page and proceed to enter holidays.  

6.  On the **Shop Calendars** page, select the shop calendar, and then choose the **Holidays** action.
7. On the **Shop Calendar Holidays** page, define the holidays of the year by entering the start date and time, the end time, and description of each holiday on individual lines. For example:  

    04/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    05/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    06/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  

The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center.  

## To calculate a work center calendar  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the work center that you want to update.  
3. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select which shop calendar to use as the foundation for a work center calendar.  
4. Choose the **Calendar** action.  
5. On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.  

    The left side of the matrix page lists the work centers that are set up. The right side shows a calendar displaying the available capacity values for each working day in the defined unit of measure, for example, **480** minutes. Each line represents the calendar of one work center.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also select to view the capacity values for each week or month by changing the selection in the **View By** field on the **Work Center Calendar** page.  

    To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center, it must first be calculated.  

6.  Choose the **Calculate** action.  
7.  On the **Work Center** FastTab, you can set a filter to only calculate for one work center. If you do not set a filter, all existing work center calendars will be calculated.  
8.  Define the starting and ending dates of the calendar period that should be calculated, for example, one year from 01/01/14 to 31/12/14.
9. Choose the **OK** button to calculate capacity.  

Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data:  

- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar.  
- The value in the **Capacity** field on the work center card.  
- The value in the **Efficiency** field on the work center card.  

The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center. This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center.  

## To record work center absence  
1.  On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.
2. On the **Work Center Calendar Matrix** page, select the work center and calendar day when the absence time should be recorded, and then choose the **Absence** action.  
3.  On the **Absence** page, define the starting time, ending time, and description of that day’s absence. For example:  

    25/01/01 08:00 10:00 Maintenance  

4.  Choose the **Update** action, and then close the **Absence** page.  

The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time.

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Create Service Orders
You can use the **Service Order** page to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request.  

When creating a service order, you only have to fill in a few fields. Some fields are optional and many are automatically filled in when you fill in related fields.  

## To create a service order    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  

     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders on the **Service Management Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service order number.  

4. In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list. The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  

5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Management Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
7. Register the service item lines.  

## To create a service order from a contract  
You can automatically create service orders for the maintenance of service items based on service contracts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Contract Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Service Contract Header** FastTab, set the filters you want to apply.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields with the starting date and ending date for the period that you want to create contract service orders for. The batch job creates service orders that include service items in service contracts with next planned service dates within this period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There is a limit to the number of days you can use as the date range each time you use this batch job. You set this limit in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field on the **Service Management Setup** page.  

4. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Service Order**.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You will not be able to create order with multiple service item, if you set **One Service Item Line/Order** field on the **Service Management Setup** page. 

## To convert a service quote to a service order
When a customer has accepted a service quote, you convert it to a service order. The quote is deleted and a new service order is set up with the same description as the service quote. The response date and time are recalculated for the service order and the status is set to **Pending**. The repair status of the service items in the order are changed to **Initial**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for allocation entries for all the service items in the service quote that have the status **Active**. If it finds such allocation entries, their allocation status is updated to **Reallocation Needed**. When you reallocate the service items in the service order, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote are updated to **Finished**.   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service quote to convert to a service order.  
3. Choose the **Make Order** action.  

## To check item availability for one or more orders  
You can check and see if an item you need to fulfill an order is in stock, and if it is not, when the item will be in stock. In addition, if an item is available to reserve, you can reserve it to make sure it is available for your use. You can check availability for a particular order, or for all orders.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following:  

    * For a particular order, choose the order, and then choose the **Demand Overview** action.  
    * For all orders, choose **Show Document**. The **Service Order** page opens.  

3. On the **Demand Overview** page, expand the item grouping, and view information about the availability of the item. For example, you can see how many items are in inventory. You can also see if and when an item will be available if it is on back order, that is, Source Type = Purchase, or whether it has been reserved.

## To reserve an item for a service order
If you need to be sure that an item is available for a service order, you can reserve the item.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. On the **Service Lines** page, choose the item to reserve, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. On the **Reservation** page, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.

## To insert lines based on standard service codes  
If you have set up standard service codes and assigned them to service item groups, you can insert the standard lines linked to the standard service codes on service documents. For more information, see [Set Up Standard Service Codes](service-how-setup-service-coding.md).   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary..  
4. Fill in the service item lines with the required information.  
5. Choose the line with the service item that you want to create service lines for, and then choose **Get Std. Service Codes**. The **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page opens with the standard codes for the service item group specified on the line.  
6. Choose the appropriate code, and choose the **OK** button to enter standard service lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **Service Item Group Code** field on the service item line of the document is blank, this means that the service item does not belong to any service item group. In this case, the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page will contain a list of all standard service codes. You should select from the list to insert standard service lines in the document. You may also select from the list of standard service codes assigned to a specific service item group. To view the list, select the relevant code in the **Service Item Group Code** field on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page.  

## To register internal or public comments
You can add comments that will be printed on service orders and service quotes to provide additional information. You can add up to 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, choose another line. To register a comment, choose a line, and then choose the **Comments** action.  

## To delete invoiced service orders  
Orders are usually deleted automatically after having been fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. The posted document can be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoice** page.  

Service orders are not deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order has been posted not from the service order itself, but from the **Service Invoice** page. Then you may need to delete invoiced orders that were not deleted. You can do this by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Service Orders**, and then choose the related link. The **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job request page opens.  
2. To select the orders to be deleted, you can set filters in the **No.**, **Customer No.**, and **Bill-to Customer No.** fields.  
3. Choose **OK**.

# Make sales quotes

You create a sales quote to record your offer to a customer or a prospect to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can send the sales quote to the customer to communicate the offer. You can email the document as a PDF attachment. You can also have the email body prefilled with a summary of the quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).

While you negotiate with the customer or prospect, you can change and resend the sales quote as much as needed. When the customer accepts the quote, you convert the sales quote to a sales invoice or a sales order in which you process the sale. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

In most cases, you send sales quotes to prospective customers. You often have a contact person that you negotiate with. If they then accept your offer, you turn the sales quote into an order and register the prospect as a customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the following procedure, we focus on contacts, but you can also send quotes to existing customers.  

## To create a sales quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Specify the contact or customer that you want to send the sales quote to.

    - If the sales quote is for an existing contact, then specify the name in the **Contact No.** field.  

        If the sales quote is for an existing customer, specify the customer in the **Customer** field.
    - If the contact isn't registered, follow these steps:

        1. In the **Contact No.** field, choose the edit button :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false":::.
        2. In the dialog box about selecting the contact, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the relevant fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).  
        3. When you have completed the contact card, select the newly created contact in the list of contacts, and then choose the OK button to return to the sales quote.

        Several fields on the sales quote are now filled with information that you specified on the new contact card.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To correctly calculate taxes and prices for a quote, you must choose the relevant customer template in the **Customer Template Code** field. The template will be used to convert the contact to a customer once the quote is converted to a sales order or invoice.
    -  If the quote is for new customer, you must add the customer. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Quote** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    You're now ready to fill in the sales lines for products that you're selling or for any transaction with the customer or prospect that you want to record in a G/L account.  

    If you have set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you'll post for the customer with the sales line.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field empty in the following cases:
    - If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    - If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. For more information, see [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the item is of type **Service**, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. For more information, see [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* x *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, the price and amount on the sales line automatically update if the price criteria is met. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product you want to offer the contact.

    The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines.  
9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you have set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > To have the **Quote Valid Until Date** filled in automatically with a certain number of days after quote creation, you can fill in the **Quote Validity Calculation** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page.

10. When the sales quote lines are completed, choose the **Send by Email** action.
11. On the **Send Email** page, fill in any remaining fields and review the embedded sales quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).
12. If the contact accepts the quote, choose the **Make Order** action.  

    Alternatively, if your organization prefers that process, choose the **Make Invoice** action.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you added a customer in step 2, you'll be asked to confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.  
    >
    > If you added a contact from a prospective customer in step 2, you'll be asked to take the following steps:
    >
    >  - Convert the contact or prospect to a customer by choosing one of contact conversion templates. For more information, see [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  
    > - Confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.

The conversion removes the sales quote from the database. A sales invoice or a sales order is created based on the information in the sales quote so that you can process the sale. In the **Quote No.** field on the sales invoice or sales order, you can see the number of the sales quote that it was made from. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

# Set up work hours and service hours

Typically, a service management system tracks resource hours and service order status in order to forecast workloads and service needs. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in tools that you can customize to record this kind of information.  
  
After you set the default service hours of your company, you can calculate response times for service orders or send warnings or alerts when service calls come in. The alert feature is implemented together with the job scheduler.
  
As you work on a service order, update its status so that you can monitor progress. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order. For more information, see [Understanding Service Order and Repair Status](service-order-repair-status.md).

## To set up default service hours

You use the **Default Service Hours** page to set up the usual service working hours in your company. These service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes and to send response time warnings. The default service hours are used for service contracts unless you specify special service hours for a contract.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Service Hours**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you leave the lines on the **Default Service Hours** page empty, the default value is 24 hours, valid only for calendar working days.  
  
## To set up work hour templates

You can use the **Work Hour Template** page to set up templates that contain the working hours for different types of resources in your company. For example, you can create templates for full time technicians and part time technicians. You use work hour templates when you set capacity for resources. To learn more about setting capacity for a resource, go to [To set capacity for a resource](projects-how-setup-resources.md#to-set-capacity-for-a-resource).
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Hour Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!Note]
> After you enter work hours for each day, the value in the **Total per Week** field is calculated automatically.  

## To set up contract specific service hours

You can use the **Service Hours** page to set up specific service hours for the customer that owns the service contract. Service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes that belong to the service contract.  
  
If you don't set up specific service hours for the service contract, the default service hours for service contracts are used.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract you want to set up specific service hours for, and choose **Service Hours**.  
4. To set up service hours based on default service hours, choose the **Copy Default Service Hours** action.  
5. Edit the fields in the service hours entries. Insert or delete entries to set up the service hours for the contract. The fields **Day**, **Starting Time** and **Ending Time** are required for each line.  
6. If you want the service hours to be valid from a specific date, fill in the **Starting Date** field.  
7. If you want the service hours to be valid on holidays, select the check box in the **Valid on Holidays** field.

# Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In this article, you learn some of the basics about working with reports. Learn about viewing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (including scorecards and dashboards) and editing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. For general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, see [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports give you insight into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] include a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part that can display [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. The role center is a typical page where you find a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part. Some list pages, like **Items**, also include a Power BI part.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] works together with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Reports for displaying in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are stored in a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can switch the report displayed in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part to any Power BI report available in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. The first time you sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and until you connect to a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], parts are empty, as shown here:

![Power BI part in Business Central.](./media/power-bi-part.png)

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already set up to integrate with Power BI.

### Sign up Power BI

Before you can use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you need to sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If you didn't already sign up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

Once you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Learn more in [Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-sign-in). 

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] hosts all the reports available to you. To see a report in your personal workspace, select **My Workspace** > **Reports**. Then just select the report that you want to view. If you have access to one or more shared Power BI workspaces, you can also see reports in those workspaces.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you automatically get a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. Learn more in [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="connect"></a>Connect to Power BI - one time only

When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an empty [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part (as shown in the previous figure) is most likely available on various pages. The first thing to do is to connect to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account . Once connected, you can see reports. You only have to do this step once.

1. Select the **Get Started with Power BI** link in the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part.
2. The **Set Up [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in Business Central** assisted setup starts. Select **Next** to continue.
3. On the **Check your Power BI License** page, do one of the following steps:

    - If you didn't sign up for Power BI yet, select the [Go to Power BI homepage](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Sign up for an account, then come back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and finish the setup.

    - If you already have a license, select **Next**.
4. In the next page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will now upload a demo report to Power BI. This step takes a few minutes, so it runs in the background. To complete the setup, select **Next**, then **Finish**.

The connection process starts. During the process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] to determine if you have a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  and license. Once your license is verified, the default Power BI report displays on the page. If there a report isn't shown, you can select a report from the part.

> [!TIP]
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, this step automatically uploads default [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your Power BI workspace.

## <a name="apps"></a>Use Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview-table](includes/powerbi-apps-overview-table.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are free to install and use, the only requirement is that users need to have a non-free Power BI license. To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).


<!--#### From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Connecting to Power BI from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is similar to online. However, you might be prompted on the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page to grant access to [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. To grant access, select **Authorize Azure Services**, and then **Accept**.

Once connected, you can select a report from the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on pages.-->

## Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

### Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You want to make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*.  Depending on how your organization set up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand, as needed. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

#### Refresh manually

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

#### Schedule a refresh

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under Datasets, select More options (...) next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

Learn more in [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh)

### Show reports on list pages

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox on several key list pages. This FactBox provides extra insight into the data in the list. As you move between rows in the list, the report is updated and filtered for the selected entry.

To learn how to create reports for list pages, see [Creating [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the Power BI FactBox, it might be hidden on your workspace by personalization. Select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then select **Personalize** action. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
>
> Or if you have an older version of Business Central, go to the action bar, select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports**.

### Switch reports

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on a page can display any Power BI report that's available to you. To switch to view another report, choose the **Select Report** action from the drop-down command list at the top of the part.  

The **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page shows a list of all the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that you have access to. This list is retrieved from any of your own workspaces or workspaces that others shared with you in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Select the **Enable** box for each report that you want to display on the page, and then choose **OK**. You return to the page, and the last report you enabled appears. Using the drop-down command list, use the **Previous** and **Next** commands to navigate between reports.  

### Get more reports

If you don't see any reports on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page, or don't see the report you want, choose **Get Reports**. This action lets you look for reports from two locations: *My Organization* or from *Services*.

- Select **My Organization** to go to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. From here, you can view the reports within your organization that you have rights to view. You can then add them to your workspace.
- Select **Services** to go to Microsoft AppSource where you can install Power BI apps.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI Desktop, you can also create new [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. Then, once those reports are published to your Power BI workspace, they appear on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page.  

### Manage and modify reports

You can make changes to a report in the Power BI part. The changes that you make are then published to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If the report is shared with other users, they'll also see the changes, unless you save the changes to a new report.

To modify a report, choose the **Manage Report** action from the drop-down command list in the Power BI part. Then start making changes. Once you finish making changes, select **File** > **Save**. If it's a shared report, and you don't want to make the change for all users, select **Save As** to avoid making this change for all users.

When you return to the role center, the updated report appears. If you used **Save As**, you have to choose **Select Report**, and then enable the new report to see it.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

### <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have any .pbix files, you can upload and share them with all users of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reports are shared within each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

To upload a report, select the **Upload Report** action from the drop-down command list on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part. Then, locate the .pbix file that defines the reports that you want to share. You can change the default name of the file.  

After the report uploads to your Power BI workspace, it automatically uploads to other users' Power BI workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you have SUPER user permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You don't need any special permission to upload reports to your workspace through the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.
1. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. Learn more in [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). -->

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## <a name="share"></a>Share reports with others

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the sharing. Learn more in [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing requires that both you and the people you're sharing the report with have [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type). Otherwise, the content must be in [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). Learn more in [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).

## Fixing problems

However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account 

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  isn't set up for you. To get a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you must have a license, and you must have previously signed into Power BI to create a Power BI workspace.

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Choose Select Report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or it deployed but didn't refresh successfully. Navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

#### You can't see a report on the Select Report page on a list page

It's probably because the report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page. Clear the filter to get a full list of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports available.

# Service Price Management
The service price management functionality lets you apply the best price to service orders, set up personalized service price agreements for customers, improve service employees' efficiency, and accelerate the invoicing process.  
  
Service price management lets you set up different service price groups so you can consider the service item or service item group, in addition to the type of fault that the service task involves. You can set up these groups for a limited period of time, or for a specific customer or currency. You can use price calculation structures as templates to assign a specific price to a specific service task.  
  
For example, this makes it possible to assign specific items included in the service price, in addition to the type of work included. This also makes it possible to use different VAT and discount amounts for different service price groups. To make sure that the correct prices are applied, you can assign fixed, minimum, or maximum prices, depending on the agreements that you have with your customers.  
  
Before adjusting the price of a service item on a service order, you are provided with an overview of what the results of the price adjustment will be. You can approve of these results, or you can make additional changes, if you want to have a different result. The whole adjustment is performed line by line, which means that there are no additional lines created.  
  
Finally, service price group statistics and standard reports let you keep track of the profitability of each service price group.  
  
## Service Price Adjustment Groups  
You use service price adjustment groups to set up the different types of price adjustments for service lines. For example, you can set up a service price adjustment group that adjusts prices for spare parts, one that adjusts prices for labor, one that adjusts prices for costs, and so on. You can also specify whether the service price adjustment should be applied to just one specific item or resource, or to all items or resources.  
  
The service price adjustment function does not apply to service items under the following conditions:

* The item belongs to service contracts. You can only adjust the service prices of items that are part of a service order. 
* If the service item has a warranty. 
* If the service line has been posted as invoice, either fully or partially.  
  
When you run the service price adjustment function, all of the discounts in the order will be replaced by the values of the service price adjustment.  
  
## Service Price Groups  
You can set up service price groups to create groups of service items that receive the same special service pricing. When you have set up service price groups, you can then assign them to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  
  
Before you can assign a service price group to a service item, you have to determine to which fault area, currency, or service price adjustment group the service price group applies. You have to determine to which amount the service price should be adjusted, and whether this amount should include VAT and discounts. You also have to determine whether this adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or should only be applied under certain conditions.  
  
When you assign a service price group to a service item, all the special service pricing that you set up in this group will then apply for this service item.  
  
## Service Pricing  
You set up the actual types of service pricing (price adjustment type and price) for a combination of service price groups and customer price groups. For each type of service pricing, you select a service price adjustment group. You also specify the service price adjustment type, fixed, maximum, or minimum, and the actual price.  
  
For example, you can set up types of service pricing for a radio service price group. For customers without a price group, you can decide to have service pricing with maximum price on labor, which is the labor price adjustment group. For customers with a particular price group, you can decide to have service pricing with a fixed price on labor, the same labor price adjustment group.  

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service item, expand the **Prices and Sales** FastTab, choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

  
## Service Price Adjustment  
Service price adjustment lets you adjust the price of an item, resource, general ledger account, or cost on a service order.  
  
After you have entered an item on the service item line, you then enter all information about the costs of this item on the service lines. When you run the Adjust Service Price function, you can preview the price adjustments. You can make modifications if you have to. When you acknowledge the modifications, the adjustments are calculated, and are then transferred to the service lines. You then post the service order.  
  
Depending on the type of service price adjustment, the total amount of the adjustments is calculated.  
  
The following table describes the calculations.  
  
|Option | Description |  
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Price**|This means that you charge a fixed price for the service item, resource, general ledger account, or cost, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will reach the exact amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Maximum**|This means that you put an upper limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total price exceeds the amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Minimum**|This means that you put a lower limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total amount is less than the amount specified on the service price group.|

# Column definitions in Financial Reporting

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in a report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

## Create a new column definition

To create a new column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Provide a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description** field, provide a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Provide an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a column definition

To edit the content of a column definition, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Printed, previewed, and saved versions of a financial report display a maximum of five columns. In contrast, if a financial report is only meant for analysis on the **Financial Report** page, you can create as many columns as you want.

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. On the **Column Definition** page, create a row for each column of financial data that should show in the financial report. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> Open the **Financial Report** page from time to time to verify that the new column definition works as intended.

## Built-in column definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample column definitions that can help you to quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Column definition code | Description | How to use this column definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 |
-->

## Example: Create a column definition to calculate percentages

You might want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. For example, if you have rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales in each row.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentages are based.  
1. Add a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: 
    1. In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**. 
    1. In the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage is based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.  
1. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows. 
    1. In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**. 
    1. In the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percentage sign (%). So, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.  
1. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## Comparing accounting periods using period formulas

Your financial report can compare the results of different accounting periods, such as the past month versus the same month last year. To do that, open the **Column Definition** page, and personalize it by adding the **Comparison Period Formula** field as a column. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). You can then set that field to a period formula.  

An accounting period doesn't need to match the calendar. However, each fiscal year must have the same number of accounting periods, although each period can be different in length.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the period formula to calculate the duration of the comparison period in relation to the period represented by the date filter on the report. The comparison period is based on the period of the start date of the date filter. The following table shows the abbreviations for period specifications.

| Abbreviation | Description                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P            | Period.                                                                                |
| LP           | Last period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter.                                   |
| CP           | Current period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter. Use CP in formulas to set the period that starts or ends the formula. For example, FY\[1..CP\] denotes the time from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the current period.|
| FY           | Fiscal year. For example, FY\[1..3\] denotes the first quarter of the current fiscal year. |

Examples of formulas:

| Formula | Description |
|-----|-----|
| \<Blank\>       | Current period. |
| \-1P            | Previous period.            |
| \-1FY\[1..LP\]  | Entire previous fiscal year.                  |
| \-1FY           | Current period in previous fiscal year.       |
| \-1FY\[1..3\]   | First quarter of previous fiscal year.        |
| \-1FY\[1..CP\]  | From the beginning of the previous fiscal year to the current period in the previous fiscal year, including both periods. |
| \-1FY\[CP..LP\] | From the current period in previous fiscal year to the last period of the previous fiscal year, including both periods.   |

To calculate by regular time periods, enter a formula in the **Comparison Date Formula** field instead. For example, if the field is set to -1Y, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compares to the same period one year earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> It isn't always obvious which periods you're comparing because you can set a date filter on a report that spans dates that are different than the accounting periods in your chart of accounts. So, if you create a financial report where you want to compare this period to the same period last year, set the **Comparison Date Formula** field to **-1FY**. Then, run the report on **February 28th** and set the date filter to **January and February**. As a result, the financial report compares January and February this year to January last year, which is the only completed accounting period of the two for last year.  

Learn more at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Find the reports that use a column definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a column definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with column definitions

<!-- [!INCLUDE [report-best-practices-column-defs](includes/report-best-practices-column-defs2.md)] -->

## Import or export financial report column definitions

Starting with the 2024 release wave 1 (version 24.1), you can import and export financial report column definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report column definitions, they replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report column definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Column Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, and then choose the **Import Column Definition** or **Export Column Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Create analysis reports

Sales managers need to analyze turnover, gross profit, and other key sales performance indicators regularly. Purchasers are more interested in the dynamics of purchase volumes, vendor performance, and purchase prices. Whereas logistics/inventory managers need information on inventory turnover, analysis of inventory movement, and statistics on inventory value. So there's no one-size-fits-all analysis report.

You can customize analysis reports based on records of your posted transactions, for example, sales, purchases, transfers, and inventory adjustments. In a customizable report, the source data, which is derived from the item ledger (with associated value entries), can be combined, compared, and presented in meaningful user-defined ways. In this sense, the analysis report is similar to a PivotTable report in Microsoft Excel.  

So, for example, you can create a personalized report that focuses on your key accounts in terms of total product turnover in amounts and quantities sold, gross profit, and gross profit percentage during the current month. Then you can have it compare those figures with the results from previous months or the same month last year, and calculate deviations. All this can be done in one and the same view, enabling you to navigate to the cause of identified problem areas and even choose the drop-down to zero in on details all the way down to the level of individual transactions.  

The analysis report consists of the objects you want to analyze (such as customers, customer groups, sales people, and so on, represented as lines) and the analysis parameters, which is the way you want to analyze the object (such as profit calculations, periodic comparisons of sales amounts and volumes or periodic comparisons of actual and budgeted figures, represented as columns). 

In addition to analysis reports, you can create and view similar information in analysis views (based on dimensions). Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Example

You can set up these lines (objects you want to analyze):  

- Computers  
- Displays  
- Spare Parts  

Then you can set up these columns (how you want the objects analyzed):  

- Sales Current Month  
- Sales Last Month  
- Sales in Pct. of last Month  

## Setting up line and column layouts

On the **Analysis Report** page, you can view different line and column layouts that you set up on the:

* **Analysis Line Templates** page where you define the name of the report and the objects you want to show in the lines of your report, and the
* **Analysis Column Templates** page where you define the name of the column template and the analysis parameters that show in the report as columns. Each line on this page represents a column in your report. 

Note that analysis lines and analysis columns are independent from each other.  

Based on the lines and columns you set up, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aggregates the result of your report in the **Analysis Report** page, as shown in the following table.  

|- |Sales Current Month|Sales Last Month|Sales Last Month %|  
|-|-|-|-|  
|Computers| | | |  
|Displays| | | |  
|Spare parts| | | |  
|Total| | | |  

You can, for example, set up one group of lines and several groups of column layouts to show monthly and annual reports, respectively.

## Set up analysis column templates

The following procedure is based on sales analysis views. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis views.

An analysis column template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis column you want in the analysis report. To define a column, you must assign an analysis type code to a line. This analysis type code determines the type of source data in the item ledger entries that the analysis will be based on. Source data can include cost, sales amount, or quantity, and their associated value entries. You can set up as many column templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Column Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Columns** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Columns** page, fill the fields in to specify the columns you want in your analysis report.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To define a column, you must fill in the **Analysis Type Codes** field for all column types except **Formula**. Set up the analysis type codes on the **Analysis Types** page.  
    >
    > Also, in the **Ledger Entry Type** field, if you select **Item Entries**, the actual figures from the item ledger entry are copied. If you select **Item Budget Entries**, the budgeted figures from the budget are copied.  
5. Choose **OK** to save your changes.  

## Set up analysis line templates

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

An analysis line template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis line you want in the analysis report. A line can specify one or a range of items, customers, vendors, or groups. You can also create a formula in a line to sum up the other lines. You can set up as many line templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Line Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Lines** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Lines** page, create lines for the items, customers, vendors, or salespeople you want to view figures for in your analysis report. You must fill in the **Type**, **Range**, and the **Description** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, to create many individual lines for each item, customer, and so on, you can select the appropriate insert option to fill in all the relevant fields on the line. If you need to, you can then edit the lines manually. To insert lines, choose the **Insert Items** or **Insert Item Groups** action.  

## Create a new sales analysis report

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

With analysis reports you can analyze the dynamics of your sales according to key sales performance indicators, such as sales turnover in both amounts and quantities, contribution margin, or progress of actual sales against the budget. You can also use analysis reports to analyze your average sales prices and evaluate the sales performance of your sales force.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Analysis Reports**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis Report Sale** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Edit Analysis Report** action.
5. On the **Sales Analysis Report** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action  

> [!NOTE]  
> Building combinations of line and column templates to create reports and assigning them unique names is optional. If you do this, you won't need to select line and column templates on the **Sales Analysis Report** page. After you have chosen a report name, you can change line and column templates independently and then later select the report name again to restore the original combination.

# Count and adjust inventory using documents

You can take a physical inventory of your items by using physical inventory order and physical inventory recording documents. The **Physical Inventory Order** page is used to organize the complete inventory counting project, for example one per location. Use the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page capture and communicate the actual count of items. You can create multiple recordings for one order, for example, to distribute groups of items to different employees.

You can print the **Physical Invt. Recording** report from each recording, and it contains empty quantity fields where you can enter the counted inventory. When you're done counting and the quantities are entered on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page, choose the **Finish** action. This action transfers the quantities to the related lines on the **Physical Inventory Order** page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]ensures that you can't record an item count twice.  

> [!NOTE]
> Using documents to perform a physical inventory count provides more control and supports distributing the counting to multiple employees. You can also use journals to perform the task, such as the **Phys. Inventory Journals** and **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journals** pages. To learn more, go to [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md). This article describes how to use documents to do a physical inventory count.
>
> If you're using zones in your warehouse, you can't use physical inventory orders. Instead, use the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page to count your warehouse entries before you synchronize them with item ledger entries.

Counting inventory by using documents consists of the following overall steps:

1. Create a physical inventory order with expected item quantities prefilled.
2. Generate one or more physical inventory recordings from the order.
3. Enter the counted item quantities on the recordings, as captured on print-outs, for example, and set it to **Finished**.
4. Complete and post the physical inventory order.

## To create a physical inventory order

A physical inventory order is a complete document that consists of a physical inventory order header and order lines. The information on a physical inventory header describes how to take the physical inventory. The order lines contain the information about the items and their locations.

To create the physical inventory order lines, you typically use the **Calculate Lines** action to add the current inventory as lines on the order. You can also use the **Copy from Document** action to fill in the lines with the content of another open or posted physical inventory order. The following procedure only describes how to use the **Calculate Lines** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the required fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Calculate Lines**.
5. Select options as necessary.
6. Set filters, for example, to only include a subset of items to count with the first recording.

    > [!TIP]
    > To plan for multiple employees to count the inventory, set different filters each time you use the **Calculate Lines** action to fill in the order with the subset of inventory items that a user will record. Then, as you generate multiple physical inventory recordings for multiple employees, you minimize the risk of counting items twice. To learn more, go to [To create a physical inventory recording](#to-create-a-physical-inventory-recording).

7. Choose the **OK** button.

A line for each item that exists on the chosen location and per the set filters and options is added to the order. For items that are set up for item tracking, the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected and information about the expected quantity of serial and lot numbers is available by choosing **Lines**, and then **Item Tracking Lines**. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).

You can now create one or more recordings, which are instructions to the employees who do the counting.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use package-specific tracking, you can also use documents to count and adjust inventory with package numbers. To start using this feature, you must turn on **Feature Update: Enable use of package tracking in physical inventory orders** on the **Feature Management** page. Existing physical inventory orders are updated, however, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't populate the **Package No.** field. You must recreate these lines using the **Calculate Lines** action on the **Physical Inventory Order** page.
>
> You can enter the package number for items where package tracking is needed on the **Phys. Inventory Recording Lines** page. Choose **Finish** to finalize recording.
>
> After you choose **Finish** on the **Physical Inventory Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates differences with respect to the package and other item tracking details, and makes positive or negative adjustments.

## To create a physical inventory recording

For each physical inventory order, you can create one or more physical inventory recording documents on which employees enter the counted quantities. Employees can enter quantities either manually, or with a scanning device.

By default, a recording is created for all the lines on the related physical inventory order. To avoid that two employees count the same items if you distribute counting, gradually fill in the physical inventory order by setting filters on the **Calculate Lines** batch job. Then create the physical inventory recording with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected. This setting ensures that each new recording contains different items than those on other recordings.

For manual counting, you can print the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report, which has an empty column where warehouse employees can write the counted quantities. When counting is complete, you enter the recorded quantities on the related lines on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page. Lastly, you transfer the recorded quantities to the related physical inventory order by setting the status to **Finished**.

1. On a **Physical Inventory Order** page that contains lines for the items to be counted in one recording, you need to choose the **Make New Recording** action.
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Make New Recording**.
1. Select options and set filters as necessary.
1. Choose the **OK** button.
1. For every set of items to be counted, load them on the related physical inventory order and repeat steps 1 through 3 with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to open the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page.
1. Open the relevant recording.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
1. For items that use item tracking, create an additional line for each lot number or serial number code by choosing the **Functions** action, and then the **Copy Line** action. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).  
1. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the physical document that employees can use to note the quantities they count.

## To finish a physical inventory recording

After employees count the quantities, record the quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. From the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page, select the physical inventory recording that you want to finish, and then choose the **Edit** action.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the actual counted quantity in the **Quantity** field for each line.
3. For items with serial or lot numbers (the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected), enter the counted quantities on the lines for the item's serial and lot numbers respectively. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).
4. Select the **Recorded** checkbox on each line.
5. When you have entered all data for a physical inventory recording, choose the **Finish** action. Note that all lines must have the **Recorded** checkbox selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you finish a physical inventory recording, each line is transferred to the line on the related physical inventory order that matches it exactly. To match, the values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields must be the same on the recording and the order lines.>
    > 
    > If a matching physical inventory order line doesn't exist, and if the **Allow Recording Without Order** checkbox is selected, a new line is added and the **Recorded Without Order** checkbox on the related physical inventory order line is selected. Otherwise, an error message displays and the process is canceled.>
    > If more than one physical inventory recording lines match a physical inventory order line, then a message displays and the process is canceled. If, for some reason, two identical physical inventory lines end up on the physical inventory order, you can use a action to resolve it. To learn more, go to [To find duplicate physical inventory order lines](#to-find-duplicate-physical-inventory-order-lines).

## To complete a physical inventory order

After you finish a physical inventory recording, the **Qty. Recorder (Base)** field on the related physical inventory order is updated with the counted (recorded) values, and the **On Recording Lines** checkbox is selected. If a counted quantity differs from the expected quantity, the **Pos Qty. (Base)** and **Neg Qty. (Base)** fields show the difference.

To access the expected quantities and any recorded differences for items with item tracking, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose **Item Tracking Lines** to select various views for the serial and lot numbers in the physical inventory count.

You can also choose the **Phys. Inventory Order Diff.** action to view any differences between the expected quantity and the counted quantity.

### To find duplicate physical inventory order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the physical inventory order to view duplicate lines for.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Other**, and then choose **Show Duplicate Lines**.

Duplicate physical inventory order lines display so that you can delete them and keep only one line with a unique set of values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields.

### To post a physical inventory order

After you complete a physical inventory order and change its status to **Finished**, you can post it. You can only set the status of a physical inventory order to **Finished** under the following conditions:

- All related physical inventory recordings have a status of **Finished**.
- Each physical inventory order line is counted by at least one inventory recording line.
- The **In Recording Lines** and the **Qty. Exp. Calculated** checkboxes are selected for all physical inventory order lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the physical inventory order that you want to complete, and then choose the **Edit** action.

    On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the quantity recorded shows in the **Qty. Recorded (Base)** field.
3. Choose the **Finish** action.

    The value in the **Status** field is **Finished**. You can now only change the order by choosing the **Reopen** action.
4. To post the order, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The item ledger entries are updated along with any related item tracking entries.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

### To view posted physical inventory orders

After posting, the physical inventory order is deleted and you can view and evaluate the document as a posted physical inventory order. The posted order includes its physical inventory recordings and any comments made.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders** page, select the posted inventory order to view, and then choose the **View** action.
3. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to view a list of related physical inventory recordings.  

## Handle item tracking when counting inventory

Item tracking relates to the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to items. When you count an item that's stored in inventory as, for example, 10 different lot numbers, employee must be able to record which and how many units of each lot number are on inventory. To learn more, go to [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

The **Use Item Tracking** checkbox on physical inventory order lines is automatically selected if an item tracking code is set up for the item. You can select or clear the checkbox manually.

### Example - Prepare a physical inventory recording for an item-tracked item

Consider a physical inventory for Item A, which is stored in inventory as ten different serial numbers.

1. On the recording line for the item, select the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox.
2. Choose the **Serial No.** field, select the first serial number that exists in inventory for the item, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Copy the line for the first item-tracked item to insert additional lines that correspond to the number of serial numbers that are stored in inventory.

3. Choose the **Functions** action, and then choose **Copy Line**.
4. On the **Copy Phys. Invt. Rec. Line** page, enter **9** in the **No. of Copies** field, and then choose the **OK** button.
5. On the first line, in the **Serial No.** field, select the next serial number for the item.
6. Repeat step 5 for the remaining eight serial numbers. Be sure you don't select the same number twice.
7. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the print-out that employees use to write down the counted items and serial/lot numbers.

Notice that the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report contains ten lines for Item A, one for each serial number.

### Example - Record and post counted lot number differences

A lot-tracked item is stored in inventory with the "LOT" number series.

**Expected Inventory**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT1003|30|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|120|

**Recorded Quantities**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT0002|12|
|LOT1003|20|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|112|

**Quantities to Post**:

|Lot No.|Expected Quantity|Recorded Quantity|Quantity to Post|
|-|-|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|80|0|
|LOT1002|0|12|+12|
|LOT1003|30|20|-10|
|LOT1006|10|0|-10|
|Total|120|112|-8|

On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the **Neg. Qty. (Base)** field contains **8**. For the order line, the **Phys. Invt. Item Track. List** page shows the positive or negative quantities for each lot number.

## Inventory documents

The following types of documents are useful for managing your warehouse:

* Use **inventory receipts** to register positive adjustments of items based on the quality, quantity, and cost.
* Use **inventory shipments** to write off missing or damaged goods.

You can print these documents at any stage, release, and reopen them, and assign common values such as dimensions in the header. To reprint the documents after they're posted, use the **Posted Inventory Receipt** and **Posted Inventory Shipment** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use these documents, you must specify a number series to create their identifiers. To learn more, go to [To set up numbering for inventory documents](#to-set-up-numbering-for-inventory-documents).

### To set up numbering for inventory documents

The following procedure shows how to set up numbering for inventory documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify in the following fields the series of numbers for documents:

   - **Invt. Receipt Nos.**  
   - **Posted Invt. Receipt Nos.**  
   - **Invt. Shipment Nos.**  
   - **Posted Invt. Shipment Nos.**  

### To create and post an inventory document

The following procedure shows how to create, print, and post an inventory receipt. The steps are similar for inventory shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the header of the **Invt. Receipt** page, choose the location in the **Location Code** field, and then fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item** field, choose the inventory item. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to add.
4. To print an **Inventory Receipt** report from the **Invt. Receipt** page, choose the **Print** action.

The following functions are available on the **Invt. Receipt** page:

- Choose the **Release** or **Reopen** actions to set the status for the next processing stage.  
- Choose the **Post** action to post the inventory receipt, or choose **Post and Print** to post the receipt and print the test report.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## Printing inventory documents

You can specify the reports that must be printed at different stages by choosing one of the following options in the **Usage** field the **Report Selection - Inventory** page:

* Inventory Receipt
* Inventory Shipment
* Posted Inventory Receipt
* Posted Inventory Shipment

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Actual (Total Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-total-price)
- [**Billable (Invoiced Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#billable-invoiced-price)
- [**Realization %**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-)

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:

# Procurement Quick Start

To be able to buy products and services, you must first set up vendors. Once that is done, you can start registering purchase orders and receiving invoices.  

## Set up vendors

The following video shows you how to set up a vendor in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

### Set up a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when you register vendors, see [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  

## Create new purchase orders

When you buy something from a vendor you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a purchase invoice. However, you must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity was not available at the vendor.

The following video shows you how to create a purchase order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=f04b1ed3-5cb0-4fa8-8cd0-24069ee893d2]

### To create a purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Order.

3. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Header** are now filled with the standard information about the selected vendor.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase order lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Order Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the order.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase order, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md).  

## Create a purchase invoice  

You create a purchase invoice to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Creating a purchase invoice is similar to creating a purchase order.

### How to create and post a purchase invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Invoice** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Invoice.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected vendor.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase invoice, see [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Manage inventory

For each physical product you trade in, you must create an item card of the **Inventory** type. Items you offer to customers but don't keep in inventory you can register as catalog items, which you can convert to inventory items when necessary. You can increase or decrease the quantity of an item in inventory by posting directly to the item ledger entries, such as after a physical count or if you don't record purchases.

Inventory increases and decreases are naturally also recorded when you post purchase and sales documents, respectively. To learn more, go to [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md), and [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). Transfers between locations change inventory quantities across your company's warehouses.

To enhance your overview of items and to help you find them, you can categorize items and give them attributes to search and sort by.

> [!NOTE]
> The physical handling of items is referred to as warehouse activities. Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

Planning for items to fulfill demand is covered as part of supply planning functionality. Learn more at [Planning](production-planning.md).

## Inventory reconciliation

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change in inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs are automatically posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger. For each inventory transaction you post, the appropriate values are posted to the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).

Even though inventory costs are automatically posted to the general ledger, it's still necessary to ensure that the costs of goods are forwarded to the related outbound sales transaction, especially in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. This is referred to as cost adjustment. Item costs are automatically adjusted when you post item transactions, but you can also adjust item costs manually. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.
  * Document Date
  * Sell-to Customer No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Approval workflow notifications

Set up your workflows to automatically notify users when their attention is required for a step in a workflow. Many workflow responses involve notifying a user an event they must act on has occurred.

For example, you can set it so User 2, the approver user, receives a notification whenever User 1 requests approval for a new record. On the next workflow step, after User 2 approves the record, User 3 is notified and can begin a related processing of the record. With approval workflow steps, each notification is tied to an approval entry. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports notifications in email or as internal notes.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All workflow notifications are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue in your installation is set up to handle workflow notifications, and that you've selected the **Start Automatically From Server** check box. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Set up notifications

You can set up different aspects of workflow notifications in the following places:  

* Approver notification

  For approval workflows, set up the recipients of workflow notifications by filling in a line on the **Approval User Setup** page for each user that takes part in the workflow.  

  For example, if User 2 is specified in the **Approver ID** field on the line for User 1, then the approval request notification is sent to User 2. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md). 
  
* Notification schedules

  Set up when and how users receive workflow notifications by filling in the **Notification Schedule** page for each workflow user. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md). 
  
* Customize the email notifications

  If you like, you can customize the content of the email notification by modifying Report 1320, Notification Email. Learn more at [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you want to use email as the notification method, you must set up email for both the sender and the receiver in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).
  
* Response options

  Set up specific content for and rules of a workflow notification when you create the workflow in question. Select the customization options on the **Workflow Responses** page for the workflow response that represents the notification. Learn more from step 9 in the [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md#to-create-a-workflow) section. 
  
* Notify sender

  For approval workflows, add a workflow response step to notify the sender when the request has been approved or rejected. Learn more from step 9 in the [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md#to-create-a-workflow) section.

# [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides executives, purchasing managers, and procurement teams with valuable insights into purchasing activities. This app can help you streamline purchasing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize spending by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of purchasing data. Use its reports to increase transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in your daily operations.

## Purchases analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Procurement Officer

### Example scenario: preparing purchasing budgets

As the CEO of a manufacturing company, you need to stay on top of rising raw material costs to maintain profitability. For the leadership team, it's important to understand your organization's spending. The [Purchases Overview](purchases-powerbi-purchases-overview.md) and [Moving Annual Total](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md) reports can give you a better understanding of how much money you spend on purchasing activities and quickly spot increases in raw material costs.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the key metrics on the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png":::

You can also use the [Actual and Budget](purchases-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report to monitor the actual spending against the allocated budget. This comparison helps you make informed decisions to plan ahead for the coming months and years, giving you better budget control.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Actual vs. Budget matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png":::

## Purchases analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: reducing raw material costs

Purchase Managers in manufacturing ensure they have the materials they need to meet production demands. You notice an increase in the cost of a material, which could affect profitability. Using the [Purchases Decomposition](purchases-powerbi-purchases-decomposition.md) and [Purchases by Item](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-item.md) reports, you can quickly identify the vendor that provides the material and analyze the purchase amount compared to the previous year. This information can help you negotiate better prices with the vendor.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Amount by Item Category bar chart" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png":::

To monitor purchasing activities and ensure compliance with weekly or monthly budgets, the [Daily Purchases](purchases-powerbi-daily-purchases.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of purchase amounts. It aggregates amounts by day, week, month, and year. Use this report to spot unexpected spikes in spending and take corrective action before it affects your budget.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png":::

Also, you can use the [Moving Averages](purchases-powerbi-moving-averages.md) report to analyze purchasing trends and identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The **Purchases by Location** report can help you find discrepancies in purchasing patterns across different locations and make decisions.

## Purchases analytics for daily purchasing work

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Agent
- Purchasing Officer

### Example scenario: selecting vendors for purchasing raw materials

As a purchaser for a manufacturing company, you source materials for production. Part of your role is to keep purchasing costs under control to maintain profitability in the allocated budget. Use the **Purchases by Item** report to see the breakdown of purchases by item and category.

You notice that the company spent significantly on a particular category of materials. The purchase amount increased compared to the previous year. You decide to investigate by looking at the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report, which shows the breakdown of purchases by vendor.

You identify that one vendor consistently provided the materials at a higher price than other vendors. To analyze spending and manage your supplier relationship, use the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report. The report shows the purchasing activities for each vendor, including the amount spent, the number of transactions, and the vendors that supplied a specific category of material.

# Sustainability certificates

In today’s business landscape, sustainability is more than a trend - it’s a necessity. As companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and meet growing consumer demand for responsible practices, sustainability certificates are now an essential tool for validating these efforts. These certificates serve as an independent verification that a company or its products meet specific environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, fostering trust and transparency in the marketplace.  

Sustainability certificates offer a clear and measurable way to assess the environmental and ethical credentials of both companies and their products. By prioritizing vendors who hold recognized sustainability certifications, businesses can enhance their supply chain integrity, reduce risks, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Sustainability certificates for companies cover a wide range of criteria, including resource efficiency, waste management, emissions reduction, and social responsibility. Similarly for products, these certifications ensure that items meet stringent environmental standards, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal. 

## Sustainability certificate area 

The *sustainability certificate area* refers to the specific area covered by a particular certificate. Generally, this method is used to categorize similar certificates based on distinct characteristics. To create new sustainability certificate area, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Areas**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Areas** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate area. 
3. Close the page.   

## Sustainability certificate standards

The *Sustainability certificate standard* refers to the specific standard for a particular certificate. Generally, it should provide third-party verified, transparent, and measurable criteria aligned with international ESG frameworks to promote responsible business practices. To create new sustainability certificate standard, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Standards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Standards** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate standard. 
3. Close the page.  

## Create a sustainability certificate 

To create a new sustainability certificate, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Certificates**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Certificates** page, select **New**.
3. In the **Type** field, choose if this certificate is related to vendors or items, and enter the **No.** and **Name** fields.
4. In the **Area** field, choose specific **Sust. Certificate Area** option and in the **Standard** field, choose adequate **Sust. Certificate Standard**.
5. In the **Issuer** field, specify the issuer name. 
Sustainability certificates are typically issued by independent third-party organizations, which can include non-profit certifying bodies, industry associations, standards organizations, or specialized sustainability certification firms. The issuers are responsible for assessing compliance with established sustainability standards.
1. If this certificate has a measurable value, enable the **Has Value** field and enter the **Value**.

# Design details: average cost

The average cost of an item is calculated with a periodic weighted average. The average is based on the average cost period you have specified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The valuation date is set automatically.  

## Setting up average cost calculation

The following table describes the two fields on the **Inventory Setup** page that must be filled to enable average cost calculation.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Average Cost Period**|Specifies which period the average cost is calculated in. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Day**<br />- **Week**<br />- **Month**<br />- **Accounting Period**<br /><br /> Inventory decreases that are posted in the average cost period get the average cost calculated for that period.|  
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Specifies how the average cost is calculated. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Item**<br />- **Item, Variant, and Location**<br /> With this option, the average cost is calculated for each item, for each location, and for each variant of the item. The average cost of this item depends on where you store it and the variant you select, such as color.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use one average cost period and one average cost calculation type in a fiscal year.  
>
> The **Accounting Periods** page shows which average cost period and which average cost calculation type is in effect during that period, for each accounting period.  

## Calculating average cost

 When you post a transaction for an item that uses the Average costing method, an entry is created in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table. This entry contains the transaction’s item number, variant code, and location code. The entry also contains the **Valuation Date** field, which specifies the last date of the average cost period in which the transaction was posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This field should not be confused with the **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table, which shows the date when the value takes effect and is used to determine the average cost period in which the value entry belongs.  

 The average cost of a transaction is calculated when the item’s cost is adjusted. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md). A cost adjustment uses the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table to identify which items (or items, locations, and variants) to calculate average costs for. For each entry with a cost that hasn't been adjusted, the cost adjustment uses the following to determine the average cost:  

- Determines the cost of the item at the start of the average cost period.  
- Adds the sum of the inbound costs that were posted during the average cost period. These include purchases, sales returns, positive adjustments, and production and assembly outputs.  
- Subtracts the sum of the costs of any outbound transactions that were fixed-applied to receipts in the average cost period. These typically include purchase returns and negative outputs.  
- Divides by the total inventory quantity for the end of the average cost period. Excludes inventory decreases that are being valued.  

 The calculated average cost is then applied to the inventory decreases for the item (or item, location, and variant) with posting dates in the average cost period. For inventory increases that are fixed-applied to inventory decreases in the average cost period, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] forwards the calculated average cost from the increase to the decrease.  

### Example: average cost period = day

The following example shows the effect of calculating average cost based on an average cost period of one day. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page is set to **Item**.  

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not yet occurred, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

 The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-02-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-03-23 |   No |

 The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per day is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

### Example: average cost period = month

 This example shows the effect of calculating the average cost based on an average cost period of one month. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page  is set to **Item**.  

 If the average cost period is one month, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates one entry for each combination of item number, variant code, location code, and valuation date.  

 The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not occurred yet, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-31-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-28-23 |   No |

> [!NOTE]  
> The valuation date is set to the last day in the average cost period, which in this case is the last day of the month.  

The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per month is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

|**Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 | Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 6 |

The average cost of entry number 3 is calculated in the average cost period for January. The average cost for entries 4 and 6 is calculated in the average cost period for February.  

To get the average cost for February, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the average cost of the item received in inventory (100.00) to the average cost at the beginning of the period (30.00). The sum (130.00) is then divided by the total quantity in inventory (2). This calculation gives the resulting average cost of the item in the February period (65.00). The average cost is assigned to the inventory decreases in the period (entries 4 and 6).  

## Setting the valuation date

 The **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table determines the average cost period in which an inventory decrease entry belongs. This setting also applies to work in process (WIP) inventory.  

 The following table shows the criteria that are used to set the valuation date.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Valued Quantity | Revaluation | Valuation Date |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 |  | Positive | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 2 | Later than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Negative | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 3 | Earlier than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Positive | No | Latest valuation date of the applied value entries |
| 4 |  | Negative | Yes | Posting date of the revaluation value entry |

### Example

The following table of value entries illustrates the different scenarios.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Item Ledger Entry Type | Valuation Date | Valued Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry No. | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 01-01-20 | Purchase | 01-01-20 | 2 | 20.00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 01-15-20 | (Item Charge) | 01-01-20 | 2 | 8.00 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 02-01-20 | -1 | -14.00 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 03-01-20 | (Revaluation) | 03-01-20 | 1 | -.4.00 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 03-01-20 | -1 | -10.00 | 3 | 5 |

> [!NOTE]  
> In entry number 5 in the preceding table, the user has entered a sales order with a posting date (02-01-20) that comes before the latest valuation date of applied value entries (03-01-20). If the corresponding value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for this date (02-01-20) were used for this entry, then it would be 14.00. This would give a situation where the quantity on inventory is zero, but the inventory value is –4.00.  
>
> To avoid such a quantity-value mismatch, the valuation date is set to equal the latest valuation date of the applied value entries (03-01-20). The value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field becomes 10.00 (after revaluation), which means that the quantity on inventory is zero, and the inventory value is also zero.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Because the **Inventory Valuation** report is based on posting date, the report will reflect any quantity-value mismatches in scenarios as in the above example. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Valuation](design-details-inventory-valuation.md).  

If the quantity on inventory is less than zero after you post the inventory decrease, the valuation date is set to the posting date of the inventory decrease. You can change this date when the inventory increase is applied, according to the rules described in the note earlier in this section.  

## Recalculating average cost

Valuing inventory decreases as a weighted average would be straightforward in several scenarios:

- Purchases are always invoiced before sales.
- Postings are never backdated.
- You never made mistakes.

However, the reality is different.  

As the examples in this article illustrate, the valuation date is defined as the date from which the value entry is included in the average cost calculation. This setting lets you do several things for items with the Average costing method:  

- Invoice the sale of an item before you invoice its purchase.  
- Backdate a posting.  
- Recover an incorrect posting.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Another reason for this flexibility is fixed application. For more information about fixed application, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

Because of this flexibility, you might have to recalculate the average cost after posting. For example, if you post an inventory increase or decrease with a valuation date that's before an inventory decrease. The recalculation of the average cost occurs automatically when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, manually or automatically.  

You can change the inventory valuation base within an accounting period by changing the values in the **Average Cost Period** and **Average Cost Calc. Type** fields. However, we recommend that you use caution and consult your auditor.  

### Example of recalculated average cost

This example shows how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the average cost when you post on a date that's before an inventory decrease. The example is based on an average cost period of **Day**.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item before the posting is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 4 |

The user posts an inventory increase (entry number 5) with a valuation date (01-03-20) that's before an inventory decrease. To balance the inventory, the average cost must be recalculated and adjusted to 17.00.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item after entry number 5 is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 01-03-20 | 1 | 21.00 | 5 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 4 |

# Setting Up Troubleshooting for Service Items
You can set up troubleshooting guidelines that help technicians solve problems when providing service. For example, guidelines might be a list of steps to perform a repair, or a series of questions to ask about the items. After you set up troubleshooting guidelines, you can assign them to service item groups, service items, and items. There is an inheritance hierarchy for guidelines. If you assign them to a service item group, the items included in the group will inherit the guidelines unless you specify them for the items. Similarly, service items will inherit guidelines from items.  

## To set up troubleshooting guidelines
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Troubleshooting**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign troubleshooting guidelines to items, service items, or service item groups
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, **Service Items**, or **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant entity, and then choose the **Troubleshooting** action.

# Service Posting
Service posting functionality lets you process your documents efficiently and maintain successful customer service policy. You can create and update posted documents, and create ledger entries both in the service area and in other modules to ensure the correct update.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The following describes service posting regardless of how items are physically handled in the warehouse.  
>   
>  In a location that is not set up to require warehouse handling, you perform the posting actions directly from the **Service Lines** page. In locations that involve warehouse handling, the described posting actions, except Ship and Consume, are performed indirectly through varying warehouse ship functions, depending on setup. For more information, see [Pick Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md).  

## Ship  
The ship option lets you register the relevant items and time entered on the lines of a service order after you complete the service. A posted shipment is created and updates occur in the Inventory module and other modules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect that the items have been taken out of the inventory and sent to the customer. In particular, the item ledger entries, value ledger entries, service ledger entries, and warranty ledger entries are produced.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then the shipping and moving of service line items functions in the same ways as for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, which requires two different release functions.

## Invoice  
You have to use the invoice option to issue an invoice to the customer you want to charge for the service. Usually, it is the difference between the shipped quantity registered by the **Post Shipment** function and the consumed quantity registered by the **Post Consumption** function that is subject to invoice. You cannot invoice what has not been shipped. When you run the **Post Invoice** function, you create a posted service invoice and update the documents posted before to make them consistent with the quantities that are contained in the issued invoice. Like in other posting procedures, the relevant ledger entries that includes general ledger entries, are generated.  

## Ship and Invoice  
The ship and invoice option lets you issue both a service shipment and an invoice at the same time.  

## Ship and Consume  
With the ship and consume option, you can register and post items, costs, or hours that have been used for servicing but that cannot be included in the invoice to the customer. An invoice is not issued, but you can issue both a service shipment and service consumption at the same time to reflect the fact that some items or hours have been given to the customer free of charge. The corresponding ledger entries are also created to register consumption.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The service posting procedure enables you to perform partial posting. You can create a partial shipment or a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual service lines of the service orders before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice for something that is not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have registered a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.  

After the posting has been completed, you will be able to view the posted service documents from the corresponding **Posted Service Shipment** and **Posted Service Invoice** pages. The posted entries created can be seen in various pages that contain posted entries, such as **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Warehouse Entries**, **Service Ledger Entries**, **Project Ledger Entries**, and **Warranty Ledger Entries**.  

## To view information about a posted service document  
When you post a service invoice, a service shipment, or a service credit memo, the information on the document is transferred to the **Posted Service Invoice**, **Posted Service Shipment**, or **Posted Service Credit Memo** pages respectively. You cannot enter, change, or delete anything in these pages. You can print a shipment, invoice, or credit memo from these pages.  

The following procedure uses a posted service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to posted service shipments and posted credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service invoice you want to view.  
3. To get an overview of the posted invoice, choose the **Statistics** action.  

    The **Service Order Statistics** page opens. The page displays information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit for the posted document.

# Invoicing prepayments

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order, or you can distribute the prepayment across each line on the order. You can also send additional prepayment invoices if, for example, additional items are added to the order. You can increase quantities or add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete a line for which a prepayment has already been invoiced, you must issue a prepayment credit memo before you can delete the line.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Design Details: Transfers in Planning

Transfer orders are also a source of supply when working at the SKU level. When using multiple locations (warehouses), the SKU replenishment system can be set to Transfer, implying that the location is replenished by transferring goods from another location. In a situation with more warehouses, you might have a chain of transfers. Supply to GREEN location is transferred from YELLOW, supply to YELLOW is transferred from RED, and so on. In the beginning of the chain, there's a replenishment system of **Prod. Order** or **Purchase**.  

![Example of transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers1.png "Example of transfer flow")  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

If you compare the following situations, it's clear that the planning task in the latter can become complex:

* A supply order is directly facing a demand order
* A sales order is supplied through a chain of SKU transfers

If demand changes, it might cause a ripple effect through the chain. All transfer orders, plus the purchase and production order in the opposite end of the chain, will have to be updated to re-balance demand and supply.  

![Example of supply/demand balance in transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers2.png "Example of supply/demand balance in transfers")  

## Why is a transfer a special case?  

Transfer orders are similar to other orders, such as purchase and production orders. However, behind the scene they're different.  

One difference is that a transfer line represents both demand and supply. The outbound part that's shipped is demand. The inbound part that's received at the new location is supply at that location.  

![Content of the Transfer Order page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers3.png "Content of the Transfer Order page")  

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the supply side of the transfer, it must make a similar change on the demand side.  

## Transfers are dependent demand  

The demand and supply relationship is similar to components on production order lines. The difference is that components on production order lines are on the next planning level, and have a different item. The two parts of the transfer are on the same level for the same item.  

An important similarity is that components and transfers are dependent demand. Demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer. If the supply changes, the demand is directly affected.

Unless the planning flexibility is None, a transfer line shouldn't be treated as independent demand in planning.  

In the planning procedure, the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the planning system has processed the supply side. Before that processing happens, the actual demand isn't known. The sequence of changes is important for transfer orders.  

## Planning sequence  

The following image shows an example of a string of transfers.  

![Example of simple transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers4.png "Example of simple transfer flow")  

In this example, a customer orders the item at location GREEN. Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED. The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE.  

In this example, the planning system starts at the customer demand and works its way back through the chain. The demands and supplies are processed for one location at a time.  

![Supply planning with transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers5.png "Supply planning with transfers")  

## Transfer level code  

The transfer level code of the SKU determines the sequence in which the planning system processes locations.  

The transfer level code is an internal field. The field is calculated and stored on the SKU when you create or modify the SKU. The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of item and item variant. The calculation uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route to use for the SKUs. The calculation ensures that all demands are processed.  

The transfer level code will be 0 for SKUs with Purchase or Prod. Order replenishment system, and will be -1 for the first transfer level, -2 for the second, and so on. In the example described in the previous section, the levels would be -1 for RED and -2 for GREEN, as shown in the following illustration.  

![Content of SKU Card page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers6.gif "Content of SKU Card page")  

When updating a SKU, the planning system detects whether replenishment systems for SKUs have circular references.  

## Planning transfers without SKU  

For less advanced warehouse setups, you can use locations and make manual transfers between locations, even if you don't use SKUs. For example, the transfer might cover a sales order at that location. The planning system reacts to changes in the demand.  

For manual transfers, the planning system analyzes transfer orders and then plans the order in which to process the locations. Internally, the planning system uses temporary SKUs that have transfer level codes.  

![Transfer level code.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers7.png "Transfer level code")  

If there are several transfers to a location, the first transfer order defines the planning direction. Transfers in the opposite direction are canceled.  

## Changing quantity with reservations  

When changing quantities on a supply, the planning system takes reservations into account. The reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much to reduce the supply.  

When you change the quantity on a transfer order line, keep the lower limit in mind. The lower limit is the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer lines.

For example, a transfer order line of 117 pieces is reserved for the following lines:

* A sales line of 46
* A purchase line of 24

Even though the inbound side might have excess supply, you can't reduce the transfer line below 46.  

![Reservations in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers8.png "Reservations in transfer planning")  

## Changing quantity in a transfer chain  

Here's an example of what happens when you change a quantity in a transfer change.

The starting point is a balanced situation with a transfer chain supplying a sales order of 27 at location RED. There's a corresponding purchase order at location BLUE. Both transfers go through location PINK. There are two transfer orders, BLUE-PINK and PINK-RED.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers9.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1")  

Now, the planner at the PINK location chooses to reserve for the purchase.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers10.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2")  

The reservation usually means that the planning system ignores the purchase order and transfer demand. There isn't a problem long as there's balance. But what happens when the RED location changes the order from 27 to 22?  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers11.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3")  

When the planning system runs again, it should get rid of excess supply. However, the reservation locks the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers12.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4")  

The PINK-RED transfer has been reduced to 22. The inbound part of the BLUE-PINK transfer isn't reserved, but the outbound part is. The reservation means that you can't reduce the quantity below 27.  

## Lead time calculation  

When calculating the due date of a transfer order, different kinds of lead time are taken into account.  

The following lead times are active when planning a transfer order:  

* Outbound warehouse handling time  
* Shipping time  
* Inbound warehouse handling time  

On the planning line, the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation:  

* Transfer shipment date  
* Starting date  
* Ending date  
* Due date  

The shipment date of the transfer line is shown in the **Transfer Shipment Date** field. The receipt date of the transfer line is shown in the **Due Date** field.  

The starting and ending dates describe the actual transportation period.  

The following image shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines for transfer orders.  

![Central date-times in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers13.png "Central date-times in transfer planning")  

The example shows the following calculations:  

* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date  
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date  
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date  

## Safety lead time  

The **Default Safety Lead Time** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page and the related **Safety Lead Time** field on the **Item Card** page aren't included in transfer order calculations. However, the safety lead time does influence the total plan. The safety lead time affects the replenishment order (purchase or production) at the beginning of the transfer chain. That's the point where the items were put in the location from which they'll be transferred.  

![Elements of the transfer due date.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers14.png "Elements of the transfer due date")  

On the production order line, the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date.  

On the purchase order line, the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.  

## Reschedule  

When you reschedule a transfer line, the planning system finds the outbound part and changes the date-time.

> [!NOTE]
> If a lead time is defined, there'll be a gap between the shipment and the receipt. The lead time can consist of more elements, such as transportation time and warehouse handling time. On a time line, the planning system moves back in time while it balances the elements.  

![Changing the due date in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers15.png "Changing the due date in transfer planning")  

When you change the due date on a transfer line, the lead time must be calculated to update the outbound side of the transfer.  

## Serial and lot numbers in transfer chains  

If the demand uses serial or lot numbers, and you run the planning engine, it will create transfer orders. For more information about this concept, see Item Attributes. However, if serial or lot numbers are removed from the demand, the transfer orders still use the serial or lot numbers and planning will ignore them (not deleted).  

## Order-to-order links  

In this example, the BLUE SKU is set up with an **Order** reordering policy. The PINK and RED SKUs have the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy. Creating a sales order for 27 at location RED leads to a chain of transfers. The last transfer is at location BLUE, and it's reserved with binding. In this example, the reservations aren't hard reservations created by the planner at PINK location. The planning system creates the bindings. The important difference is that the planning system can change the latter.  

![Order-to-order links in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers16.png "Order-to-order links in transfer planning")  

If the demand is changed from 27 to 22, the planning system will lower the quantity through the chain. The binding reservation is also reduced.

# Close accounting periods

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it.

## To close accounting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Year** action.

    If more than one fiscal year is open, the earliest one is automatically selected to be closed. A message identifies the year that will close and the results of its closing.
3. To close the year, choose the **Yes** button.

The fiscal year is closed, and the **Closed** and **Date Locked** fields for all the periods in the year are selected. The fiscal year can't be opened again and you can't remove the check mark from the **Closed** or **Date Locked** fields.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't close a fiscal year before you create a new one. Notice that after a fiscal year is closed, you can't change the starting date of the following fiscal year.

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior-Year Entry** field is selected.

After a fiscal year is closed, you must close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. You can repeat this every time that you post to the closed fiscal year.

# Using key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way of measuring whether or not you’re delivering on your objectives.

## Why KPIs matter

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know if your business is on the right path—or if you should change course to avoid losing valuable time and money. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

## Get started identifying your KPIs

So how do you begin to identify the KPIs that are important to your business? Start by clarifying your strategic objectives—collectively or by department.

These goals help you identify which KPIs matter for your company. Picking KPIs that are relevant depends entirely on these objectives and the ability you have to measure your performance against them.

Next, identify the KPI targets that you’re working toward, and how you measure them. Keep in mind that targets can be short and long-term.

Talk to your team and encourage open dialogue about the KPIs and their targets. Are they too aggressive? Too easy? Targets should be challenging but achievable. You should explore the activities and tactics your company uses to achieve them. Take time to understand your current state, so you have a starting point for your KPI.

## Get to know the different types of KPIs

Identifying which KPIs you should track becomes easier when you have a better understanding of the types of KPIs that are most commonly used to measure progress.

- Quantitative KPIs are all about measurable facts that can be represented with a number. Think stats, percentages, and dollar signs.
- Qualitative KPIs involve human interpretations and can’t be quantified with numbers. Think opinions, feelings, and experiences.
- Lagging KPIs measure what happened in the past to predict success or failure. Think of looking back at what you accomplished, or where you struggled.
- Leading KPIs measure performance to predict future success and long-term trends. Think of looking forward to where you’re headed.
- Leading and lagging KPIs are commonly used together. Along with quantitative and qualitative KPIs, they’re a good place to start.

For each KPI that you choose to track, assign an owner and agree on tracking frequency. Whatever KPIs you decide to track, using a KPI platform or tool is key for collaborating with your team on KPI definitions. By collectively defining each KPI, then capturing contextual data and unifying it into a single view, you enable spot-on, real-time actions.

## KPI reporting

KPI reports take the information presented on the KPI dashboard to a new level. They go deeper into the data to pull out more detailed insights and analysis.

A KPI report helps stakeholders and team members identify trends or bottlenecks over a specific time period, so that they’re able to make better decisions. Reporting subjects could include:

- Insights into the company’s day-to-day operations.
- Financial health of the company against targeted KPIs.
- Notable trends or patterns presented by the data.
- Deeper analysis of the data to assist with strategic decision-making.

To create your KPI report, first determine your audience and the objective for the report. For example, you might want to show company stakeholders Q3 progress toward your revenue target. Make sure that all the KPIs featured in your report point back to that central theme.

Other considerations for creating your KPI reports include:

- Explore KPI report templates that might already be included in your KPI tool or platform.
- Set a cadence for reporting frequency.
- Decide whether your report is static or interactive, for more dynamic drill-downs into data.
- Present only the relevant KPIs so you don’t overload the report with KPIs that don’t map back to the reporting - goals.
- Make sure your reporting is clear, easy to understand, and actionable for the intended audience.

## KPI best practices

To help you successfully harness the power of KPIs, here are a few tips to get you started.

Identify KPIs:

- Only pick KPIs that align to your specific goals. It's difficult to match KPIs to unclear objectives.
- Use different KPIs for the same goals if they stretch across departments. For example, the marketing department has different KPIs than the sales team.
- Make sure that for whatever KPIs you pick, there’s a core team responsible for defining them.

Monitoring KPIs:

- Explore the different dashboards, visualization charts, and templates available in your KPI tool or platform. Select the right ones for your goals.
- Make sure to include starting data for comparison, so that your dashboard shows a true representation of company performance and progress over time.
- Determine a cadence for monitoring and acting on KPIs. Are KPI dashboards monitored daily or weekly? Do actions only come after reporting or are stakeholders and/or team members empowered to adjust tactics along the way?
- Be sure you have simple, end-to-end data protection for data dashboards, with controls for sharing outside the organization.

## Common KPI mistakes

Avoid these common KPI mistakes:

- Selecting KPIs that aren’t key to your strategic goals. While it’s smart to track your relevant business metrics, not all of your metrics are worthy of KPI status.
- Adopting poorly defined or vague KPIs. Collaborate with your team to define the KPIs with specific details on how they're measured. Having everyone onboard makes it easier to meet your goals.
- Setting lofty or unrealistic KPI targets. It’s better to set more realistic targets based on historical data, resources, and current tactics. Consider focusing on a specific timeframe or set short- and long-term targets.
- Tracking KPIs without owners. Accountability matters, not just for the results but also for the process. Each KPI should have an owner responsible for monitoring, reporting, analysis, and action.
- Failing to take action on your KPIs. Whether you’re meeting your goals or falling behind, KPIs are tools to help you make better decisions. So don’t track just for tracking’s sake—take action.

# Inspecting pages in Business Central

The page inspection feature enables you to get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection is especially designed for administrators, power users, support personnel, and developers. It's ideal for learning the data model behind a page and troubleshooting. For example, if you're experiencing a problem with a page, you can use page inspection to get information to pass on to your system administrator or support personnel.

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, through page inspection, you can start Visual Studio Code from within the web client to further investigate and debug source code of an extension. For more information, see [Troubleshoot in Visual Studio Code directly from the web client](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-troubleshoot-vscode-webclient) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)]

## Work with page inspection

You start page inspection from the **Help & Support** page. Choose the question mark in the top right corner, choose **Help & Support**, and then choose **Inspect pages and data**. Or, you can just use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>.

The **Page inspection** pane opens on the side. When the pane first opens, it shows information that pertains to the main page object.

Use the keyboard or pointing device to move focus to different elements on the page. When you select a FactBox or a part on the main page, the bounding area is highlighted by a border, and the **Page Inspection** pane shows information about the selected element. For example, the previous figure shows information about the list part in the **Sales Order** page. As you navigate to other pages in the application, the **Page Inspection** pane will automatically update with page information as you move along.

For more information about what is shown in page inspection, see [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

If you don't see the details that you expect to see in the **Page Inspection** pane, you probably don't have the required permissions, as described in the next section.

## Controlling access to page inspection details

As an administrator, you can control access to the full details that are shown in the **Page Inspection** pane by configuring the permissions that users have. To grant a user permission to the full details, give users **Execute** permission on the **System** object **5330**. You can grant this permission by using a permission set (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**) or a user group (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**). For more information about permissions, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

Users who aren't granted permissions on **System object 5330** can still access the **Page Inspection** pane, but they will only see the **Page** and **Table** fields, which display basic details that they can pass on to their support team.

description: Assign types and basic flow activities to bins and, in doing so, define the way the bins are used for particular warehouse activities.

# Set Up Bin Types

You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities. You give each bin its basic flow activities, and thereby define the way a bin is used, by assigning it a bin type.  

There are six types. You can operate your warehouse with all of the six possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.  

## To set up the bin types you want to use

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Bin Types** page, create a 10-character code for a bin type.  
3.  Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location.  

The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document, and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement.  

The bin types that you can create are listed below.  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used only for picking, for example, for items with an approaching expiration date that you have moved into this type of bin. You would place a high bin ranking on these bins so they are suggested for picking first.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|

# Managing Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides an overview of what you can do as an administrator to control Microsoft Teams integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## In Microsoft Teams

### Minimum requirements

This section describes the minimum requirements for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app features to work in Teams.

- Required licenses

    The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app requires a Teams license through a Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise plan, Microsoft Teams EEA, or a similar plan that includes Microsoft Teams. Standalone Teams plans like Microsoft Teams (free) or Microsoft Teams Essentials aren't supported.

    Most features of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams also require a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license, as shown in the following table.

    |What|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license|
    |----|---|
    |Search for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record into a conversation, and send it as a card.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Share a link from a page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Teams conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |View a card of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.||
    |View more details of card for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record in a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
    |Open a page link in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from a conversation.|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|

- Allow URL previews

    **Allow URL previews** policy setting must be turned on. Otherwise, a card can't be generated for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links pasted into a Teams conversation. Learn more about this setting in [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

### Managing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app (optional)

As a Teams administrator, you can manage all apps for your organization, including the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. You can approve or install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for your organization, block user's from installing the app, and more.

Learn more in the Microsoft Teams documentation at:

- [Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps)
- [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies)

## In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

### Minimum requirements

- [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version:

  Teams integration is only supported for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, not on-premises.

- Codeunit **2718 Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service:

  This codeunit is published as a web service by default. The codeunit is part of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] system application. It's used to get the field data for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page added to a Teams conversation. Learn more about publishing web services in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

- <a name="permissions"></a>User permissions:

  For the most part, the contact search, pages, and data that users can view and edit in a Teams conversation is controlled by their permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

  - To search for contacts, users must have at least read permission to the **Contacts** table. 
  - To paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link into a Teams conversation and have it expand into a card, users must have at least read permission on the page and its data.
  - Once a card is submitted into a conversation, any user in that conversation can view that card without permission to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  - To view more details for a card or open the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must have read permission on the page and its data.
  - To change data, user's need modify permissions.

  Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment

The Microsoft Teams admin center is where you configure Teams app setup policies for the organization. In the Teams admin center, you can use the Centralized Deployment feature to automatically install the Business Central app in Teams for all users in your organization, specific groups, or individual users.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up Centralized Deployment, your Teams account must have at least the [Teams Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#teams-administrator) role.

1. In Business Central, choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Teams App Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link. Or select [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1833) to open the page directly.
2. Read the information on the **Set up the Business Central app for Teams**, then choose **Next** when ready.
3. Open the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163970), and complete the following steps.
    1. Go to **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.
    2. Create a new policy or select the policy that you want to use to install the Business Central app, then select **Add apps**.
    3. In the **Add installed apps** page, search for and select **Business Central**.
    4. Choose **Add**.

       Business Central should now appear under **Installed apps** for the policy.
    5. Configure more settings as needed, then choose **Save**.

    Learn more in [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies) in the Teams documentation.
4. Go back to **Teams App Centralized Deployment** in Business Central and select **Done**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the app setup policy to be applied and the app deployed to users.

## Managing privacy and compliance

Microsoft Teams provides extensive controls for compliance and management of sensitive or personally identifiable data&mdash;including data added to chats and channels by the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

### Understanding where [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] cards are stored

After a card is sent to a chat, the card and the fields shown on the card are copied to Teams. This information is subject to the Teams policies for your organization, such as data retention policies. When displaying card details, none of the data in the details window is stored in Teams. The data remains stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and will only be retrieved by Teams when the user chooses to view the details. 

- Learn more about where Teams stores that data at [Location of data in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams).
- Learn more about retention policies in Teams at [Retention policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/retention-policies).

### Restricting sharing of cards 

You prevent specific users or groups from sending cards to chats or channels by setting up messaging policies that turn off the **URL Previews** setting. For more information about this setting, see [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams). 

You can also use information barriers to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other. To learn more, see [Information barriers in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/information-barriers-in-teams).

Data loss prevention features in the Microsoft Purview can't be applied specifically to cards. But they can be applied to the chat messages that contain the cards.

### Responding to data requests

You allow team members and team owners to delete messages that contain sensitive cards by setting up messaging policies, like: **Owners can delete sent messages** and **Users can delete sent messages**. Learn more at [Manage messaging policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams).

Content search and eDiscovery compliance features in the Microsoft Purview can also be applied to cards.

Because card data in Teams is a copy of data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can also use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features to export a customer’s data if requested. Learn more  about privacy in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Privacy FAQ for Business Central Customers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/privacyfaq).

## Show or hide record data on cards

When a record is shared with others in a Teams chat or channel, a card with fields that contain data about the record is shown. All recipients can view this data (or record summary) by default, regardless of their license or permissions in Business Central. If you're an admin, you can use the **Card Settings** assisted setup guide to hide the record summary from appearing on cards in Teams. Hiding the record summary removes all fields and images but continues to show the **Details** button and other non-record information on the card.

|Record summary on|Record summary off|
|-|-|
|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned on.](media/card-settings-example-on.png)|![Image that shows a card in Teams when the record summery is turned off.](media/card-settings-example-off.png)|

You configure the setting per environment. So when you turn the record summary on or off, it affects all companies in the environment.

1. In Business Central, open the environment that you want to change.

   > [!TIP]
   > To switch the environment, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.
2. Choose the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Card Settings**, and then choose the related link.
3. Read the information on the **Card Settings**, then choose **Next** when ready.
4. On the **Data Visibility** page, turn on the **Show record summary** switch to display data on the cards or off to hide the data.
5. Select **Next** and follow the instructions to complete the setup guide.

# About unit cost calculation

Each item has a unit cost that is calculated based on the company's costing method and other factors. As a rule, with the *Standard* costing method, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. For all other costing methods (*FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, and *Average*), the unit cost is calculated based on the average unit cost across a period of time.  

## When is the unit cost field updated for item

The chosen costing method influences when the **Unit Cost** field is updated.

When the costing method is set as *Standard*, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed, and users can't edit the **Unit Cost** field. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

If the costing method is *FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, or *Average*, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

In the **Unit Cost** field on the item card, you can drill down to view the history of transactions that the average cost of units on hand is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.

## Impact of unit cost field on purchases and sales
How the contents of the **Costing Method** field influence the unit cost calculation for purchases and sales is described in more detail in the following sections.

### Unit cost calculation for purchases

When you purchase items, the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card is copied to the **Direct Unit Cost** field on a purchase line or to the **Unit Amount** line on an item journal line.

What you select in the **Costing Method** field influences how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the lines.

#### Costing method FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the item journal line according to the following formula:

*Unit Cost (LCY) = (Direct Unit Cost – (Discount Amount / Quantity)) x (1 + Indirect Cost % / 100) + Overhead Rate*

#### Costing method Standard

The **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the **Unit Cost** field is filled on the item journal line by copying the value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card. By using costing method set as *Standard*, this value is always based on the standard cost.

When you post the purchase, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line to the purchase item invoice entry. You can see it on the entry list for the item.

#### All costing methods

The unit cost from the source document line is used to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field that relates to this item entry, regardless of the costing method of the item.

### Unit cost calculation for sales

When you sell items, the unit cost is copied from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line.

When you post, the unit cost is copied to the sales invoice item entry, and it can be seen on the entry list for the item. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the source document line to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field in the value entry related to this item entry.

<!--
## To make general changes in the last direct unit cost

If you need to change the direct unit cost for several items, you can use the **Adjust Item Costs/Prices** batch job.  

The batch job changes the contents in the **Unit Price** field on the item card. The batch job changes the content of the field in the same way for all items or selected items. The batch job multiplies the value in the field by an adjustment factor that you specify.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Item Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Adjust Field** field, specify which item or SKU card field you want to adjust.  
3. In the **Adjustment Factor** field, specify the factor by which to adjust the value. For example, enter **1.5** to increase the value by 50%.

# Set up data exchange definitions

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to exchange data in specific tables with data on external files. For example to send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll, and item catalogs. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

To create a data exchange definition for a data file or stream, you can use the related XML schema to define which data elements to include on the **Column Definitions** FastTab. See step 6 in [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#to-describe-the-formatting-of-lines-and-columns-in-the-file). Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Normally, you set up data exchange definitions on the **Data Exchange Definition** page. However, for updating currency exchange rates, it's faster to use a currency exchange rate service. Learn more at [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the file that is being converted is in the XML format, the term *"column"* in this article should be interpreted as an *"XML element containing data"*.  

This article includes the following procedures:  

* Create a data exchange definition.
* Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others.
* Import an XML file for an existing data exchange definition.

## Create a data exchange definition

Creating a data exchange definition involves two tasks:  

1. On the **Data Exchange Definition** page, describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file. Learn more in the [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](#formatlinescolumns) section.  
2. On the **Data Exchange Mapping** page, map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](#mapfields) section.  

### <a name=formatlinescolumns></a>To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, describe the data exchange definition and the data file type by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Definition|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the data exchange definition.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the data exchange definition.|  
    |**File Type**|Specify what type of file the data exchange definition is used for. You can select between four file types:<br /><br /> -   **XML**: Layered strings of content and markup surrounded by tags indicating function.<br />-   **Variable Text**: Records have variable length and are separated by a character, such as a comma or semi\-colon, also known as *delimited file*.<br />-   **Fixed Text**: Records have the same length, using pad characters, and each record is on a separate line, also known as *fixed-width file*.<br />- **Json**: Layered strings of content in JavaScript.|  
    |**Type**|Specify what type of business activity the data exchange definition is used for, such as **Payment Export**.|  
    |**Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers data in and out of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Validation Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to validate data against predefined business rules.|  
    |**Reading/Writing Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that processes imported data before mapping and the exported data afterward.|  
    |**Reading/Writing XMLport**|Specify the XMLport through which an imported data file or service enters before mapping, and through which exported data is written to a data file or service afterward.|  
    |**Ext. Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers external data in and out of the data exchange framework.|  
    |**User Feedback Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that does various clean-up after mapping, such as marks the lines as exported and deletes temporary records.|  
    |**File Encoding**|Specify the encoding of the file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Column Separator**|Specify how columns in the data file are separated, if the file is of type **Variable Text**.|  
    |**Header Lines**|Specify how many header lines exist in the file.<br /><br /> This setting makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Header Tag**|If a header line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the header line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Footer Tag**|If a footer line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the footer line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the footer data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  

   > [!TIP]
   > To see which codeunits Microsoft uses in existing definitions in the standard product, review the three **Codeunit** fields on the **Field Mapping** page, under the **General** FastTab, for each definition.  

4. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, describe the formatting of lines in the data file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For import of bank statements, you only create one line for the single format of the bank statement file that you want to import.  
    >
    > For export of payments, you can create a line for each payment type that you want to export. In that case, the **Column Definitions** FastTab shows different columns for each payment type.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Line Type**|Specifies the type of the line in the file.|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the line in the file.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name that describes the line in the file.|  
    |**Column Count**|Specify how many columns the line in the data file has. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Data Line Tag**|Specify the position in the related XML schema of the element that represents the main entry of the data file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Namespace**|Specify the namespace that's expected in the file to enable namespace validation. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to enable namespace validation.|  
    |**Parent Code**|Specify the line's parent, as displayed in the **Code** field in cases where the data exchange setup is for files with parent and children entries, such as a document header and lines.

5. Repeat step 4 to create a line for every type of file data that you want to export.  

     Proceed to describe the formatting of columns in the data file by filling the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab as described in the table in step 8. You can use a structure file, such as an .xsd file, for the data file to prefill the FastTab with the relevant elements. Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).

6. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, choose the **Get File Structure** action.  
7. On the **Get File Structure** page, select the related structure file, then choose **OK**. The lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab are filled according to the structure of the data file.  
8. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, edit or fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Column No.**|Specify the number that reflects the column's position on the line in the file.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the number that reflects the type of element in the file that contains the data.|  
    |**Name**|Specify the name of the column.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the markup that marks the data to be exchanged.|  
    |**Data Type**|Specify if the data to be exchanged is of type **Text**, **Date**, or **Decimal**.|  
    |**Data Format**|Specify the format of the data, if any. For example, **MM-dd-yyyy** if the data type is **Date**. **Note:** For export, specify the data format according to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For import, specify the data format according to the .NET Framework. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).|  
    |**Data Formatting Culture**|Specify the regional data format, if any. For example, **en-US** if the data type is **Decimal** to make sure that comma is used as the 0.000 separator, according to the US format. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings). **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Length**|Specify the length of the fixed-width line that holds the column if the data file is of type **Fixed Text**.|  
    |**Description**|Specifies a description of the column, for informational purposes.|  
    |**Path**|Specify the position of the element in the related XML schema.|  
    |**Negative-Sign Identifier**|Enter the value that is used in the data file to identify negative amounts, in data files that can't contain negative signs. This identifier is then used to reverse the identified amounts to negative signs during import. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Constant**|Specify any data that you want to export in this column, such as extra information about the payment type. **Note:** This field is only relevant for export.|  
    |**Text Padding Required**|Specify that the data must include text padding.|  
    |**Pad Character**|Specify the text padding character.|  
    |**Justification**|Specify if the column justification is left or right.|  

9. Repeat step 8 for every column or XML element in the data file that has data that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The next step in creating a data exchange definition is to decide which columns or XML elements in the data file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> The specific mapping depends on the business purpose of the data file to be exchanged and on local variations. Even the SEPA bank standard has local variations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import of SEPA CAMT bank statement files out\-of\-the\-box. This is represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition record code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page. For information about the specific field mapping of this SEPA CAMT support, see [Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files](across-field-mapping-when-importing-sepa-camt-files.md).  

### <a name=mapfields></a>To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in one business app the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in another it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you exchange data. This happens through transformation rules that you define for the fields. Learn more at [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

You can also group by any field, use the key index to sort results, and the new transformation types **Rounding** and **Field Lookup**.

1. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select the line for which you want to map columns to fields, then choose **Field Mapping**. The **Data Exchange Mapping** page opens.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, specify the mapping setup by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table ID**|Specify the table that holds the fields to or from which data is exchanged according to the mapping.|  
    |**Use as Intermediate Table**|Specify if the table that you select in the **Table ID** field is an intermediate table where the imported data is stored before it's mapped to the target table.<br/><br/> You typically use an intermediate table when the data exchange definition imports and converts electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, documents such as vendor invoices into purchase invoices. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the mapping setup.|  
    |**Key Index**|Specify the key index to sort the source records before exporting.|
    |**Pre-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that prepares the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data.|  
    |**Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to map the specified columns or XML data elements to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Post-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that completes the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data. **Note:**  When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension feature, the codeunit converts exported data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a generic format that's ready for export. For import, the codeunit converts external data to a format that is ready for import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
3. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, specify which columns map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by filling the fields as described in the following tables, depending on whether the **Use as Intermediate Table** field was enabled or not.  
   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle off:

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field ID**|Specify which field the column in the **Column No.** field maps to.<br /><br /> You can only select from fields that exist in the table that you specified in the **Table ID** field on the **General** FastTab.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Optional**|Specify if the map should be skipped if the field is empty. If you don't select this option, then an export error occurs if the field is empty.|  
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about how to apply transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Overwrite Value**|Specify that the new value can overwrite the current value.|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|
     |**Multiplier**|Specify a multiplier to be applied on numeric data, including negative values.|

   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle enabled:

     |Field|Description|  
     |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Table ID**|Specify the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Table Caption**|Specify the name of the table in the **Target Table ID** field, which is the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Field ID**|Specify the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the name of the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Validate Only**|Specify that the element-to-field map isn't used to convert data, but only to validate data.|
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|

4. On the **Field Grouping** FastTab, specify rules you want to use to group your fields when you create the file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Field ID**|Specify the number of the field in the external file that is used for grouping, and that the user must set this field.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is used for grouping.|

## Transformation Rules

If the values in the fields you're mapping differ, you must use transformation rules for data exchange definitions to make them the same. You define transformation rules for data exchange definitions by opening an existing definition, or creating a new definition, and then on the **Line Definitions** FastTab, choosing **Manage**, and then **Field Mapping**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. The following table describes the types of transformations that you can perform.

|Option|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Uppercase**|Capitalize all letters.|
|**Lowercase**|Make all letters lowercase.|
|**Title Case**|Capitalize the first letter of each word.|
|**Trim**|Remove empty spaces before and after the value.|
|**Substring**|Transform a specific portion of a value. To specify where to start the transformation, choose either a **Start Position** or **Starting Text**. The starting position is a number that represents the first character to transform. The starting text is the letter immediately before the letter to replace. If you want to start with the first letter in the value, use a starting position instead. To specify where to stop the transformation, you choose either **Length**, which is the number of characters to replace, or the **Ending Text**, which is the character that is immediately after the last character to transform.|
|**Replace**|Find a value and replace it with another. This transformation is useful for replacing simple values, such as a particular word.|
|**Regular Expression - Replace**|Use a regular expression as part of a find and replace operation. This transformation is useful for replacing multiple, or more complex, values.|
|**Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters**|Delete characters that aren't letters or numbers, such as symbols or special characters.|
|**Date Formatting**|Specify how to display dates. For example, you can transform DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.|
|**Decimal Formatting**|Define rules for decimal placement and rounding precision.|
|**Regular Expression - Match**|Use a regular expression to find one or more values. This rule is similar to the **Substring** and **Regular Expression - Replace** options.|
|**Custom**|This transformation rule is an advanced option that requires assistance from a developer. It enables an integration event that you can subscribe to if you want to use your own transformation code. If you're a developer and want to use this option, go to [Tip for developers: Example of the custom option](#tip-for-developers-example-of-the-custom-option).|
|**Date and Time Formatting**|Define how to display the current date and the time of day.|
|**Field Lookup**|Use fields from different tables. To use it, you need to follow some rules. First, use **Table ID** to specify the ID of the table that contains the record for the field lookup. Then, in the **Source Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field that contains the record for the field lookup. Finally, in the **Target Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field to find the record for the field lookup. Optionally, use the **Field Lookup Rule** field to specify the type of the field lookup. For the **Target** field, the value from the **Target Field ID** is used, even if it's blank. For the **Original If Target Is Blank** field, the original value is used if the target is blank.|
|**Round**|Round the value in this field using some extra rules. First, in the **Precision** field, specify a rounding precision. Then, in the **Direction** field, specify the rounding direction.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Learn more about date and time formatting at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).

### Tip for developers: Example of the custom option

The following example shows how to implement your own transformation code.

```AL
codeunit 60100 "Hello World"
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::"Transformation Rule", 'OnTransformation', '', false, false)]
    procedure OnTransformation(TransformationCode: Code[20]; InputText: Text; var OutputText: Text)
    begin
        if TransformationCode = 'CUST' then
            OutputText := InputText + ' testing';
    end;
}
```

After you define your rules, you can test them. In the **Test** FastTab, enter an example of a value that you want to transform, then check the results by choosing **Update**.

## Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others

After you create the data exchange definition for a specific data file, you can export the data exchange definition as an XML file that you can import. This task is described in the following procedure.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the data exchange definition that you want to export.  
3. Choose the **Export Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  

    If a data exchange definition was already created, you just have to import the XML file into the Data Exchange Framework. This task is described in the following procedure.  

## Import an existing data exchange definition

1. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
3. Choose the **Import Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Choose the file that you saved in step 1.

# The Company Hub for Business Central Extension

This application provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that the user has access to across all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, such as the many clients of an accountant. The home page displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the individual environments and companies so that users can.

The dashboard is a highly specialized Role Center for a better overview of your work.

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.

## Installing the extension

When you install the extension in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you will be asked if you want to use it now. If you do, then you must sign out and sign in again, because the extension replaces your current Role Center and adds permissions to your user profile.

# Design details: costing methods

The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Together with the posting date and sequence, the costing method also influences how the cost flow is recorded.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change an item's costing method if item ledger entries exist for the item. For more information, see [Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

The following methods are supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

| Costing method | Description | When to use |
|--|--|--|
| FIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. | In business environments where product cost is stable.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.)<br /><br /> For items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date. |
| LIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. | Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates.) |
| Average | An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that all inventories are sold simultaneously. | In business environments where product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> When inventories are piled or mixed together and can't be differentiated, such as chemicals. |
| Specific | An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. | In production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> For items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> For items with serial numbers. |
| Standard | An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values. | Where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> In repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Where there's discipline and staff to maintain standards. |

The following image shows how costs flow through the inventory for each costing method.  

![Costing methods visualized.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_7_costing_methods.png "Costing methods visualized")  

Costing methods differ in the way that they value inventory decreases and if they use actual cost or standard cost as the valuation base. The following table explains the different characteristics. (The LIFO method is excluded, as it's similar to the FIFO method.)

## Example

This section gives examples of how different costing methods affect inventory value.  

The following table shows the inventory increases and decreases that the examples are based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|1|1|  
|01-01-20|1|2|  
|01-01-20|1|3|  
|02-01-20|-1|4|  
|03-01-20|-1|5|  
|04-01-20|-1|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting quantity in inventory is zero. Consequently, the inventory value must also be zero, regardless of the costing method.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Increases  

For items with costing methods that use actual cost as the valuation base (**FIFO**, **LIFO**, **Average**, or **Specific**), inventory increases are valued at the item's acquisition cost.  

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

#### Standard  

For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Decreases

- **FIFO**  

    For items using the **FIFO** costing method, items that were purchased first are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the first inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the first inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **FIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|6|  

- **LIFO**  

    For items using the **LIFO** costing method, items that were purchased most recently are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the last inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the most recent inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **LIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------|--------|--------------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-30.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|  

- **Average**  

    For items using the **Average** costing method, inventory decreases are valued by calculating a weighted average of the remaining inventory on the last day of the average cost period in which the inventory decrease was posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md).  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Average** costing method.  

    | Posting Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | 02-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 4 |
    | 03-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 5 |
    | 04-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 6 |

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory decreases are valued similar to the **FIFO** costing method, except valuation is based on a standard cost, not on the actual cost.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Standard** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-15.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-15.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-15.00|6|  

- **Specific**  

    Costing methods make an assumption about how cost flows from an inventory increase to an inventory decrease. However, if more accurate information about the cost flow exists, then you can override this assumption by creating a fixed application between entries. A fixed application creates a link between an inventory decrease and a specific inventory increase and directs the cost flow accordingly.  

    For items that use the **Specific** costing method, inventory decreases are valued according to the inventory increase that the fixed application links it to.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Specific** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Applies-to Entry|Entry No.|
    |------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-20.00|**2**|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-10.00|**1**|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|**3**|6|

# Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages

Before you start using sales opportunities, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. A sales cycle is made up of a series of stages that go from the initial contact to the closing of a sale. For each stage, you define any requirements that must be met, such as requiring a sales quote, before an opportunity can go to the next stage. You can also specify whether a stage can be skipped. You can set up as many sales cycles as you need. You can set up as many sales cycle stages as necessary within a sales cycle.

To use opportunity sales cycles, you must set up the sales cycle, define the different stages of the cycle, and then assign the cycle to opportunities. Assigning the relevant activity or tasks to the opportunity may also be part of setting up a sales cycle.

This article also describes how to set up tasks and activities, and how to assign tasks to activities. For more information, see [To set up activities with tasks](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md#to-set-up-activities-with-tasks).

## To set up opportunity sales cycle codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Cycles**, and then choose the related link. The **Sales Cycles** page opens, and lists all the existing sales cycles.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Repeat these steps to set up as many sales cycles as you want. After you have set up opportunity sales cycles, you may want to set up the different stages within each cycle.

## To define opportunity sales cycle stages

1. On the **Sales Cycles** page, select the opportunity sales cycle for which you want to set up stages, and then choose the **Stages** action. The **Sales Cycle Stages** page opens.
2. Choose the **New** action to enter a new stage in the sales cycle.

Repeat these steps to set up as many stages as you want within the sales cycle.

## To assign stage cycles to opportunities

After you add the opportunities stage cycle, you can start to add sales opportunities, and then assign the stage cycle to opportunities by setting the **Sales Cycle Code** field. For more information, see [Create Sales Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md).

## To set up activities with tasks

You can combine multiple tasks, such as tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. You can assign activities to opportunities, salespeople, or contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Activities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define one or more tasks in the activity.

## To assign tasks or activities of tasks to opportunities

When you have set up a task, you can assign it to a sales opportunity and thereby assign the activity that the task belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create tasks of type *Meeting* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. The capability requires access to an on-premises deployment.

The following procedure describes how to assign activity tasks to opportunities. The steps are similar when you assign tasks to salespeople and contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an opportunity, and then choose the **Tasks** action.
3. On the **Task List** page, choose the **Create Task** action.
4. The **Create Task** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > As you can see in the **Opportunity** field, the task is automatically assigned to the relevant opportunity.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. On the **Task List** page, select the new task, and then choose the **Assign Activities** action.
7. On the **Assign Activity** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Create recurring sales

If you often need to create sales lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring sales documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.  

## Set up recurring sales lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Sales Lines**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter information in the fields to prepare sales lines that reflect the standard lines that you expect to use as recurring lines on sales documents.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring sales lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual sales documents after you insert the recurring sales lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring sales lines to a customer

Assign one or more recurring sales lines to a customer so that they are available to insert on sales documents for that customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant customer.
3. Select **Related** and **Sales**
4. Choose the **Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, select codes for the recurring sales lines that you want to be able to insert on sales documents for the customer.
6. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring sales lines are to be used.  

    If you plan to use the recurring sales lines set together with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job, use the **Valid From Date** and **Valid To Date** fields to restrict when the recurring sales lines are used for creation of invoices. For more information, see [Create multiple sales invoices based on standard sales lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md#create-multiple-sales-invoices-based-on-recurring-sales-lines).

    You can also specify a direct-debit payment method and a direct-debit mandate. The sales invoices that are created with the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job will then include the information required to collect payment with SEPA direct debit. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

7. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on four document types, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring sales line that exists for the customer.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring sales line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Sales Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a customer card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring sales lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring sales lines on a sales invoice

If recurring sales lines exist for the customer, you can insert them, or have them inserted, on all types of sales documents, such as a sales invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring sales lines to customers, you'll be informed if recurring sales lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to insert one or more standard sales lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Sales Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard sales lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard sales lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

## Create multiple sales invoices based on recurring sales lines

You can use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to standard sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the standard sales lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Recurring Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **Code** filter field, enter the code for standard sales lines that are assigned to a customer that you want to create sales invoices for.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

Sales invoices are created for the customers with the specified standard customer sales code, and any specified direct-debit information, for posting on the specified date.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sales data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My customers" or "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sales processes:

- [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis)
- General Ledger Entries
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- Item Ledger Entries
- Posted Sales Invoices
- Sales Return Orders

## Sales ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sales scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Sales (expected sales volume)](#example-sales-expected-sales-volume) | Analyze your expected sales volume. | [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) | **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, **No.** , **Amount**, **Document Date Year**, and **Document Date Month**. |
| [Sales (Customer sales by volume)](#example-sales-customer-sales-by-volume) | Get an overview of the customers that purchase the most, or that owe the most. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Document No.**, **Amount**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Receivables)](#example-finance-accounts-receivables) | See what your customers owe you, for example, broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Due Date**, and **Remaining Amount**. |

## Example: Sales (expected sales volume)

To analyze your expected sales volume and sales amounts for unshipped orders for each customer by year or month, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Document Date Year** and **Document Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Expected sales volume** or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Example: Sales (Customer sales by volume)

To produce an overview of the customers that purchase the most or that owe the most, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list, and switch on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and the **Document No.** field below it.
1. Choose the **Amount** and **Remaining Amount** fields.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Customer by sales volume**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

## Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sales

After you enter information on a sales order and add all the sales order lines, you can post the order. Posting creates a shipment and an invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries:

- For each sales order, a sales entry is created on the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount.
- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

# Add Business Central tab in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In Teams, tabs appear at the top of channels and chats, giving participants quick access to pertinent information. This article explains different ways to add a tab that displays [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

## About Business Central tabs

A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab provides a focused view of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list and card pages. The tab doesn't display the full [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client. There's no browser border, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] banner (for example with Tell Me, search, help) or top navigation menu&mdash;just page content and its actions. The content is interactive, meaning that you can select actions and links, change data, and more. You're limited to what you see and can do by the same permissions assigned to your account in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Learn more about who can view the content of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab in [Who can see the content of a tab?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#who-can-view).

> [!TIP]
> Are you a developer? You can also add tabs programmatically using the Microsoft Graph API. Learn more in [Add Business Central Tabs to Teams](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-for-teams-tabs).  

## Prerequisites

To add a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

To view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab that was added by another participant in the channel or chat, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license or limited access to Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license only. Learn more in [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

## Add tab using recommended content

Use these steps to add a tab by choosing what to display from a readily available list of recommended content that's based your role center&mdash;without leaving Teams. Learn more about the content that you can choose from in [Where does the recommended content come from?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#where-does-the-recommended-content-come-from).

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon and wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window.png)

3. The **Choose from content recommended for** option shows the company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you working with. If you want to show content from another company, select the current company, then use the **Environment** and **Company** options to specify company you want to work with.
4. Select down arrow in the **Tab content** option and choose the content that you want to display.

   <!-- The list shows all pages that are bookmarked on your role center in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the content that you can choose from, see [Where does the recommended content come from?](teams-faq.md#recommended-content).-->
5. Some pages may include different views, which are variations of the page that's filtered to show specific data. To change the view for the content, select the down arrow for the **Preferred view** option and choose the view from the list.

   Learn more in [Save and Personalize Views](ui-views.md).
6. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
7. Select **Save**.

## Add tab using a page link

Another way to add a tab by using a link (URL) to the page that you want to show. This way is useful when you want to display a specific [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record or a list page that isn't bookmarked on your role center.

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon.
3. Wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear, then select **Paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link instead** option.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and highlights the link option](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-page-link.png)
4. Go to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and open the page that you want to display in the tab.
5. Copy the link to the page.

   There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. The other way is to copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar. Learn more in [Sharing Business Central Records and Page Links](across-working-with-teams.md).

6. Go back to Teams and paste the link in the **URL** box.
7. In the **Tab name** box, enter a name that displays on the tab.
8. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
9. Select **Save**.

## Change a tab and its content

After a tab has been added, you can make certain changes to the tab. For example, you can rename the tab, move it, and remove it. You find these actions in the tab options that are available by selecting the down arrow on the tab.

![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and the tab options menu](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-options-2.png)

As for the content of a tab, you can modify the data, if you have permission. If you change the data, others won't see the changes until they leave the tab and come back. The same is true for you if someone else makes changes to data. You can't change the page that displays on the tab, so just remove the tab and add another one the suits.

You can also change your view of the page and its data, like sorting and switching the layout between list and tile views. When you make these kinds of changes, they won't affect what others see. They see what you originally posted, until they make similar changes themselves.

# Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides information on how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using Microsoft Teams with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], as a typical user or administrator.

## The sign-in link doesn't work

If you try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams immediately after installing the app, and the sign-in link doesn't react, the app might not be fully installed. To try to fix the issue, sign out of your Teams client and then sign in again.

## The Settings page is empty

You must first sign in to reach your settings. To sign into the app, either paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] record, or try to search for contacts. Both of these actions will lead you through a sign-up experience, after which you can use the **Settings** page.

## I changed company but it didn't seem to work

After you change the company on the **Settings** page, you might notice that the command box drop-down indicates you're still searching the previous company. This issue happens when you open the **Settings** page directly from the command box. In this case, the company was successfully changed, and you'll in fact search the company you switched to. The problem is that the command box drop-down hasn't updated yet. Close or unpin [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] from the command box, and then open the app again to ensure that the drop-down accurately reflects the company you're searching for. 

## "Something went wrong" error when searching for contacts

You might experience this error when you search in a company that isn't initialized or is in an unresponsive state. For example, you can't search in a new trial company that hasn't yet accepted the terms of use. To resolve this issue, try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client, and act on or dismiss any initial dialogs that appear.

## "Cannot find the contact/contact summary API" error when searching for contacts

This problem can be caused by customizations or industry solutions that affect or modify [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], or they don't provide a contact or contact summary API. If the problem continues, contact your administrator or supporting partner.

## None of my links expand into a card 

If you're experiencing this problem, here are a few things to try:

1. First, make sure that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed.

    To check, sign in to the Teams desktop app or Teams in the browser. Then, on the left side, select **Apps**, and search for **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. When you find the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app, select it to open the app details page. If the **Add** button is shown, then the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app isn't installed. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Guest users can't immediately install apps. Learn more in [FAQ about collaborating with guests](teams-faq.md?tabs=collaborating#language). 

2. Next, check that you've signed in with the correct identity.

    In Teams, go to any chat, and under the message compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] icon, then choose **Settings**. The window that appears states the user account that you’re signed in as. Verify that it’s the correct user account.

3. Make sure codeunit 2718 **Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service.

    Teams connects to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an endpoint to this codeunit on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. Learn more in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

4. Your organization can also restrict you from pasting links that expand into cards. Contact your administrator to understand the Teams organizational policies that apply to you.

## My link sometimes doesn’t expand into a card 

A link won't expand into a card in the following situations:

- The link targets a page that (at a technical level) isn't connected to a source table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check whether a page has a source table by using the page inspection pane in the Web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about page inspection Learn more in [Inspecting Pages](across-inspect-page.md).
- Teams doesn't support link previews in some of its features. For example, when you pop out a chat, or you're a guest to another organization.
- Network issues cause Teams to silently abandon trying to display the card after 15 seconds, for example.
- Teams might not expand the link if you've already pasted a link into the same message compose box and deleted the card.
- When using Teams in some browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, the link isn't automatically detected as soon as you paste it into the compose box. You might need to add a space after the link or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for Teams to recognize the link and expand it into a card.

The link must also contain all the necessary information to locate the record and display the corresponding card. This information includes:

- The environment name, by including it in the URL path. If you don't specify the environment name, Teams assumes you're attempting to reach the environment named "Production".
- The company name, by using the *company=* parameter
- The page identifier, by using the *page=* parameter
- The bookmark to the record, by using the *bookmark=* parameter

For example:

`https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?environmentname=Production&company=CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.&page=21&dc=0&bookmark=21%3bEgAAAAJ7BTEAMAAwADAAMA%3d%3d`

Learn more about [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] URLs in [Web Client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls) in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and IT Pro Help.

## The details window opens, but shows an error before details are shown

This problem can be caused by a couple of things: lack of permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or browser settings (when using Teams in the browser).

1. Verify your permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    To view details for a card, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your license and permissions to view that specific record and page in the specific company and environment. If you aren't authorized for any of these things, standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] error messages about permissions appear in the details window. 

    Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

2. Check your browser settings if using Teams in the browser.

    - Your browser's pop-up blocker must be either turned off or set to allow pop-ups from the *businesscentral.dynamics.com* or *bc.dynamics.com* domains. Learn more in about allowing pop-ups for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Setting Up Your Browser](across-browser-settings.md#popup).
    - Your browser must have access to local browser storage for cookies and preferences as you work.
    - Avoid using guest or private browsing unless necessary, because they discard or block certain content in some browsers.

   Learn more about minimum browser requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](product-requirements.md#browsers).

## I'm having problems with the camera or location in Teams

When using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that require access to your location or device camera, you must first give your consent for Teams to access these device capabilities.  

- For Teams in the browser, make sure that your browser settings allow access to camera and location for [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com).

- For Teams for iOS or Android, make sure that your device settings allow access to camera and location for the Teams mobile app. 

Learn more about changing these settings at [My camera isn't working in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/my-camera-isn-t-working-in-teams-9581983b-c6f9-40e3-b0d8-122857972ade?ns=msftteams&version=16&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) on Microsoft Support.

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't support location in the Teams desktop app. Learn more in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#location).

Some browsers, such as the new Microsoft Edge, allow you to choose which device camera to use when your device supports multiple cameras. 

## Teams displays mixed languages for my cards and card details

For cards and card details to display consistently in the same language in Teams, the language of your Teams client and the language you use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client must match.

- Learn more about changing the language in Teams in [Change settings in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7) on Microsoft Support. 

- Learn more about changing the language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [Change Basic Settings - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

Learn more about how languages work between Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#language).

## I edited a field in the details window, but my change wasn't saved

Changes you make to a field in the details windows are automatically saved when you leave the field. Before you close the window after changing a field, be sure to select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or click/tap outside the field.

## A new tile appeared in the App Launcher. How do I remove it?

When you view your apps on the Office 365 home page (https://home.office.com) or in the app launcher, a new tile named "Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector" will appear after installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. This tile provides no value in itself and can be safely hidden.

As an administrator, who has Microsoft Entra admin permissions, you can hide the tile by doing the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Enterprise apps**, then select **Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector**.
3. Select **Properties**, then set the **Visible To Users** switch to **No**.
4. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> It will be a while before this change takes effect.

## Duplicate text in the Share to Teams window

When you paste text into the message box in the **Share to Teams** window, the text is duplicated. This problem is known to Microsoft and will be addressed in a later update. 

## Unable to sign in to the Share to Teams window 

This problem can be caused by a various reasons. For example, the identity you are using to sign in must have access to Microsoft Teams, such as through a Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Can't pin a card to tab

Pinning is no longer available in Microsoft Teams.

## Someone added a tab, but the tab doesn’t show up for me

This problem is because you don’t have the BC app for Teams installed. Only those with the app installed will see Business Central tabs.

## Others see a different sorting or column layout than what the tab author sees

This problem is likely because you shared a list view that is a personal view. In this case, work with your administrator to create either role-specific list views that covers the different roles in the channel/chat, or create this view for the whole organization so that everyone can get a consistent view.

# The PayPal Payments Standard extension

The PayPal Payments Standard extension can help you increase your customer service levels by making it easier for your customers to pay their bills.

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, customers can pay through their PayPal account. When you send a sales invoice by email, there's a PayPal link in the email body and in the attached PDF document. If the customer chooses the link, the service page for their PayPal account opens and shows the payment details. The customer can then pay the invoice as any other PayPal payment.

The PayPal Payments Standard service provides the following benefits:

* Customer payments arrive faster in your bank account.
* Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
* PayPal offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on web sites.
* PayPal offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, PayPal accounts, and other sources.
* The PayPal link can be added automatically to sales documents or manually by the user.
* The PayPal Payments Standard service doesn't involve monthly fees or setup fees.
* Because it's an extension, you can easily enable the PayPal Payment Standard service when and if your business requires it.  

To learn more about how to set up the extension, go to [Enable Customer Payment Through PayPal](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

## Register payments automatically for business accounts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can register payments automatically if you have a Business Merchant account for the PayPal Commerce Platform. When your customers use the PayPal link to pay an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts the entries and close the document.

To use this capability, on the **Payment Registration Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Register payments automatically** toggle and verify the accounts you'll use for the payments. If you decide that you don't want to register payments automatically, you can turn it off again.

> [!TIP]
> Developers can use sandbox accounts to test the setup. To do that, change the PayPal URL to **sandbox.paypal.com**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the PayPals Instant Payment Notification (IPN) through notify_url.

# Business Central and Microsoft Teams Integration

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams) is a Microsoft 365 product that lets you connect with others, collaborate seamlessly, and simplify work. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers an app that connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you can quickly share details across team members, look up contacts, and respond faster to inquiries.

The app is available on the Teams marketplace, and you can use it with the Teams desktop, mobile app, or web.

## Features overview

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams offers the following features.

### Look up details of customers, vendors, and other contacts

No matter where you are in Teams, you can look up details about customers, vendors, and other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. This feature not only lets you view general information about contacts, but also gives access to interaction history, related documents, and more.

 [![Look up Business Central contacts from Teams command box.](media/teams-contacts-overview-2.png)](media/teams-contacts-overview-2.png#lightbox)

You can also share contact details in a conversation. From there, participants have access to even more details about the contact as well.

 [![Look up Business Central contacts from Teams compose box.](media/teams-contacts-2.png)](media/teams-contacts-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Searching for Contacts from Microsoft Teams](across-search-contacts-teams.md).

### Share records in conversations

Copy a link to any Business Central record and paste it into a Teams conversation to share with your coworkers. The app will then expand the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record.

[![Teams integration with Business Central.](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png)](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png#lightbox)

Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action - without leaving Teams.

Learn more in [Share Records in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md).

### Share links from pages in Business Central to Teams

Directly from most collection and details pages in Business Central, you can use the **Share to Teams** action from the ![!The Share menu icon on pages.](media/share-icon.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.") icon to type a message, choose recipients, such as team members, groups or channels, and send the message with a link and to the Business Central page.

<!--![!The Share menu displayed on a card.](media/teams-share-link.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.")-->

Learn more in [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

### Add a Business Central tab to Teams channel or chat

With the Business Central app for Teams installed, you can add a tab in a channel or chat the shows Business Central data from lists and card pages.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

# Record sustainability entries

You can manually record greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or water and waste intensity in the sustainability ledger by using sustainability journals. You can also use purchase documents or general journals to record GHG emissions.  

<!--> [!NOTE]
> Posting water and waste intensity and using general journals for posting emissions will be enabled starting *2025 release wave 1*.  -->

## Sustainability journals

Sustainability journals are designed to track and record sustainability-related activities by using the same user experience as other journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually enter emissions and water or waste intensity in a journal. Alternatively, if you don't have the information, you can use built-in formulas to accurately calculate emissions or water or waste intensity based on parameters that correspond to various types of sources and accounts.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in that journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where it can't be changed. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries.

### Use journal templates and batches

By default, there are standard and recurring sustainability journal templates.

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. To do so, select the **Batches** action on the **Sustainability Journal Templates** page, and then create the new **Sustainability Journal Batch** on the new page. For example, you can define your own journal batch for each emission scope by using the **Emission Scope** option and then selecting among the four existing scopes or **Water/Waste** option. For each batch, you can add or change the **Source Code** and **Reason Code** values.

> [!TIP]
> If you have many lines, you can help reduce the risk of mistakes by having one journal batch for each emission type. Alternatively, you can use the common batch for all emission types.

### Validate sustainability journals

On the **Sustainability Setup** page, you can turn on a background check to help prevent posting delays. If any mistakes occur while you work in the sustainability journal, the validation notifies you and prevents you from posting the journal.

When you enable the validation, the **Journal Check** FactBox shows issues on the current line and in the whole batch. Validation occurs when you load a journal batch and when you select another journal line. The **Issues Total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found. You can select the tile to open an overview of the issues.

### Work with sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you plan to post in the same batch.
3. For internal documents, you can leave the **Document Type** field blank. If not, you can select **Invoice**, **Credit Memo**, or **GHG Credit**.  
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use a batch where the emission scope is configured, the **Emission Scope** value in the sustainability account must equal the **Emission Scope** value in the batch.

5. You can either manually fill in the emission amounts or use formulas.

    - If you have accurate information about gas emission or water or waste intensity and want to post it (that is, if you have the information on the received invoice, or some other measured model), select the **Manual Input** field to indicate that you manually enter the amounts. In this case, you can't enter your data directly in the **Fuel/Electricity**, **Distance**, **Custom Amount**, **Installation Multiplier**, and **Time Factor** fields because they become uneditable. However, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields remain editable, and you can enter your data directly in them.
    - If you don't have accurate knowledge of the gas emission or water or waste intensity and must calculate it, don't select the **Manual Input** field. In this case, the **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, **Emission N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity** fields become uneditable. However, you can enter your calculation details based on the formula that you're using. To learn more about the formulas that are defined in the **sustainability account category**, go to [Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger](finance-sustainability-accounts-ledger.md#account-categories).  

6. To post the journal, select the **Post** action. When you post in a sustainability journal, entries are generated in the sustainability ledger.

> [!NOTE]
> For water and waste intensity calculation, you can only use a formula with the **Custom Amount** that's multiplied with the emission factor from the **Sustainability Account Subcategory**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your formula is based on the **Calculate from General Ledger** option in the sustainability account category, you must use the **Collect Amount from G/L Entries** action before you post the journal. The action calculates emissions based on this data source. Additionally, if you made changes to the emission factors after the journal lines were filled in, you must select the **Recalculate** action to get the correct amount in the journal.

### Changing account subcategories in the journal line  

You can have more than one **Account Subcategory** related to one **Sustainability Account**, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting. To use a different subcategory for each account, you can easily change this value on the **Sustainability Journal** line, but you can only select subcategories that are already associated with the specific account and account category.

> [!TIP]
> Here's an example. You want to use one account for different types of cars, but the cars have different emission factors. You can set up one account and create an account subcategory for each emission factor. When you work in your sustainability journal, you can easily change your account subcategory based on the car type you choose to use for recording emissions.

### Recurring journals

A recurring journal is a sustainability journal that has specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. Examples include sustainability transactions such as electricity or heat, or other similar transactions. You can use recurring journals to post fixed and variable amounts.

When you use a recurring journal, you create the entries that you regularly post only one time. Information such as the accounts, dimensions, and dimension values remain in the journal after posting. Each time that you post, you can make any changes that are needed.

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how the amount on the journal line is handled after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time that you post the line, you can select the **F Fixed** option to let the amount remain after posting. If you use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time that you post, you can select the **V Variable** option to delete the amount after posting.

The **Recurring Frequency** field is also important and must be set. It's a date formula field that determines how often the entry on the journal line is posted. Learn more in [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

The **Expiration Date** field determines the date when the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after that date. The advantage of using the **Expiration Date** field is that the line isn't immediately deleted from the journal. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future. If the field is blank, the line is posted every time, until you delete it from the journal.

## Purchase documents  

To enable recording of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in any purchase-related documents, you must select the **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** on the **Sustainability Setup** page. 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   - Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want the invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   - Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want the order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
2. Populate the header and lines based on the instructions in [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. If you have information about emissions on your invoice from the vendor, choose the appropriate **Sustainability Account No.** in the document lines and add emission values using one of the following fields (based on what you want to track and emissions you have on your physical invoice): **Emission CO2**, **Emission CH4**, or **Emission N2O**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values you enter in the emission fields are fixed amounts per line. They aren't multiplied with the **Quantity** field. You can use **Sustainability Account No.** only when the **Type** field (**Option Values**) is **Item** or **G/L Account**. You can't use **Resource** or **Charge (Item)** **Option Values**. 

4. If you want to review total emissions before posting, you can open the statistics page and find the total posted emissions and emissions for posting per document (any purchase-related documents) on the **Sustainability** FastTab.
5. Post the documents and open a new **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
6. Select the **Find Entries** action. You have a **Sustainability Ledger Entry** as one of the related entries on the **Find entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post the document, for each of the purchase lines where you have **Sustainability Account No.**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an independent **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **Invoice** as a **Document Type** and the same **Document No.**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create and post a **Purchase Credit Memo** manually, or by using the **Cancel**, **Correct**, or **Create Corrective Credit Memo** actions, in which case [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the existing values from the posted invoice.  

## General journals

You can use general journals to post gas emissions together with the financial amounts. This option is used if you want to post your incoming invoices using journals and not documents. In this situation, you can [use general journals](ui-work-general-journals.md) as usual, but before posting journals, you should add emissions. There isn't an option to use formulas in general journals. After you select the right **Sustainability Account No.** for the journal line, you can add only total emission amounts in the **Total Emission CO2**, **Total Emission CH4**, or **Total Emission N2O** fields. After you post, lines are recorded in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** and if you included a carbon equivalent calculation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select the **Sustainability Account No.** in the journal line only if **Document Type** for this line is **Invoice** or **Credit Memo**. For all other options, you can't select the **Sustainability Account No.** and post emissions.

# FAQ for Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Sales Order Agent feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## What is the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking items availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of the Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to the Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email
- Checking the availability of the items
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was the Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request, it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human user to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with the other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item", other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, Fixed Asset aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discounts requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document, for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by the Business Central own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Like any other user in Business Central, the Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to the specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by the Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change, for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

# Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory Valuation app pulls data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to provide business leaders key information about inventory across their organization. The app has various reports that offer insights into costing areas. The report can help you make informed decisions and ensure you account for costs.

## Inventory valuation analytics for leadership teams

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock costs

Chief executives want to identify locations that hold the most stock value. The [Inventory Valuation by Location](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-location.md) report can help you find that location. You can also break down this data by using the [Inventory Valuation by Item](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-item.md) report to explore the value of each item you have on hand.

## How to use the reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

The following table describes on how you can use each report in the app.

# Power BI Sales app semantic model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The semantic model in the Power BI sales app is organized in a [Star Schema Model](/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview).

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices, and posted credit memos from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The dimension tables provide more context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.

## Fact tables

Fact tables store transactional data and support summarizations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and more. There are two fact tables in the Power BI Sales app:

- [Sales](#sales)
- [Sales Budget](#sales-budget)

### Sales

The app uses data from the following tables:

- Value Entries
- Sales Lines

Sales lines are broken down into **Shipped Not Invoiced** and **Outstanding Sales Lines**. Use the **Source Type** field to filter on these sources.

#### Table Definition

# Use a Power Automate flow to timely synchronize Dataverse entity changes

Administrators can create an automated flow in Power Automate that notifies your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] about changes to records in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] organization.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you've connected your online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and scheduled synchronization between the two applications.

## Import the Flow Template

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to set up the flow, we've created a template that will define the flow trigger and flow condition for you. To use the template, follow the steps in this section. To create the flow yourself, skip this section and start with the steps in [Define the Flow Trigger](#define-the-flow-trigger).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
2. Choose **Templates**, and then search for **Notify Business Central**.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-import-template.png" alt-text="Keywords to find the flow template.":::
3. Choose the **Notify Business Central when an account changes** template.
4. Continue with the steps in the [Notify Business Central about a change](#notify-business-central-about-a-change) section.

## Define the Flow Trigger

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
2. Create an automated cloud flow that starts when a row for a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is added, modified, or deleted. For more information, see [Trigger flows when a row is added, modified, or deleted](/power-automate/dataverse/create-update-delete-trigger). This example uses the **Accounts** entity. The following image shows the settings for the first step in defining a flow trigger.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-trigger.png" alt-text="Settings for the flow's trigger":::
3. Use the **AssistEdit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
4. Choose **Show advanced options**, and in the **Filter Rows** field, enter **customertypecode eq 3** or **customertypecode eq 11** and **statecode eq 0**. These values mean that the trigger will react only when changes are made to active accounts of the type **customer** or **vendor**.

## Define the Flow Condition

Data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] through an integration user account. To ignore the changes made by the synchronization, create a condition step in your flow that excludes changes made by the integration user account.  

1. Add a **Get a row by ID from Dataverse** step after the flow trigger with the following settings. For more information, see [Get a row by ID from Dataverse](/power-automate/dataverse/get-row-id).

    1. In the **Table name** field, choose **Users**
    2. In the **Row ID** field, choose the **Modified By (Value)** from the flow trigger.  

2. Add a condition step with the following **or** settings to identify the integration user account.
    1. The user's **Primary Email Address** contains **contoso.com**
    2. The user's **Full Name** contains **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.

3. Add a Terminate control to stop the flow if the entity was changed by the integration user account.

The following image shows how to define the flow trigger and the flow condition.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse.png" alt-text="Overview of flow trigger and condition settings":::

## Notify Business Central About a Change

If the flow isn't stopped by the condition, you must notify [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that a change occurred. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector to do that.

1. In the **No** fork of the condition step, add an action and search for **Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. Choose the connector icon in the list.
2. Choose the **Create record (V3)** action.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-connector.png" alt-text="Settings for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector":::

3. Use the **assist edit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. When connected, fill in the **Environment name** and **Company name** fields.
5. In the **API category** field, enter **microsoft/dataverse/v1.0**.
6. In the **Table name** field, enter **dataverseEntityChanges**.
7. In the **entityName** field, enter **account**.
8. Save the flow.

The following image shows how your flow should look.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-summary.png" alt-text="Overview of all settings for the flow":::

When you add, delete, or modify an account in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment, this flow will do the following actions:

1. Call the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that you specified in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector.
2. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API to insert a record with the **entityName** set to **account** in the **Dataverse Entry Change** table. This parameter is the exact name of the Dataverse entity that you're creating the flow for.
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will start the job queue entry that synchronizes customers with accounts.

# Sharing Business Central records and page links in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple ways to share data from Business Central directly in a Microsoft Teams conversation:

- With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed in Teams, you can include an interactive card of any Business Central record in a Teams conversation.

- With or without the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed, you can share a link from pages in Business Central to a Teams conversation.

The following sections describe the different ways in detail.

## Include and view a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

With the Business Central app for Teams, you can copy a link from any Business Central record, like a customer or sales order, and paste the link into a Teams conversation. The app connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. It then expands the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record. Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action&mdash;without leaving Teams.

[![Teams integration with Business Central.](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png)](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central records that you submit to the conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

### Include a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using your browser.
2. Open the record that you want to share.

    The app is designed to display a card for almost any type of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page. But it provides the best experience when used for pages that display a single record, such as an item, customer, or sales order.
3. Copy the link to the page.

    There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. Alternatively, copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar.

    [![Copy Business Central URL from browser.](media/teams-copy-link.png)](media/teams-copy-link.png#lightbox)
4. Go to Teams and start a conversation, which can be chat with a person, group of persons, or a team channel.
5. Paste the link (URL) in the message box where you compose a message. You might need to add a space or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for the URL to be recognized.

    ![Paste Business Central URL in Teams.](media/teams-paste-url-v3.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get a message like: *Business Central wants to show a preview of this link.*, it means that you don't have the Business Central app for Teams installed. To install the app, select **Show Preview** and follow the instructions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your Business Central version, the first time you paste a link into a conversation, you might be asked to sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and give consent for the app to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll only have to do this step once.

6. Wait a moment while a card is generated in the message box.
7. When the card appears, review the contents of the card carefully for any sensitive information before sending the message. This step is important because once you send the message, everyone in the conversation can see the card.
8. If the card looks good, select **Send** to submit it to the conversation.
9. To view more details or make changes to the record shown in the card, select **Details**. Learn more in the next section.

### View card details

Once a card's been sent to a conversation, all participants with the [proper permissions](admin-teams-integration.md#permissions) can select **Details** to open a window that displays more information about the record&mdash;and possibly make changes to the record. It doesn't matter if you're the one sending the card or the one receiving the card. The **Details** feature is especially useful to recipients because it quickly provides concise, targeted information about the record.

The details window is similar to what you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but it's focused on the page or record that the card is about. When you're finished viewing and making changes, close the window to return to the Teams conversation.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when working with the card details:

- To open the card details, users must have permission on the page and its data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.
- Cards in Teams chats aren't automatically updated to changes. Any changes you save to a record in the details window are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. But the card in Teams won't show the changes in the conversion, until you paste the link again.

Learn more about working with cards and card details in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## <a name="share-link"></a>Share a link to page from Business Central to Teams

Directly from most collection pages, like the **Items** page, and details pages, like the **Items** card, you can send a link to the page to specific recipients in a Teams conversation. For example, you can share a link to a filtered view of your records. Recipients can then select the link to open the page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.

[![!The Share menu displayed on a card.](media/teams-share-link-v2.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.")](media/teams-share-link-v2.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- (Optional) You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

# Setting up fixed assets

Before you can work with fixed assets (FA), you need to define a few things:  

* How you depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record acquisition costs, depreciations, and other values in the general ledger.  
* Optionally, how to record insurance and maintenance on fixed assets.

The sections in this article link to more information about how to set up fixed assets. After you finish the setup, you can start working with fixed assets. For more information, see [Using Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** pages, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. The help articles for fixed assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page to post transactions for the activity.

## Required setup tasks

The following table contains a sequence of tasks to set up fixed assets, and links to related articles.

# Set Up Fault Reporting
Fault reporting lets you establish standards for recording fault information for service items. For example, you can specify what the problem is, the symptoms you see, the reason for the problem, and how to resolve it.  

Fault codes describe the typical service item faults or the actions taken on service items. Depending on the level of fault reporting in your company, you might need to set up fault area codes and symptom codes before you set up fault codes. Fault areas describe areas of service item faults. Fault reason codes describe the reason for service item faults and, if needed, whether to exclude warranty and contract discounts. For example, you might want to exclude warranty and contract discounts if the customer was somehow responsible for the fault in the service item. You assign fault reason codes to service orders. For more information, see [Work on Service Tasks](service-how-to-work-on-service-tasks.md).  

## To specify the overall level of fault reporting
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Fault Reporting Level** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  

    |**Fault Level**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |None | No reporting codes are used.|  
    |Fault | Codes are listed in the **Fault Codes** table. These codes identify service item faults or actions to take on service items. You can cluster related codes into **Fault Area Code** groupings.|  
    |Fault + Symptom | You provide a combination of codes in the **Fault Codes** and **Symptom Codes** tables. Typical symptom codes include indicators that a customer might use to describe a problem, such as a noise or a quality.|  
    |Fault + Symptom + Area | You use fault, symptom, and fault area codes as an implementation of the International Repair Coding System (IRIS).|  

To complete the setup of fault reporting, you can also specify what repairs or resolutions are associated with a fault or defect. You set that up on the **Fault/Resolution Code Relationships** page, where you set up combinations of codes for the service item group of the service item from which you accessed the window and the number of occurrences for each one.

## To create fault and resolution code relationships
<!--this needs to go in a working with topic-->
To be able to see the most common methods of repair for particular item faults when you are servicing the items, you need to build up information on fault/resolution codes relationships. Use the **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** batch job to find all the combination of fault and resolution codes in posted service orders and record them on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter dates to define the period you want to include in the batch job.  
3. To group the relationships by service item group, choose the **Relation Based on Service Item Group** check box.  
4. To retain the records that you have already inserted manually on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page, choose the **Retain Manually Inserted Rec.** check box.

# Reconcile customer payments from a list of unpaid sales documents

After customers make electronic payments to your bank account, you must take the following actions:

* Apply each paid amount to the related sales document.
* Post the payment to update the customer, general ledger, and bank ledger entries.

Depending on your business needs, you can register payments manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can do the same tasks, including vendor payments, on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. For example, you can import bank statements, use automatic application, and reconcile bank accounts. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Use the **Register Customer Payments** page to balance internal accounts by using actual cash figures to ensure that payments are collected. You can quickly verify and post individual or lump-sum payments, process discounted payments, and find the unpaid documents.

You must post payments for different customers that have different payment dates as individual payments. Payments for the same customer that have the same payment date can be posted as a lump-sum payment. Lump-sum payments are useful, for example, when a customer made a single payment that covers multiple sales invoices.

## To set up the payment registration journal

Because you can post different payment types to different balancing accounts, you must select a balancing account on the **Payment Registration Setup** page before you start processing customer payments. If you always post to the same balancing account, you can set that account as the default and avoid this step every time that you open the **Register Customer Payments** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link. You can also choose the **Setup** action on the **Register Customer Payments** page.
2. Fill in the fields on the **Payment Registration Setup** page. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to later identify entries that were posted through the journal, you can assign a specific number series to the payment journal. The number series is useful if you use payment reconciliation journals to register and apply payments.

## To register customer payments individually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **Register Customer Payments** page shows all posted documents for which a payment can be registered. You can also open the page from the **Customers** and **Customer Card** pages, filtered for the specified customer.  
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the line that represents the posted document for which a payment was made.
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

   If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter the amount that was paid.

    For full payments, this amount is the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line. For partial payments, this amount is lower than the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines for posted documents for which payments are made.  
6. Choose the **Post Payments** action.  

The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payments entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.

## To reconcile lump-sum payments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the lines for posted documents for the same customer and for which a lump-sum payment was made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The customer in the **Name** field must be the same on all lines to include in the lump-sum payment.  

    If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This date must be the same on all lines that will be posted as a lump-som payment.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter amounts on multiple lines that sum up to the lump payment amount.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Try to post as many full payments as possible with the lump-sum amount. Enter amounts that are the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on as many lines as possible.  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines that represent posted documents for the same customer for which a lump-sum payment was made.  
6. Choose the **Post As Lump Payment** action.

   The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payment entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts. Each payment is applied to the related posted sales document.  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, it might be because the related document isn't posted. In that case, you can use a search function to quickly find the document and post it to process the payment. For more information, see [To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced](#to-find-a-specific-sales-document-that-isnt-fully-invoiced).  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved. For more information, see [To record or post a payment without a related document](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-record-or-post-a-payment-without-a-related-document).  

## To process customer payments with discounts manually

If you agree on a payment discount with your customer, payment amounts can be lower than the invoice amounts if payment occurs before the agreed discount date.  

The following procedures explain ways to post discounted payments on the **Payment Registration** page.  

* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, and the payment date is before the discount date. You post the payment as is.  
* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, but the payment date is after the discount date. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount. You can also set the discount date later to allow the payment in full.  
* The payment amount is lower than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount.  
* The payment amount is more than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payments as is. Only the remaining amount is posted. The extra amount is credited to the customer.  

### To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount and where the payment date is before the discount date

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Payment Made** checkbox is automatically selected, and the **Date Received** field is filled with the work date.
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter a payment date that is after the date in the **Pmt. Discount Date** field.

   Date fields change to red font, and an error message is shown at the bottom of the page. The next two steps fix that.
4. Choose the **Details** action.  
5. On the **Payment Registration Details** page, in the **Pmt. Discount Date** field on the **Payment Discount** FastTab, enter a date that is after the date in the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration Setup** page.  

    The error message and the red font disappear, and you can continue to process the discounted payment.
6. Verify that the **Remaining Amount** field contains the amount that remains to pay the full invoice amount.  
7. Choose the **Post Payments** action to post the partial payment to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.  

The related document remains open.

### To process a payment that is lower than the remaining discounted amount

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter the payment amount in the **Amount Received** field. The amount is lower than the amount in the **Rem. Amount Incl. Discount** field.

    The **Payment Made** checkbox is automatically selected, and the **Date Received** field is filled with the work date.  
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the payment date. The date is before the date in the **Pmt. Discount Date** field.
4. Verify that the **Remaining Amount** field contains the amount that remains to pay the discounted amount.  
5. Choose the **Post Payments** action to post the partial payment to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.

4. Verify that the **Remaining Amount** field contains zero (0).  
5. Choose the **Post Payments** action to post the full payment to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.  

The related document is closed, and the customer is credited the excess payment amount.  

## To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced

The **Register Customer Payments** page supports you in tasks needed to balance internal accounts with actual cash figures to ensure effective collection from customers. It shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment.  

Typically, when a payment is made, recorded in the bank or otherwise, the sales or purchase document is represented as a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page. The document is waiting for you to post the payment to the outstanding amount. However, sometimes a payment that was made isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, typically because the document isn't fully invoiced.

Use the **Search Documents** action to search for documents that aren't fully invoiced. You can search based on one or more of the following criteria:  

* Document number  
* Amount or amount range  

The following procedure explains how to find a specific document by using both search criteria.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. With the pointer on any line, Choose the **Search Documents** action.
3. On the **Document Search** page, enter a search value in the **Document No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The value that you enter in this field is enclosed in hidden wildcard characters. This means that the action searches for all document numbers that contain the entered value.
4. In the **Amount** field, enter the specific amount on the document you want to find.  
5. In the **Amount Tolerance %** field, enter a percentage value to define the range of amounts that you want to search to find the open document.  

    If you enter 10, the action searches for amounts in a range of plus or minus 10 percent of the value in the **Amount** field.
6. Choose the **Search** action.  

If one or more documents match the criteria, the **Document Search Result** page opens to display lines that represent those documents. Each line contains a document number, description, and an amount.

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the  open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

## To record or post a payment without a related document

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the **General Journal** action to open a prefilled general journal line from the **Register Customer Payments** page. Use the journal to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **General Journal** action.  

    The **General Journal** page opens with one line that contains the balancing account of the journal batch that is set up on the **Payment Registration Setup** page.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the general journal line. For example, provide the amount, customer number, or information from the bank statement. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

You can post the journal line to update the total on the balancing account. You can also leave the journal line unposted, and perhaps append it with a note that the payment needs more analysis.  

If you don't post the journal line, its value is added to the value in the **Rem. Amount Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Registration** page.

# Design Details: Production Order Posting
Similar to assembly order posting, the consumed components and the used machine time are converted and output as the produced item when the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.


Transactions that occur during the manufacturing process can be tracked through the following stages:  

1.  Purchase of materials and other manufacturing inputs.  
2.  Conversion into work in process.  
3.  Conversion into finished goods inventory.  
4.  Sale of finished goods.  

Therefore, apart from regular inventory accounts, a manufacturing company must establish three separate inventory accounts to record transactions at various stages of production.  

|Inventory Account|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Raw Materials account**|Includes the cost of raw materials that are purchased but not yet transferred to production. The balance in the Raw Materials account indicates the cost of raw materials on hand.<br /><br /> When raw materials move into the production department, the cost of the materials is transferred from the Raw Materials account to the WIP account.|  
|**Work in Process (WIP) account**|Accumulates the costs that are incurred during production in the accounting period. The WIP account is debited for the cost of raw materials that are transferred from the raw materials warehouse, the cost of direct labor performed, and the manufacturing overhead costs that are incurred.<br /><br /> The WIP account is credited for the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed in the factory and transferred to the finished goods warehouse.|  
|**Finished Goods account**|This account includes the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed but not yet sold. At the time of sale, the cost of units sold is transferred from the Finished Goods account to the Cost of Goods Sold account.|  

The inventory value is calculated by tracking the costs of all increases and decreases, as expressed by the following equation:  

* inventory value = beginning balance of inventory + value of all increases - value of all decreases  

Depending on the type of inventory, increases and decreases are represented by different transactions.  

||Increases|Decreases|  
|-|---------------|---------------|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  
|**WIP inventory**|-   Material consumption<br />-   Capacity consumption<br />-   Manufacturing overhead|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|  
|**Finished goods inventory**|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|-   Sales (cost of goods sold)<br />-   Negative output|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  

The values of increases and decreases are recorded in the different types of manufactured inventory in the same way as for purchased inventory. Every time a transaction of inventory increase or decrease takes place, an item ledger entry and a corresponding general ledger entry are created for the amount. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

Although values of transactions that are related to purchased goods are posted only as item ledger entries with related value entries, transactions that are related to produced items are posted as capacity ledger entries with related value entries, in addition to the item ledger entries.  

## Posting Structure  
Posting production orders to WIP inventory involves output, consumption, and capacity.  

The following diagram shows the involved posting routines in codeunit 22.  

![Production order posting routines.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_1.png "Production order posting routines")  

The following diagram shows the associations between the resulting entries and the cost objects.  

![Production entry flow.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_2.png "Production entry flow")  

The capacity ledger entry describes the capacity consumption in terms of time units, whereas the related value entry describes the value of the specific capacity consumption.  

The item ledger entry describes the material consumption or output in terms of quantities, whereas the related value entry describes the value of this specific material consumption or output.  

A value entry that describes WIP inventory value can be associated with one of the following combinations of cost objects:  

-   A production order line, a work or machine center, and a capacity ledger entry.  
-   A production order line, an item, and an item ledger entry.  
-   Only a production order line  

For more information about how costs from production and assembly are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Capacity Posting  
Posting output from the last production order routing line results in a capacity ledger entry for the end item, in addition to its inventory increase.  

 The capacity ledger entry is a record of the time that was spent to produce the item. The related value entry describes the increase of the WIP inventory value, which is the value of the conversion cost. For more information, see “From the Capacity Ledger” in [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Production Order Costing  
 To control inventory and production costs, a manufacturing company must measure the cost of production orders, because the predetermined standard cost of each produced item is capitalized in the balance sheet. For information about why produced items use the Standard costing method, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In environments that do not use the Standard costing method, the actual rather than the standard cost of produced items is capitalized on the balance sheet.  

The actual cost of a production order consists of the following cost components:  

-   Actual material cost  
-   Actual capacity cost or subcontractor cost  
-   Manufacturing overhead  

These actual costs are posted to the production order and compared to the standard cost to calculate variances. Variances are calculated for each of the item cost components: raw materials, capacity, subcontractor, capacity overhead, and manufacturing overhead. The variances can be analyzed to determine problems, such as excessive waste in processing.  

In standard-cost environments, the costing of a production order is based on the following mechanism:  

1.  When the last routing operation is posted, the production order cost is posted to the item ledger and set to the expected cost.  

    This cost equals the output quantity that is posted in the output journal multiplied by the standard cost that is copied from the item card. The cost is treated as expected cost until the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This differs from assembly order posting, which always posts actual costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  
2.  When the production order is set to **Finished**, the order is invoiced by running the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. As a result, the total cost of the order is calculated based on the standard cost of the consumed materials and capacity. The variances between the calculated standard costs and the actual production costs are calculated and posted.

> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For more information, see [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).  

Choose an app to learn about what it does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to its terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, you'll be signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. Some apps require that you provide some information before you can use them. For example, after you install the **PayPal Payments Standard** app, you must specify the email or the Merchant account ID for your PayPal account. To set up an app, or to find out what information you'll need, on the **Installed Extensions** page, choose the **Set up** action.  

Other apps simply add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. The data is available if you install the app again.

Some apps are provided by Microsoft, and other apps are provided by [other companies](ui-extensions-other.md). We recommend that you learn more about the app before you choose to install it.

Microsoft provides the following apps:

## Set up an app

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. For example, for the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app you must specify the PayPal account to use. If that's the case, when installation completes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to set up the app right away. Setups can be required for the app to work, or optional.

If you choose to set up your app right away, and it has a required setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will open the required setup. The setup can be either a page where you enter information, or an assisted setup guide that helps you through the steps. If you don't complete the setup in one go, you can use the **Setups for _name of app_** page, which lists all setups for the app. Required setups indicated by **bold letters**.

## Upload a per-tenant extension (PTE)

You upload a PTE by using the **Extension Management** page. On the **Extension Management** page, go to **Manage**, then choose **Upload Extension**. On the **Upload and Deploy Extension** page, specify the .app file to upload. To proceed, choose the **Accept** button, and then the **Deploy** button, which will start the process of deploying the PTE.

If the PTE contains breaking schema changes, it's possible to *force* an upload of it. To do that, in **Schema Sync Mode** choose the **Force** option. You'll get a confirmation dialog to accept before proceeding.  

## Uninstall an app

You uninstall an app by using the **Extension Management** page. To uninstall an app, select it on the page, then select the **Uninstall** action. If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install the app again.

By default, when you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. If you're sure you won't install the app again, and you can delete the data when you uninstall it. To delete data when you uninstall an app, turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle. You'll get a confirmation dialog, and you must choose **Yes** to turn it on. After the **Delete Extension Data** switch is turned on, you can uninstall the app, and you'll be asked to reconfirm that you want to uninstall the app and delete the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> * There might be apps that require or depend on the app that you want to uninstall. These apps are referred to as *dependents*. You can't uninstall an app unless you also uninstall its dependents. When you uninstall an app that has dependents, a dialog lists the dependents. To continue, you'll have to select **Yes** to uninstall the app and its dependents.
> * If you turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle, uninstalling the app will delete all data for the app *plus* data for all dependent apps. The action can't be undone.
> * Some apps are required and you can't delete them on the **Extension Management** page.  

If you want to keep the data for an uninstalled app, you can delete the data later. The **Delete Orphaned Extension Data** page lists the apps that you still have data for. To delete the data, choose the app, and then choose **Delete Data**.

# Use resources for projects

You record the usage of resources in the project journal to keep track of costs, prices, and the work types that are linked to projects. For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

You can also post the usage of a resource in a resource journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.

## To assign resources to projects

You assign resources to projects by creating project planning lines for the project. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

## To record resource usage for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project journal batch, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

# Run and print reports in Business Central

Reports help you collect and display data based on specific criteria. It organizes and presents the information in an easy-to-read format you can print or save as a file. There are many reports you can access throughout the application. The reports typically provide information related to the context of the page you're on. For example, the **Customer** page includes reports for the top 10 customers, sales statistics, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Batch jobs and XMLports do more or less the same as reports, but are used more to process or export data. For example, the **Create Reminders** batch job creates reminder documents to send to customers with overdue payments. This article refers mainly to "reports", but similar information applies to batch jobs and XMLports.

## Get started

You can find reports in the **Reports** menu on selected pages, lists, and cards. You can also use the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") to find reports by name. For an overview of built-in reports, you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], sorted by categories, see [Available Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](reports-available-reports.md).

When you choose a report, you see a request page titled after the report's name where you set various options and filters that determine what data is included. The following sections explain how to use the request page to build, preview, and print a report.

## <a name="SavedSettings"></a>Use default values&mdash;predefined settings

Most report request pages include the **Use default values from** field. With this field, you can select predefined settings for the report, which automatically set options and filters. Select an entry from the dropdown list to see the options and filters on the report request page change accordingly.

The entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use the options and filters you used the last time you ran the report.

The **Use default values from** field provides a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. After you select an entry, you can change any of the options and filters before you preview or print the report. The changes you make won't be saved to the predefined settings entry you selected, but they'll be saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

> [!NOTE]
> The predefined settings are typically set up and managed by an administrator. Learn more in [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

## Specify the data to include in a report

Use the fields under **Options** and **Filters** to change or limit the information you want in the report. You can set filters in a report in more or less the same way as you set filters on lists. Learn more in the [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Filter** FastTab on a report request page provides a generic filtering capability for reports. These filters are optional.
>
> Some reports ignore any such filters, which means no matter what filter is set in the **Filter** FastTab, the output of the report is the same. It's not possible to provide a list of which fields are ignored in which reports, so you'll have to experiment with the filters when using them.
>
> **Example**: When you use the **Create Reminders** batch job, a filter for the **Customer Ledger Entries** field of **Last Issued Reminder Level** is ignored because filters are fixed for that batch job.

## Preview a report

By previewing a report, you can see what the report looks like before you print it. The preview isn't based on the printer selected in the **Printer** field on the request page. It's controlled by the browser. After previewing, you can then go back to the request page and make changes to options and filters as you need.

The preview choices on the **Report Request** page depend on the report. So, for some reports, you can select **Preview**, while for others, the choice is **Preview & Close**. Both choices open a preview of the report. The difference is that **Preview** keeps the request page open, so you can go back to it, make changes, preview again, or print. In contrast, with **Preview & Close** the request page closes, and you have to open the report again to make changes or print.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2020 release wave 1 or earlier, the only choice is **Preview**, which closes the request page on preview, as described for **Preview & Close**.

### Work with the preview

In the preview, use the menu bar on the report preview to:

- Move through pages
- Zoom in and out
- Resize to fit the page
- Select text
  
  You can copy text from a report, then paste it somewhere else, such as a page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Microsoft Word. Using a mouse, for example, select the left mouse button and hold where you want to start. Slide the mouse to select one or more words, sentences, or paragraphs. Then select the right mouse button and select **Copy**. You can now paste the selected text where you want it.

- Pan the document
  
  You can move the visible area of the report in any direction to view other areas of the report. Panning is helpful when you zoom in to see details. Using your mouse, for example, select and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the report preview, and then move your mouse to select a section of the report.

- Download to a PDF file on your computer or network.
- Print

## Save a report to a file

You can save a report to a PDF document, Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel workbook, or XML document by choosing **Send to**, then making your selection. A file is downloaded to your computer.

If your organization configured OneDrive for system features, instead of being downloaded, Excel workbooks and Word documents are opened in your browser using either Excel or Word for the web.

> [!TIP]
> The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** and **XML Document** options are mostly for advanced purposes. You'd typically use these options to do detailed data analysis. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel and XML](report-analyze-excel.md).
>
> You can also use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** to create new Excel layouts for a given report. Learn more at [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).  

## <a name="ScheduleReport"></a> Schedule a report to run later or periodically

You can schedule a single or recurring report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. Select the **Schedule** option after selecting **Send to**, then enter information, such as the printer, and time and date. The report is added to the job queue and runs at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item is removed from the job queue. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

When you schedule a report to run, you can specify, for example, that it must run every Thursday by setting the **Next Run Date Formula** field to *D4*. Learn more in the [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas) section.  

You can save the report to a file (such as Excel, Word, or PDF), print it, or only generate the report. If you save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** page on your Role Center for you to view it. Learn more at [Share and Export Reports with the Report Inbox](ui-work-report-inbox.md)

### Manage scheduled recurring reports

Batch jobs generate scheduled reports managed on the **Job Queue Entries** page. You can see each report's status and other information on the page, pause/resume the report batch job, and generate the report on demand.

From the **Job Queue Entries** page, you can also change some report parameters, such as the output file type, recurrence, run date, and starting and ending times. Before you edit an existing scheduled report, however, it's necessary to put the report job queue on hold:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, then select the related link.  
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select the desired report.
3. Select the **Set On Hold** action.
4. Open and edit the scheduled report by selecting its status (*On Hold*).

After you edit the report options, repeat the first two steps and then select the **Set Status to Ready** action to resume generating the report.

Learn more about job queue management at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## <a name="PrintReport"></a>Print a report

To print a report, select **Print** on the report request page or on the menu bar of the **Preview** page.

When a report uses an Excel layout, you don't have the **Printer** field or **Print** or **Preview** buttons. Instead, there's a **Download** option. To print, select **Download**, then open the downloaded file in Excel and print from there.

### <a name="Printer"></a>Printer

The **Printer** field on the request page shows the name of printer the report is sent to. To change a printer, just select the printer from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The **(Handled by the browser)** option indicates there's no designated printer for the report. In this case, the browser handles the printout and displays the standard printing steps, where you can choose a local printer connected to your computer. The **(Handled by the browser)** option isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app or app for Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> The printer selected for you by default is set up on the **Printer Selections** page. Learn more about how you can change the default printer in the [Set up default printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md#default) section.

### Print reports in Thai

Specifically for the Thai version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the **Print** button can't print reports correctly because of limitations in the service that generates the printable PDF file. Instead, you can open the report in Word and then save the report as a printable PDF.  

Or, you can ask your administrator to create a Word report layout for your most used reports. Learn more at [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

## Switch the report layout

A report layout controls what is shown on a report, how it's arranged, and how it's styled. There are a few ways to change the layout:

- When you're setting up to run a report, you'll see the current layout in the **Report Layout** field on the request page. To temporarily switch to a different layout, select the **Report Layout** field, then select from a list of available layouts for the report.
- To change the default layout used by a report, go to either the **Report Layouts** or **Report Layout Selection** pages.

Learn more at [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md). Or, if you want to customize your own report layout, see [Get Started Creating Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

## Change language and format of numbers, dates, and times

By default, the language of text and format of numbers, dates, and times in a report are based on your working language and region settings, which are defined on the **My Settings** page. You can, however, change the language and format region on a case-by-case basis when you preview, print, or send a report. On the request page, set the **Language** and **Format Region** options to your preference. You can also specify the language and region format to use by default for customers and vendors on their card pages.

Depending on where you've specified the language and format settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] determines the settings to use in the following order:

1. The settings you specify when you generate a report.
2. The settings specified on the document, which come from the customer or vendor's settings.
3. The settings specified on the Report AL object.
4. The settings defined in My Settings.

For more information about the **My Settings** page, see [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

## Advanced options

The fields under the **Advanced** FastTab set limitations on the generated report to control printer resources. You typically won't have to change these settings, unless you have a large report. If a report exceeds these limitations when you try to preview or print, a message indicates which limitation you've exceeded. You can then change the settings to suit your report. Each field, however, has a maximum value you should be aware of:

|Field|Maximum value|
|-----|-------------|
|Maximum rendering time|12:00:00|
|Maximum rows|1000000|
|Maximum documents|500|

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum values might be different for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and an administrator can change them. Learn more in the [Configuring Business Central Server - Reports](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#Reports) section. For an overview of report limitations in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, see [Operational Limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online).

## Get help for a report

You can get help using a report in two ways: teaching tips and help pane.

### Teaching tip for a report

Many reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a teaching tip to increase your chance of success with the report. The title and description of these teaching tips try to answer the following hypothetical questions:

- What is this report about?
- What can I do with this report?

With teaching tips, the report creator helps you understand the logic relevant to the report, allowing you to start your reporting task immediately without being blocked. After you dismiss a teaching tip, you can select or hover over the report title on the request page to reopen the teaching tip.

Learn more in [In-product tips](product-help-and-support.md#in-product-tips)

### Help pane for a report

When the report request page is open, select the **Help** question mark in the top-right corner of the role center to open the help pane. Here, you find the teaching tip text (if defined on the report). You also find relevant links to documentation articles that explain related topics in more depth.

Learn more in [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane)

A purchase quote can be used as a preliminary draft for a purchase order, which can then be converted to a purchase invoice.

## Create a purchase quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Quotes**, then choose the related link.
2. Create a new document, in the same way as you make a purchase order. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

## Convert a purchase quote to a purchase order

When you have accepted the vendor's quote, you can convert it to a purchase order to process the purchase.

1. Open the purchase quote you want to convert, then choose the **Make Order** action.

The purchase quote is removed from the database. A purchase order is created based on the information in the purchase quote, which you can use to process the purchase, and then post a purchase invoice. In the **Quote No.** field on both the purchase order and purchase invoice you can see the number of the purchase quote they were made from.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to convert a purchase quote to a purchase invoice directly, like it is possible with sales quotes. For details on how to create a purchase invoice, read [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.

# Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users

As an administrator, you can set up Cues that appear on the users' Role Centers to include an indicator that changes color based on the data values in the Cues.  

The indicator appears as a colored bar along the top border of the Cue tile. It provides a visual signal of the status of the Cue's activity, which can indicate favorable or unfavorable conditions to prompt the user to take action. For example, if a Cue displays ongoing sales invoices, you can set up the indicator to appear green (favorable) when total number of ongoing sales invoices is below 10, and appears red (unfavorable) when the total is greater than 20.  

From the **Cue Setup** page, you set up indicators for all the Cues that are available in the company database. You can set up the indicators to apply to all users in the company or an individual user only. The indicator settings on the **Cue Setup** page act as the default indicator settings. If the **Cue Setup End User** page is made available to users, then they can personalize the indicators settings that you define on the **Cue Setup** page.  

To set up the indicator, you specify up to two threshold values that define three ranges of data values (low, middle, and high) to which you can apply a different color (or style).  

### To set up colored indicators on Cues  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cue Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

     The **Cue Setup** page appears. The page lists the indicators that are currently setup up on Cues. Indicators that apply to all users in the company have a blank **User Name** field. Indicators that apply to a specific user include the user's name in the **User Name** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you set up a company-wide indicator and a user modifies the indicator later on, then a separate entry for the indicator appears in list for that user.  

2. Choose **Edit List** action.  
3. To set up an indicator for a Cue that is not listed on the page, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following. If you want to modify an existing indicator, go to the next step.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**User Name**|If you want to set up the indicator for all users, leave this field blank.<br /><br /> If you want to set up the indicator for a specific user, then set this field to the user name.|  
    |**Table No**|Specifies the ID of the table object that contains the Cue. Use the drop down list to find the table. The drop down list includes all Cue tables in the company database.<br /><br /> The **Table Name** field will be automatically filled in based on your selection.|  
    |**Field No**|Specifies the ID of the Cue that you want to set up an indicator on. Use the drop down list to find the Cue that you want. **Note:**  The Cue ID corresponds to the field number that is assigned to the Cue in the table. <br /><br /> The **Field Name** field is automatically filled in based on your selection|  

4. To set up the indicator for a Cue, set the fields as described in the following table.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**LowStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when the Cue's value is below the value of the **Threshold 1** field.|  
    |**LowThreshold**|Specifies the value at or above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **Middle Range Style** field.|  
    |**MiddleStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when Cue's value is greater than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 1** field but less than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  
    |**HighThreshold**|Specifies the value above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **High Range Style** field.|  
    |**HighStyle**|Specifies the color to use when the Cue's value is above the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  

     The following table lists the colors that correspond to the options of the **LowStyle**, **MiddleStyle**, and **HighStyle** fields.  

    |  Option  |  Color  |  
    |----------|---------|  
    |**None**|No color (same color as the Cue tile)|  
    |**Favorable**|Green|  
    |**Unfavorable**|Red|  
    |**Ambiguous**|Yellow|  
    |**Subordinate**|Gray|

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze inventory data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "expiring stock" or "top sellers," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of inventory processes:

- [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis)

## Inventory ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of inventory scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

   > If you add the Posting Date field, you can also track movements over time.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on inventory

When you post a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries.

- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables. To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the purchase line is of the Item type). In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables. To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

# Set Up Complex Application Areas Using Best Practices
Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software.  

 Whether you use Rapid Start to implement setup values or you manually enter them in the new company, you can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

 Help in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes best-practice information about how to set up key fields in the following application areas:  

-   [Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning](setup-best-practices-supply-planning.md)

# Exchanging Data
You can exchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external files or streams in connection with common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the data files or streams. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, and the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you distribute bank file conversions to an external service provider. For more information, see [Setting Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md).

# Walkthrough conducting a sales campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This increases the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers (contacts) in a follow-up campaign.  

 The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales & Marketing department. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Preparing the data.
- Setting up a campaign.  
- Selecting the target audience.  
- Mining data.  
- Sending letters to contacts.  
- Registering campaign responses.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager  
- Marketing Staffer  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. The marketing manager also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting up a campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the target audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use various criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too large. The manager decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to focus on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a segment to a campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending letters and email messages to contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

> [!NOTE]  
> If needed click on the **Edit Pencil** icon to open the page in edit mode.

1. Open the **Segment** card for the **Visitors at the FUTURUS trade show**.  
2. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template code **BUS** and select **Yes**.
3. Choose the **Language Code (Default)** field to open the **Segment Interaction Languages** page. Select a **Language Code** and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Make sure that the **Correspondence Type (Default)** is set to **Hard Copy**.
5. In the **Attachment** field, select the **Ellipsis** box. This opens the Import Attachment dialog.
    1. Select the **Choose** button to choose your file.
    1. Find the file and select the **Open** button to attach it.
6. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**. Select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to leave the field, and select the **Yes** button.
7. Slide the **Send Word Docs as Attmt** to on and select the **Yes** button.
8. Choose the action **Log**. In the Log Segment pop-up window enable:
 **Create Follow-up Segment**
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the **Log Segment batch job**.  

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.  

Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Interaction Log Entries**, and then choose the related link. There's an entry for each sent letter.  

### To send an email message to a contact  

1. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template, code **BUS**.  
2. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**.  
3. In the **Correspondence Type** field, choose **E-Mail**.  
4. Specify language settings, and attach a Word document, as in the previous procedure.  
5. Choose the **Log** action. The **Log Segment** page opens.  
6. Select the **Send Attachments** check box to have the attachments sent by email.  
7. Select the **Create Follow-up Segment** check box.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

 The letters are automatically sent by email, and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is saved in the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Register campaign responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and records these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.  

 There's no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns. Therefore, create a new template.  

2. On the **Interaction Templates** dropdown, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter **RESP**, and in the **Description** field, enter **Campaign Responses**.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to apply this interaction template code to all segment lines.
6. On the **Campaign** FastTab, select the **Campaign Response** field. Choose **Yes** to confirm the message *You have modified Campaign Response*.  
7. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Log** action.  
8. On the **Log Segment** page, clear the **Send Attachments** check box. Then choose the **OK** button to confirm the message that the segment has been logged.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# Remove and reapply item ledger entries
On the **Application Worksheet** page, you can view and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.  

When you post a transaction where items are moved in or out of inventory, an item application is created between each inventory increase and inventory decrease. These applications determine the flow of costs from the goods that are received in inventory to the cost of goods going out of inventory. Because of the way the unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and a skewed unit cost. For more information, see Design Details: Item Application.

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries:

- You have forgotten to make a fixed application.
- You have made an incorrect fixed application.
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied.

If possible, use a document to reapply an item ledger entry. For example, if you must make a purchase return of an item to which a sale has already been applied, you can reapply by creating and posting the purchase return document by using the correct application in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return line. You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function or the **Copy from Document** function in the purchase return document to make this easier. When you post the document, the item ledger entry is automatically reapplied. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

If you can't use a document to reapply, such as when you have to correct a fixed application, then use the **Application Worksheet** page to correct an application.

> [!Warning]  
> The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet:
    - You should not leave application entries unapplied for long periods of time because other users cannot process the items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. Users who try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry receive the following error message: “You cannot perform this action because entries for item XXX are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user XXX.”
    - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items.
    - When you close the application worksheet, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performs a check to make sure that all entries are applied. For example, if you remove a quantity application but do not create a new application, and then you close the application worksheet, a new application is created. This helps keep the cost intact. However, if you remove a fixed application, a new fixed application is not automatically created when you close the worksheet. You must do this manually by creating a new application in the worksheet.
    - It is possible to remove applications from more than one entry at a time in the application worksheet. However, because applying entries affects the set of entries that are available for application, you cannot create an application for more than one entry at a time.
    - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation: If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply, the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information.

## To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  Enter filters on the **General** FastTab to make it easier to find the item ledger entry for which you want to change the application.  
4.  Select the item ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page opens to show the item ledger entry or entries that are currently applied to the selected entry.  
5.  Select the item ledger entry for which you want to remove the application.  
6.  Choose the **Remove Application** action. This removes the item application entry that links the two item ledger entries and moves it to the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  
7.  Close the **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page.  

 The **Remaining Quantity** field of the two item ledger entries is increased by the quantity that has been unapplied. The removed item ledger entry is now available for reapplication on the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not leave application entries unapplied for longer periods of time because other users cannot process the affected items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. The following error message is displayed if you try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry:  
>   
>  **You cannot perform this action because entries for item \<item\> are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user \<user\>.**  

## To reapply an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  To reapply entries that were removed since the worksheet was opened, select the item ledger entry that you want to reapply, and then choose the **Reapply** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This reapplication to the original balance also occurs automatically when you close the **Application Worksheet** page.  
4.  To apply an available open item ledger entry to another entry, select the item ledger entry that you want to apply. Choose the **Unapplied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page opens.  
5.  Select one or more item ledger entries that you want to apply to the entry selected on the **Application Worksheet** page, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     An item application entry is created between the two item ledger entries. The **Remaining Quantity** fields of the two entries are reduced by the applied quantity.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have chosen to make an application that would create an infinite loop in the cost adjustment process, then the application that you proposed is not made. This can occur when the original entries created negative stock. The application is not made. Therefore, you must select a different entry for the application.  
6.  If the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field in the **Inventory Setup** is set to **Always**, then the cost adjustment batch job is automatically run after you make a reapplication. Otherwise, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to make sure that all costs are up to date.

# Merge duplicate records

As different users create new customer, vendor, or contact cards over time, or the new records are created automatically during migration, a customer, vendor, or contact may be represented in the system with more than one record. In this case, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and provides functions to select which values to keep or discard when merging two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, a duplicate is indicated by the page showing very few fields. Whereas, if the page shows many fields, then the suspected record is probably not a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor  and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you have opened, indicated in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only, however, if merge conflicts exist, you'll resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field will then be transferred to the current record when you complete the process.
6. When you have finished selecting which values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    The system checks if the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes any conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all usage of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table will be replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge.** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which will appear if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Maintain fixed assets

Maintenance costs are operating expenses for the things you do to preserve the condition of your fixed assets. Unlike capital improvements, maintenance doesn't increase the value of your assets.

Each time you send a fixed asset for service, you record information such as the service date, the vendor who did the work, and the service agent's phone number. You enter maintenance information on several pages:

* Fixed Asset Card
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Invoice
* Fixed Asset G/L Journal

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** action to recalculate maintenance costs.

## Record a maintenance cost directly on a fixed asset

Every time you do maintenance for an asset, such as a service visit, you can record it on the **Maintenance Registrations** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to record maintenance for, and then choose the **Maintenance Registration** action.
3. On the **Maintenance Registration** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Post maintenance costs from a fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Book List**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that is assigned to the fixed asset, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, make sure the **Maintenance** checkbox isn't selected so that you don't post maintenance costs to the general ledger.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
6. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Maintenance**.
7. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for maintenance posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Step 7 only works if you set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Maintenance Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Maintenance Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
8. Choose the **Post** action.

## Record maintenance cost from a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to record maintenance costs for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for purchase orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
4. In the **No.** field, choose the asset, and then specify the quantity and cost.
5. In the **FA Posting Type** field, choose **Maintenance**.
6. Post the purchase invoice.

## Follow up on service visits

You can print the **Maintenance - Next Service** report to list the assets that are scheduled for service. You can also use this report when you want to update the **Next Service Date** field on fixed asset cards.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Maintenance Next Service**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields.  
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.


## Monitor maintenance costs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing fixed assets maintenance.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed asset maintenance, go to [Fixed assets maintenance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-maintenance-reports).

# Report selection for documents in Business Central

You can set up default reports to use to print sales, purchases, and service documents, such as orders, quotes, and invoices, and which layout is used. For example, if you have a specific layout for sales invoices, you can specify that report in the **Report Selections - Sales** page. You can then use the report when you send or print sales invoices.  

## Available report selections

The **Report Selections** pages specify the reports to print in different situations and the layout to use. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides default configurations, but you can change them if needed. You can also add reports to the **Report Selection** pages if you want to print more than one report per document type, for example.

The following table describes where you can find information about the different pages.  

|Area or task  |Learn more|
|--------------|----------|
|Example of how report selection works (sales)|[Report selection for sales documents](#example-report-selection-for-sales-documents)|
|Default layout for emails with sales and purchase documents  |[Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts for Sales and Purchase Documents](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts) |

|Define reports for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Germany)|[Set Up Reports for VAT and Intrastat](LocalFunctionality/Germany/how-to-set-up-reports-for-vat-and-intrastat.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can include additional **Report Selection** pages, depending on your location and industry, for example. To check your setup, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selection**, then choose the relevant link.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following **Report Selection** pages:

* **Report Selection - Sales**  
* **Report Selection - Project**  
* **Report Selection - Service**
* **Report Selection - Purchase**  
* **Report Selection - Cash Flow**  
* **Report Selection - Warehouse**  
* **Report Selection - Inventory**  
* **Report Selection - Bank Account**  
* **Report Selection - Production Order**  
* **Report Selection - Reminder/Finance Charge**  

## Example: Report selection for sales documents

The **Report Selection - Sales** page offers default reports to use in different scenarios for each related document type. Choose a document type in the **Usage** field, then add or review the report selection. You can set up more than one report and specify the sequence the reports must be sent or printed in.  

[!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can't send all document types as email attachments. For the document types you can, the **Report Selection** page contains extra fields.  

For example, on the **Report Selection - Sales** and **Report Selection - Purchase** pages, the following fields help you set up email:

|Field name |Description  |
|-----------|-------------|
|**Use for Email Body**| Insert summarized information, such as the invoice number, due date, or a link to a payment service in an email.|
|**Use for Email Attachment**| Attach the related document to the email.|
|**Email Body Layout Description**|Specify the email body layout to use. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |
|**Report Layout**|Specify the layout to use for the report. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |

# Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|
|Posted documents|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|Posted direct transfer|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|
|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Development of Validated Localization apps

This article describes the requirements and guidelines for developing a Validated Localization app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is a Validated Localization app?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available [globally in 170+ markets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json). In some markets, Microsoft works with independent software vendor (ISV) partners to localize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through localization apps that we make available on [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For those regions, localizations can be available through preferred localization app program. Preferred localization apps program recognizes those apps, which are built according to Microsoft quality guidelines. ISV partners who comply with those program requirements and guidelines can benefit technically and commercially to serve their resellers and customers.  

In the following sections, you can find requirements and guidelines. You can reach out to the program team if you want to participate in this program and comply with the below requirements by contacting us through [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Validated Localization apps initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot program. The following requirements and benefits can change based upon the partner and customer feedback.  

Apps in the Validated Localization pilot program contain a set of functionalities addressing local regulatory requirements that fall within one of the categories in the following list.  

- **Regulatory requirements** - local functionality that helps businesses fulfill their legal requirements, such as tax reporting, local E-invoicing formats, local GAAP, and other regulatory requirements.
- **National standards requirement** – local functionality that addresses local standards, such as address formats, national banking formats, or local interpretations of global standards.
- **Local language** - local language in the localization app, but also for a base app if this language isn't currently on the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Local market needs or industry requirements should not be included in the preferred localization apps. If apps contain these functionalities, the apps can't be approved as Validated Localization apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Local functionality is beneficial to the productivity business processes in a country and thereby adds value to a business but isn't required from a regulatory perspective, such as specific banking and payment formats, expense reports, HR features, and payroll. Similar smaller or bigger, and nice-to-have features should be isolated into other apps. If apps contain these functionalities, they aren't approved as Validated Localization apps.

## Validated Localization app business requirements  

- The Validated Localization App provider complies with all requirements to be a CSP indirect provider.  
- The Validated Localization App provider brings to market a minimum of offerings across five countries/regions, which bundle Dynamics 365 Business Central with a Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider has a minimum of 10 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers with production environments, which are actively using the Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider submits a business plan on a yearly basis to the program v-team. The plan includes planned marketing and readiness activities to promote the bundled offering with the CSP Indirect Resellers in applicable countries/regions. Plan can be submitted at the start of each quarter to [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).  
- The Validated Localization Apps are available to all customers and partners who want to benefit from them.
- The Validated Localization App provider engages in recurring workstreams with Microsoft.
- The Validated Localization App provider must maintain its status as an Embedded Localization Partner.  
- The Validated Localization App provider agrees to continuously adhere to the business, functional, and technical requirements outlined on this page.

## Validated Localization app functional and technical requirements  

### Functionality requirements

In addition to the technical requirements for the preferred localization app, the minimum viable product scope for preferred localization app is:  

- Local Regulatory Features:  
  - Legal requirements.
  - Officially mandatory features.
  - Horizontal only features (not industry-specific).  
  - Applicable in most businesses.  
  - Within the following blueprint:
    - Areas of the most frequent legislative changes.
    - Already tracked as a localization in Microsoft localizations.
    - Feature references – seldom new.  
    - No vendor or bank specific formats, payroll, or similar.
    - No global features not built by Microsoft.
- Translations:
  - Translation of a localization app to local languages.
  - Translation of a base app to local languages if the language isn't already [supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  
  - Translation of the localization app's documentation to local languages.
- Even though they're both part of localization, we recommended that National Standard Features (local part) are built as separate apps from Local Regulatory Features.
- Demo data in the local language for the specific market.
- All features must be designed with a basic user interface. They're intended primarily for the SMB market.  
- Avoid building new features if the same or similar functionality is already in the base app. For example, electronic invoicing, audit exports, VAT features, data exchange, and others. Most of the functionality is common to all countries/regions, but there are local rules or business formats that are extensions of global frameworks or formats. Instead of building new features, extend existing ones.  
- Prepare setup guides (wizards) for areas that are complex to set up to help users enable, discover, and have good first experience using your localization app.  
- Partners must provide functional documentation for all aspects of their localization.  

### Technical requirements  

The following are requirements that you must meet before submitting the Validated Localization app as an extension for validation. This list doesn’t change the [technical validation list](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission) and only extends requirements from there.  

- Providers must build the Validated Localization app based on the W1 base app.  
- Providers must follow Microsoft lifecycle and support policies.   
- Mandatory test automation must cover a minimum 80% of code and all business processes that change with the Validated Localization app must be covered by test automation.  
- Providers must update and/or test its Validated Localization app before the official launch of new release (minimum with the RC before new release) to confirm there are no issues. 
- All objects in the Validated Localization app code must be in English.   
- The Validated Localization app providers must follow Microsoft policy for obsolete objects and breaking changes and best practices for deprecation of the AL Code.  
- The Validated Localization app providers should add new events if required by the market (other implementation partners or customers) if it makes reasonable business sense. The events must follow Microsoft policy and practice. Otherwise, the validated localization app providers must provide a response to justify why it doesn't make reasonable business sense to add them.
- The Validated Localization app providers must provide written test scenarios in English and enable Microsoft to do manual testing if required by Microsoft.  
- If a Validated Localization app extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data model with new tables and/or fields, the Validated Localization app provider must set the **DataClassification** property correctly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create an integration if you find it beneficial to have some functionality placed outside the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and instead connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using for example, APIs or web services.

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Correct or cancel unpaid sales invoices

You can correct or cancel an unpaid posted sales invoice, provided that it hasn't been fully shipped. This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change before the shipment is complete. In all other scenarios, we recommend that you create a corrective sales credit memo directly. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).  

> [!NOTE]  
> After a posted sales invoice has been partially or fully paid, you cannot correct or cancel it from the posted sales invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a sales credit memo to void the sale and reimburse the customer, optionally managed with a sales return order. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

The difference between canceling or correcting a posted sales invoice that isn't paid or shipped is described in the following table.

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cancel** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
| **Correct** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A new sales invoice with the same information is created, unless the posted sales order was posted from a sales order. In that case, we suggest you cancel the posted sales invoice instead and then make the correction and continue the sales process from the original sales order. <br/><br/>The new sales invoice has a different number than the initial sales invoice. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
|**Create Corrective Credit Memo**|A new sales credit memo is created with the same information. You can adjust the new sales credit memo before posting, and it will be applied to the original invoice when you post it. |

When you correct or cancel a posted sales invoice, the corrective sales credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial sales invoice was posted. This reverses the posted sales invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted sales credit memo for your audit trail.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well. For more information, see [Correct Prepayments](finance-how-to-correct-prepayments.md).

## To cancel a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted sales invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Cancel** action.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating sales order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Qty. Invoiced** fields on the related sales order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

## To correct a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to correct.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, you can't correct the posted sales invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Correct** action.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the sales invoice was posted from a sales order, we recommend that you *cancel* this sales invoice and then process the correction from the original sales order. If the original sales order has been deleted, such as if it has been fully shipped, you can create a new sales order by using the **Copy Document** action. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-by-copying-a-posted-sales-invoice).
4. A new sales invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice.
5. Choose the **Show Corrective Credit Memo** action to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

# Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and see what is happening on the back end. By integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can give your sales people that insight. The integration lets people view information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. For more information, see [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the process of integrating the online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For information about on-premises configuration, see [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

## Integrate through Dataverse

To make it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you're integrating for the first time, you must do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.md).

## Integration settings that are specific to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration

Integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] happens through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and many standard settings and tables are provided. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following sections list those settings.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in Sales

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed, you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. The following security roles are deployed:

* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> * You must have Read permissions for the Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_connection) table.
> * You must have Read, Write, and Delete permissions for the Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_defaultconnection) table.

<!--
### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through Dataverse requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
### Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders

When you set up your integration, there are options that control the direction in which you synchronize sales orders, and how you submit them.

The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option lets you synchronize sales orders from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. For example, if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can archive the sales document and create a new document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same is true for changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when prices, tax amounts, or expected shipment dates change, the changes synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Bidirectional synchronization helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of sales orders.

For bidirectional synchronization, you make sales orders available for synchronization when you change their status to **Submitted** in Sales. When you set that status, you can no longer change information on the order's lines. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**. If there's a mistake, you can revert the order to **Open** (in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) or **Active** (in Sales), and then add or delete lines to correct the mistake, and submit the order again.

> [!TIP]
> When you enable the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a record on the **Sales Order Archives** page when you post or change information on an order. For example, the archived versions can be useful for exploring an order's history.

The **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option synchronizes only from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For this option, you use the **Submit** action in Sales to make orders available for synchronization. When you do, you can no longer change any information on the order. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**.

To use this option, you must provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, see [Handle Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** and **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** options are mutually exclusive. You can't use both options at the same time.

For both options, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows all sales orders with the **Submitted** status on the **Orders - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** page.

### Standard Sales entity mapping for synchronization

Entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as sales orders. To work with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|--|--|--|--|
| Unit of Measure | Unit Group | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] |  |
| Item | Product | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | Sales contact filter: **Product Type** is **Sales Inventory** |

> [!NOTE]
> The mappings for the Item Unit of Measure, Resource Unit of Measure, and Unit Group tables are available only if your administrator has turned on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Items and Resources with Products in Different Units of Measure](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronize-items-and-resources-with-products-with-different-units-of-measure).

## Synchronize items and resources with products with different units of measure

Businesses often produce or purchase the items in one unit of measure, and then sell them in another. To synchronize items that use multiple units of measure, you must turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. 

When you turn on the feature update, a new Unit Group table is created and assigned to each item and resource in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tables let you map the Unit Group, Item Unit of Measure, and Resource Unit of Measure tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the Dynamics 365 Sales Unit Group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following image shows the mappings.

:::image type="content" source="media/unit group 1.png" alt-text="Table mappings for unit groups":::

You can create multiple units of measure for each unit group, and assign the groups to products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize the products with items and resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually couple item units of measure or resource units of measure with a unit group. When you do, if the unit group for the item or resource isn't coupled to a unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example, because the unit group didn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

### Map items and resources to products

When you turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, the following happens:

* New mappings are created for items and resources.
* Existing mappings are deleted. <!--which mappings?-->
* A data upgrade creates unit groups for items and resources.

To use the new mappings, you must synchronize unit groups, item unit of measure, and resource unit of measures. You must also resynchronize items and resources. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] does not allow you to change a unit group for a product. Therefore, you must retire your products and uncouple the items and resources, and then synchronize by creating new products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. 

The following steps describe the steps to start mapping unit groups:

1. Be sure that products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] aren't coupled with items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they are, go to the **Items** and/or **Resources** pages and use the filter options to select the coupled records. Then choose the **Dynamics 365 Sales** action, and select **Uncouple**. This action schedules a background job to uncouple the records. While the job is running, you can check its status by using the **Synchronization Log** action. For more information, see [Coupling and Synchronizing](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md). 
2. Because new products are created in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with new unit groups, to avoid duplicate names, do one of the following steps:

  * Rename your products, and then retire them in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Retire products (Sales Hub)](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/retire-product). To bulk edit your products in Microsoft Excel, sign in to Power Apps, choose your environment, go to the **Product** table, and then choose the **Data** tab. Clear any filters that are applied. In the **Data** group, choose the **Edit Data in Excel** action. Add a prefix or suffix to the coupled products, and then retire them.
    * Retire your products and delete them. 

3. Follow these steps to synchronize **Unit Groups**, **Unit of Measures**, **Items**, and **Resources**:
    1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page.
    2. Use the **Run Full Synchronization** action to open the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.
    3. For the **ITEM UOM**, **RESOURCE UOM**, AND **UNIT GROUP** mappings, choose the **Recommend Full Synchronization** action.
    4. Choose the **Sync All** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For mappings that have not yet been fully synchronized, this action will fully synchronize them. To prevent those mappings from synchronizing, delete the mappings from the page. This only removes them from the current full synchronization, and does not delete the mappings.
    
5. Choose the **ITEM-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the items in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the item.
6. Choose the **RESOURCE-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the resources in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the resources.

### Synchronization rules

The following table lists the rules that control the synchronization between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These rules are in addition to rules defined for Dataverse, which also apply. For more information, see [Standard Entity Mapping](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to data in  that were made by the integration user account are not synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you do not change data while using that account. For more information, see [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

|Table|Rule|
|-----|----|
|Units of Measure|Units of measure are synchronized with unit groups in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. There can only be one unit of measure defined in the unit group.|
|Items|When it synchronizes items with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a price list in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To avoid synchronization errors, you shouldn't modify this price list manually.|
|Resources|Resources are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products that have product type Service.|
|Customer Price Groups|Customer price groups are synchronized with Sales price lists.|
|Sales Prices|Sales prices that have sales type Customer Price Group and have a sales code defined are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] price list lines|
|Opportunities|Opportunities are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] opportunities. The Salesperson Code value defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|Posted Sales Invoices|Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it's better to synchronize all other tables that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled table in Sales.|
|Sales Orders|When you enable sales order integration, when you release sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that were created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] they synchronize with sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all tables involved with the order. For example, sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

### Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration

The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. There are more jobs available from Dataverse. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](./admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. UNITOFMEASURE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
2. RESOURCE-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
3. ITEM-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
4. CUSTPRCGRP-PRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
5. SALESPRC-PRODPRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
6. POSTEDSALESINV-INV - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.

## Connect to on-premises versions of Business Central 2019 release wave 1 and Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

The Microsoft Power Platform team [announced](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse) that it's deprecating the Office 365 authentication type. If you're using a version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises that's earlier than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 1, you must use the OAuth authentication type to connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] online. The steps in this section describe how to connect the following product versions:

* Business Central 2019 release wave 1
* Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018

### Prerequisites

* You must have a Microsoft Azure subscription. A trial account works for application registration.
* [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is configured to use one of the following authentication types:

   * Office 365 (legacy)

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Effective April 2022, Office365 (legacy) will no longer be supported. For more information, see [Important changes (deprecations) coming in Power Apps, Power Automate and customer engagement apps](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse).

### Connect Business Central 2019 release wave 1 and Dynamics NAV 2018

1. Import the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Solution into your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment. The integration solution is available in the CrmCustomization folder on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Dynamics NAV 2018 installation DVD. Depending on your product version, import one of the following solutions:

   * For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the folder contains the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v9 and DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v91. solutions. The solution you should import depends on the version of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] you're connecting to. [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] online requires the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v91 integration solution.
   * For Dynamics NAV 2018, install the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution solution.

2. Create a non-interactive integration user in your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment, and assign the user the following security roles. For more information, see [Create a non-interactive user account](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-non-interactive-user-account).

   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

   > [!Important]
   > This user must not have the System Administrator security role. Also, you cannot use the system administrator account as the integration user.

3. In the Azure portal, create an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory). 
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you register the app in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment so that you do not have to consent to letting the app access the environment. If you register the app in another environment, you must sign in to Microsoft Entra ID using the administrator account for your Dataverse environment and give consent.
   >

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

# Import business data from other finance systems

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload your own data and to test your new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. Depending on the finance solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.  

From the Role Center, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can migrate data from QuickBooks because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to migrate data from other finance solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes templates for accounts, customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you import your data. To import item pictures, you can use a dedicated function on the **Inventory Setup** page. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you use data migration wizards to import data from Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, or QuickBooks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content, or [QuickBooks Data Migration](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md).

## Work with Data in Excel

You can use the Excel add-in to prepare existing content for use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

## Import Data from Configuration Packages

For larger implementation work, you can set up solution-specific configuration packages. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Working with configuration packages is advanced functionality, and we recommend that you contact your reselling partner. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only).

You can import master data and some transactional data from other finance systems based on the default configuration package in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Configuration Packages** page, you can work with the package to import and validate the data before you apply the package. For example, you can export the configuration package to Excel and set up your data there. Then, you can import the data from Excel again. The package consists of 27 tables, including master data such as customers, vendors, items, and accounts, other basic setup tables such as shipping methods, and transactions tables such as sales header and lines.  

When you export the default configuration package to Excel, the generated workbook contains a worksheet for each table in the package. To simplify your tasks, you can take advantage of the XML manipulation tools that are built into Excel. You can also use Excel built-in functions to help with data formatting and to put data in the correct cell. For example, add a blank worksheet and copy the legacy data to it. Then make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data. After you have mapped all of the data, copy the range of data onto the table worksheet.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not change the columns in the worksheets. If they are moved, changed, or deleted, the worksheet cannot be imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Fields of type Blob cannot be exported/imported using Excel.

### Tables in the Default Configuration Package

The default configuration package supports the following tables:

- Payment Terms
- Customer Price Group
- Shipment Method
- Salesperson/Purchaser
- Location
- GL Account
- Customer
- Vendor
- Item
- Sales Header
- Sales Line
- Purchase Header
- Purchase Line
- Gen. Journal Line
- Item Journal Line
- Customer Posting Group
- Vendor Posting Group
- Inventory Posting Group
- Unit of Measure
- Gen. Business Posting Group
- Gen. Product Posting Group
- General Posting Setup
- Territory
- Item Category
- Sales Price
- Purchase Price

# Flows for production, assembly, and projects

Internal flows, such as picking components and putting away end items for assembly, projects, and production orders are similar to inbound or outbound flows. Many of the processes might seem familiar. This article provides information about how to work with internal warehouse flows with various levels of complexity.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important that the options you choose improve your processes without causing overhead. The following tables describe typical configurations for dealing with physical goods for production, projects, and assembly orders.

### Inbound flow (put-away)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Inbound Flow of Production Order|Inbound Flow of Assembly Order|Inbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Output Journal</br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post output using **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|  
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Production Output Whse Handling: Inventory Put-away. </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can still post output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings. |Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order -> Inventory Put-away|Assembly Order|Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Consolidated put-away activities for multiple source documents.|No dedicated settings|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order(s) -> Output Journal|Assembly order(s) ->  internal movements | Put-away isn't applicable for projects|
|Advanced|Same as above plus directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above|Same as above| Put-away isn't applicable for projects|

Some configurations don't let you use dedicated warehouse documents to register put-aways. However, if your location uses bins you can use generic movement documents to move produced or assembled items to warehouse. Learn more at [Moving Items](warehouse-move-items.md).

### Outbound flow (pick)

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Outbound Flow of Production Order|Outbound Flow of Assembly Order|Outbound Flow of Projects|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Journal -> Consumption Journal </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can post consumption using a **Production Journal**.|Assembly Order|Project -> Project Journal|  
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Production, Assembly, Projects: Inventory Pick, Inventory Movement </br><br/> **NOTE**: You can still post consumption directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings.|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Production Order -> Inventory Pick|Assembly Order -> Inventory movement</br><br/>The **Inventory Movement** can be used only with bins.|Project -> Inventory Pick|
|Advanced|Consolidated pick activities for multiple source documents.|Production, Assembly, Projects: Warehouse Pick|Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Production Order(s) -> Warehouse Pick -> Consumption Journal |Assembly order(s) -> Warehouse Pick| Project(s) -> Warehouse Pick -> Project Journal |
|Advanced|Same as above + Directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above|Same as above| Same as above|

## Warehouses without dedicated warehouse activity

Even if you don't use dedicated warehouse activities, you might want to track things like consumption and production output. The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents.

* [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
* [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
* [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Basic warehouse configuration

### Flows to and from production in a basic warehouse configuration  

The inbound and outbound flows in a basic warehouse configuration involve the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the inbound flow (put-away), in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick/Movement**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick production components in the flow to production. To put away the products you produce, use **Inventory Put-away** documents.

For locations that use bins, inventory movement documents are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from To-Production or Open Shop Floor bins, go to [Flushing production components in the warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Inventory movements are important documents if you're using **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods. Learn more at [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

* The **To-Production Bin Code**, **From-Production Bin Code**, and **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** fields on the location or the machine/work center define the default flows to and from production areas.
* Manage the movement of produced items on the **Internal Movement** page without a relation to a production order.

### Flows to and from assembly in a basic warehouse configuration  

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Movement**.

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to pick assembly components in the flow to assembly. Post assembly output and consumption directly from an assembly order.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Pick** and **Inventory Put-away** documents aren't supported for assembly orders.

For locations that use bins:

* Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.
* The **To-Assembly Bin Code**, **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card define default flows to and from assembly areas.
* Manage the movement of assembled items on the **Internal Movement** page, without a relation to an assembly order.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order assembly flows. Learn more at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#understanding-assemble-to-order-and-assemble-to-stock). In relation to warehouse management, assemble-to-stock is part of the internal warehouse flow, and assemble-to-order is in the outbound warehouse flow. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Flows for project management in a basic warehouse configuration

The outbound flow in a basic warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Pick**.

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For a location that uses bins, the **To-Project Bin Code** field on the location defines the default flows to project management.

## Advanced warehouse configurations  

### Flows to and from production in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

Use the **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components for production.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warehouse Put-away** documents aren't supported for production output.

For locations that use bins:

* **Warehouse Movement** documents and the **Movement Worksheet** page are especially useful for component flushing. Learn more at [Flushing production components in the warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md#flushing-production-components-in-an-advanced-warehouse-configuration).
* The **To-Production Bin Code**, **From-Production Bin Code**, and **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** fields on the location or machine/work center define the default flows to and from production areas. 
* Manage the movement of produced items on the **Movement Worksheet** or **Whse. Internal Put-away** pages, without a relation to a production order.

### Flows to and from assembly in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**. 

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components for assembly.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warehouse Put-away** document isn't supported for assembly orders.

For locations that use bins:

* The **To-Assembly Bin Code** and **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location define the default flows to and from assembly areas.
* Manage the movement of assembly items on the **Movement Worksheet** or **Whse. Internal Put-away** pages, without a relation to an assembly order.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order assembly flows. Learn more at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#understanding-assemble-to-order-and-assemble-to-stock). 

Assemble-to-stock is part of the internal warehouse flow, and assemble-to-order is in the outbound warehouse flow. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).

### Flows to project management in advanced warehouse configurations

The outbound flow in an advanced warehouse configuration involves the following settings on the **Location Card** page for the location:

* For the outbound flow (pick), in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents and the **Pick Worksheet** page to pick components in the flow to project management.

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# Design details: Non-deductible VAT

Non-deductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser, but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, you must contact the local tax authorities in your country or region to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible. Even when you know that a specific percentage of the VAT isn't deductible, there are different models for handling non-deductible amounts as they are related to **items** and **fixed assets**.

## Prerequisites for using non-deductible VAT

To use and post non-deductible VAT, follow these steps.

1. On the **VAT Setup** page, select **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to enable the feature.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select which VAT posting groups can use non-deductible VAT.

## Examples

For the following examples, non-deductible VAT is enabled, and the following setup is completed:

- The **VAT Product Posting Group** field is set to **NDVAT**.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup** page:

    - **NDVAT** is set as the VAT product posting group, and **DOMESTIC** is set as the VAT business posting group.
    - The **VAT Identifier** value must be unique.
    - The **VAT %** field is set to **25**.
    - The **Allow Non-deductible VAT** field is set to **Allow**.
    - The **Non-deductible VAT %** field is set to **100**.
    - The **VAT Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**.
    - Only the sales VAT account and purchase VAT account are configured.

All the examples use items and fixed assets where the VAT product posting group is **NDVAT**.

### Items

A new item has **NDVAT** set as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Value Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Item Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Item Cost isn't enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,000.00 | 1 |

#### Use for Item Cost is enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,250.00 | 1 |

### Fixed assets

A new fixed asset has the acquisition cost account set to use **NDVAT** as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Fixed Asset Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost isn't enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost is enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 250.00 | 0.00 |
