# Power BI Sales app semantic model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The semantic model in the Power BI sales app is organized in a [Star Schema Model](/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview).

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices, and posted credit memos from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The dimension tables provide more context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.

## Fact tables

Fact tables store transactional data and support summarizations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and more. There are two fact tables in the Power BI Sales app:

- [Sales](#sales)
- [Sales Budget](#sales-budget)

### Sales

The app uses data from the following tables:

- Value Entries
- Sales Lines

Sales lines are broken down into **Shipped Not Invoiced** and **Outstanding Sales Lines**. Use the **Source Type** field to filter on these sources.

#### Table Definition

| Power BI field name | Business Central field name | Description |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| Date | Order Date / Posting Date | The **Order Date** is used for data from sales lines. The **Posting Date** is used for data from value entries. |
| Document No. |  Document No. | Specifies the document number. |
| Document Type |  Document Type | Specifies the document type. |
| Entry No. |  Entry No. / Sales Line No. | When reporting on value entries, this is the value entry number. When reporting on sales lines, this is the sales line number. |
| Entry Type |  Entry Type | When reporting on value entries, this is the entry type of the value entry. When reporting on sales lines, the value reads **Sales Line**. |
| Source Type |  - | Defines the source table of the record. |

# Couple and synchronize records between Dataverse and Business Central

This article describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator creates a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

<!--## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376] -->

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account or Contact pages.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple records automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. To learn more, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. To learn more, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have many Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

Use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel.
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.

# Set Up Document Sending Profiles
You can set each customer up with a preferred method of sending sales documents, so that you do not have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action.

On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you set up different sending profiles that you can select from in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** check box to specify that the document sending profile is the default profile for all customers, except for customers where the **Document Sending Profile** field is filled with another sending profile.

When you choose the **Post and Send** action on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box shows the sending profile used, either the one set up for the customer or the default for all customers. In the dialog box, you can change the sending profile for the sales document. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

# Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

## Use G/L account categories

You create the first layer of a financial report by selecting an account category for each general ledger account. There are six categories:

* Assets
* Liabilities
* Equity
* Income
* Cost of Goods
* Expense

You specify categories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the major sections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports.  

:::image type="content" source="media/account categories financial reporting.png" alt-text="Shows the G/L account categories page.":::

## Use account subcategories

You can also create subcategories for each account. Subcategories help add more details to the mapping for accounts in each category. You also specify subcategories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the subsections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports. Subcategories are more flexible than categories because you can define them. 

:::image type="content" source="media/account subcategories.png" alt-text="Shows account subcategories."::: 

## Map general ledger accounts

The most important feature of the financial reports that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides is the mapping between G/L accounts and account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page. All accounts in the chart of accounts should be listed in a selected category and subcategory, so when you generate financial reports you include all mapped accounts. To learn more about mapping categories, go to the examples in [Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports](bi-examples-custom-financial-reports.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/account mapping.png" alt-text="Shows accounts mapped to G/L account categories.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the mapping only in the United States. If you're using another country version, you must create the mapping yourself. The mapping will become available in more country versions in future releases.

## Generate financial reports

After you set up categories and subcategories have and map all accounts on the chart of accounts, choose **Generate Financial Reports**. This action updates financial reports with the M- prefix with the mapping provided for your chart of accounts.  

To control which reports update when you generate financial reports, update the fields in the **Reporting** section of the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

You can remap and update these reports at any time. If you choose to regenerate them, you can choose to keep the original reports and create copies with the new mapping.

## Audit changes to account categories

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L account categories. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L account categories and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account Category | 570 |

# Use Allocation Keys in General Journals
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by quantity, percentage, or amount.

## To set up allocation keys
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you are done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you are allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that has already been set up

# Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview

Small and mid-sized companies rely on built-in analytics and reporting capabilities they can use out-of-the-box to help keep track of their business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides reports and analytics tools that cover basic and complex business processes.

## Analytics needs in organizations

When you think about analytics in your organization, it might help to use a persona-based model to outline different needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

The model is based on the fact that different roles in an organization have different needs when it comes to data. The higher a role is placed in the organizational chart, the more aggregated data someone in the role needs to do their work.

Roles often have preferred ways to consume and analyze data, ways that reflect the level of data aggregation they need.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

Use the following sections to learn more about ways to consume data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Financial Reports
- KPIs and dashboards
- Power BI apps
- Ad-hoc analysis
- Reports

## Using Financial Reports to produce financial statements and KPIs

The Financial Reports feature gives you insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of a financial report." lightbox="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg":::

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics. For example, groups of customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Groups make it easier to retrieve data for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial statements and KPIs, go to [Using Financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs](bi.md).

## Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way to measure whether you’re delivering on your objectives.

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know whether your business is on the right path, or whether you should change course. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.

## Ad-hoc data analysis

You might just want to check whether the numbers add up correctly, quickly confirm or debunk a hypothesis about the business, or maybe look for anomalies in your financial data. For ad-hoc analyses, you might not have a built-in report that helps answer your questions. For ad-hoc analyses, use these two features:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as the General Ledger Entries or Customer Ledger Entries pages, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit. 

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png":::

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

To learn more about ad-how analyses, go to [Ad hoc data analysis](reports-adhoc-analysis.md).

## Reports

A report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gathers information based on a specified set of criteria. Reports organize and present the information in an easy-to-read format you can use in Excel, print, or save as a file.  

As an example of an interactive report in Excel, the **Aged Accounts Receivable** report lets you analyze what your customers owe you and when payments are due.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png" alt-text="Example of the interactive aged accounts receivables report in Excel." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png":::

For aged accounts receivables, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also includes a report designed for print. The ability to print is handy if you prefer to have the data in a .pdf file.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png" alt-text="Example of the  aged accounts receivables report in pdf." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png":::

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with more than 300 built-in reports that you can use to support your business processes with data-driven insights. To get a quick overview of all the reports that are available for your role, you can open the report explorer from the role center and all list pages and from **Tell Me**.

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-finance.png" alt-text="Example of how the report explorer shows all reports for a role." lightbox="media/report-explorer-finance.png":::

# Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the regional SEPA standards (Single Euro Payments Area) for importing SEPA bank statements (CAMT format). For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).  

 The SEPA CAMT standard itself has local variations. Therefore, you may have to modify the generic data exchange definition (represented by the **SEPA CAMT** code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page) to adapt it to a local variation of the standard. The following tables show the element-to-field mapping for tables 81, 273, and 274 in the SEPA CAMT implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

 For information about creating or adjusting a data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

## CAMT data mapping to fields in the General Journal table (81)  

|Element Path|Message Element|Data Type|Description|Negative-Sign Identifier|Field No.|Field Name|

 Elements in the **Ntry** node that are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but not mapped to any fields are stored in the **Posting Exch. Column Def** table. Users can view these elements from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, **Payment Application**, and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages by choosing the **Bank Statement Line Details** action. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In an import of CAMT bank statements, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] expects each transaction to be unique, which means that the **Transaction ID** field that comes from the *Stmt/Ntry/NtryDtls/TxDtls/Refs/EndToEndId* tag in the CAMT file, must be unique within the open bank account reconciliation. If the information is not present, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the payment. If an earlier bank reconciliation on the same bank account was posted with the same transaction ID as on the current import, the current transaction will not automatically reconcile but can still be imported.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Review amounts in general ledger accounts

You might have general ledger accounts that you frequently keep an eye on. Or you might want to speed up the review process at the end of the month. For help with keeping track of what you've done, and to speed up reviews, use the **Review Entries** action on the **Chart of Accounts** or the **G/L Account Card** page for each account. 

## Set up accounts for reviews

On the **G/L Account Card** page for each account, specify how to allow reviews in the **Review Policy** field.

|Review Policy  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|None     | You can't mark entries for the account as reviewed. For example, use this option for accounts such as payables, receivables, and bank accounts where there are other ways to review their amounts.        |
|Allow Review     | You don't have to include entries in a review, and the amounts of the debit and credit entries don't have to balance. You remove a review, for example, if you've made a mistake.        |
|Allow Review and Match Balance     | The total amounts of the debit and credit entries in the review must match. The **Debit** and **Credit** fields show those amounts, and the **Balance** field shows the total. This setting also lets you remove a review. When you remove a review from one or more entries, the debit and credit entries must still balance.        |

## Mark entries as reviewed

Choose the entries you've reviewed, and then use the **Set selected as reviewed** action. Each time you mark one or more entries as reviewed the entries are given the same number in the **Reviewed Identifier** column. The review identifier is a handy way to keep track of the entries that were reviewed at the same time. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also records the user who did the review, and when they did it.

If you mark entries as reviewed, but regret doing so, use the **Set selected as not reviewed** action.

* If the Review allowed policy is assigned to the account, the action resets the reviewed identifier to 0 and removes the person and date and time of the review. 
* If the Review allowed and match balance policy is assigned, the credit and debit must still balance. For example, if one of the entries in a review is a mistake, you can choose another entry with the correct value. The replacement entry doesn't have to have the same reviewed identifier.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to choose multiple entries is to hold down Ctrl or Shift while you choose the entries. *Ctrl* lets you selects specific entries, and *Shift* selects all entries between the first and last entries you select.

## Review accounts that have old entries

You might have entries from past periods that you've already reviewed or just don't need a review. You just want to start reviewing entries from, for example, the beginning of the year or accounting period. You can leave the entries as is. However, if you want to analyze data in Excel or by using Analysis Mode, mark the entries as reviewed. To learn more about analyzing entries, go to [Analyze entries](#analyze-entries). To mark the entries as reviewed, add a filter on the Filter pane to display only those entries, and then choose the **Mark selected entries as reviewed** action.

## Filter entries

To get a clearer picture, there are several ways to filter entries on the **Review G/L Entries** page.

* Use the **Show Reviewed Entries** and **Hide Reviewed Entries** actions to show only the entries you have or haven't reviewed. To clear the filters, use the **Show all entries** action.
* Use the Filter pane. For example, you might filter by account number or, if you have older entries and want to mark them all as reviewed, by a posting date.

## Analyze entries

There are a couple of ways to analyze the general ledger entries you've reviewed.

* Turn on Analysis Mode, for example, to group entries according to their reviewed identifier. To learn more about Analysis Mode, go to [Analyze List Page Data Using Analysis Mode](analysis-mode.md).
* Export the entries to Excel.

# Work with dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts. Learn more at [Business Intelligence](bi.md).

Another example is to set up a dimension called *Department*, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items. The more dimensions you use, the more detailed are the reports you base your business decisions on. In fact, a single sales entry can include information from multiple dimensions, such as:  

* The account the item sale was posted to.  
* Where the item was sold.
* Who sold it.
* Which customer bought it.

## Analyze by dimensions

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence, such as when defining analysis views. Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

> [!TIP]
> A quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions is to use the **Set Dimension Filter** action to filter totals by dimensions in the chart of accounts and on pages for entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Analysis views often use data from dimensions. If you discover an incorrect dimension has been used on posted general ledger (G/L) entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. This helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate. Learn more at [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Dimension sets

A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. They're stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. In addition, each dimension set, and dimension set entry within it, is identified by a common dimension set ID.  

When you create a journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

## Set up dimensions

You can define dimensions and dimension values to categorize journals and documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders. You set up dimensions on the **Dimensions** page, where you create one line for each dimension, such as *Project*, *Department*, *Area*, and *Salesperson*.

You also set up values for dimensions. Let's say values represent your company's departments. Dimension values can be set up in a hierarchical structure similar to the chart of accounts. That means data can be broken down into various levels of granularity, and subsets of dimension values can be totaled. You can define as many dimensions and dimension values as you need, and everyone in your company can use them.

When dimensions and values are set up, you can define global and shortcut dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. These dimensions are then always available for you to select as fields on journal and document lines, and ledger entries, without opening the **Dimensions** page first. Learn more in the [To set up global and shortcut dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-global-and-shortcut-dimensions) section.

* **Global Dimensions** are used as filters, for example, on reports, batch jobs, and XMLports. You can use only two global dimensions, so choose dimensions you'll use often.
* **Shortcut Dimensions** are available as fields on journals, document lines, and ledger entries. You can create up to eight of these.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a new dimension in any entry, such as a line or new record, you cannot delete the dimension, even if you do not post the entry. This is because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately creates a dimension set for the line or record. Learn more in the [Dimension Sets](finance-dimensions.md#dimension-sets) section.

### To set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts

You can assign a default dimension for a specific account. The dimension is copied to the journal or document when you enter the account number on a line, but you can delete or change the code on the line if appropriate. You can also require a dimension for posting an entry in a specific type of account. > 

> [!NOTE]
> Default dimension priorities open up for scenarios in sales and purchases that you might want to pay special attention to. When you use default dimension priorities on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always considers the dimensions in the header as coming from the customer or vendor. This is true for dimensions that you set manually or by default, and is especially relevant when you use default dimensions on locations and items but not on customers or vendors.
>
> **Example**
>
> You have a scenario with the following dimension settings:
>
> * A customer without default dimensions
> * An item with ADM as the dimension value for the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * A location with PROD as the dimension value the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * Default dimension priorities are set as Customer > Item > Location
>
> When you create a new document in this scenario, dimensions are used as follows:
>
> * If you create a new document and add a location, the default value for new lines will be PROD. When you add lines with items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will keep PROD because it comes from the header of the document.
>
> * If you create a new document and add items that have the ADM dimension value, and then specify a location in the header of the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to overwrite the existing lines because there's a conflict.
>
> We recommend that you to test your default dimensions setup, dimension priorities, and the order in which you enter data in documents.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimensions**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimensions** page, select the relevant dimension, then choose the **Account Type Default Dim** action.  
3. Fill in a line for each new default dimension you want to set up. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you want to require a dimension but don't want to assign a default value to the dimension, leave the **Dimension Value Code** field blank, then select **Code Mandatory** in the **Value Posting** field.  

> [!WARNING]  
> If an account is used in an **Adjust Exchange Rates** or **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, do not select **Code Mandatory** or **Same Code**. These batch jobs cannot use dimension codes.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an account must have a different dimension than the default dimension assigned to the account type, you must set up a new default dimension for the account. The default dimension for the account then replaces the default dimension for the account type.  

### To set up default dimension priorities

Different account types, such as a customer account and an item account, can have different default dimensions. As a result, an entry might have more than one  proposed default dimension. To avoid such conflicts, you can apply priority rules to the different sources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Dimension Priorities**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, in the **Source Code** field, enter the source code for the entry table to which the default dimension priorities will apply.  
3. Fill in a line for each default dimension priority you want for the selected source code.
4. Repeat the procedure for each source code you want to set up default dimension priorities for.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you set up two tables with the same priority for the same source code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always selects the table with the lowest table ID.  

### To set up dimension combinations

To avoid posting entries with contradictory or irrelevant dimensions, you can block or limit specific combinations of two dimensions. A blocked dimension combination means you can't post both dimensions on the same entry regardless of what the dimension values are. In contrast, a limited dimension combination means you can post both dimensions to the same entry, but only for certain combinations of dimension values.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimension Combinations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimension Combinations** page, choose the dimension combination field you want from the following options.  

    |Field|Description|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No limitation**|This dimension combination has no restrictions. All dimensions values are allowed.|  
    |**Limited**|This dimension combination has restrictions depending on which dimension values that you enter. You must define the limitations on the **Dimension Value Combination** page.|  
    |**Blocked**|This dimension combination isn't allowed.|  

3. If you selected the **Limited** option, you must define which combinations of dimension values are blocked. To do this, choose the field to define the dimension value combination.  
4. Now select a dimension value combination that is blocked and enter **Blocked** in the field. A blank field means the dimension value combination is allowed. Repeat if multiple combinations are blocked.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The same dimensions are displayed in both rows and columns, meaning all dimension combinations appear two times. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically displays the setting in both fields. You cannot select anything in the fields from the upper-left corner and down, because those fields have the same dimension in both rows and columns.  
>

### To set up global and shortcut dimensions

Global and shortcut dimensions can be used as filters in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], including on reports, batch jobs, ledger entry pages, and analysis views. Global and shortcut dimensions can be inserted directly without first opening the **Dimensions** page. On journal and document lines, you can select global and shortcut dimensions in a field on the line. You can set up two global dimensions and eight shortcut dimensions. Choose the dimensions that you use most frequently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a global or shortcut dimension requires all entries posted with the dimension be updated. To change a global dimension, you can use the **Change Global Dimensions** function, but that can be time-consuming, may affect performance, and tables may be locked during the update. Make sure you choose your global and shortcut dimensions carefully so you won't have to change them later. To change a shortcut dimension, use the **Change Dimensions** action.
>
> Learn more in the [To change global dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-change-global-dimensions) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add or change a global or shortcut dimension, you are automatically signed out and back in so the new value is prepared for use.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### To change global dimensions

When you change a global or shortcut dimension, all entries posted with that dimension are updated. Because this process may be time-consuming and can affect performance, two different modes are provided to adapt the process to the size of the database.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Change Global Dimensions** action.
3. At the top of the page, select one of the following two modes for running the batch job.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |**Sequential**|(Default) The change is done in one transaction that reverts all entries to the dimensions they had before the change.<br /><br />This option is recommended if the company has relatively few posted entries, in which case the batch job takes the shortest time to complete. The process locks multiple tables and blocks other users until it's done. Note that with large databases, the process might not complete in this mode. In that case, use the **Parallel** option.|
    |**Parallel**|The dimension change happens in multiple background sessions and the operation is split into multiple transactions. To use this option, turn on the **Parallel Processing** toggle. <br /><br />We recommended this option for large databases or companies with numerous posted entries because it will complete in the shortest time. Note that in this mode, the update process won't start if there's more than one active database session.|  

4. In the **Global Dimension 1 Code** and/or **Global Dimension 2 Code** fields, enter the new dimension(s). The current dimensions are displayed in gray behind the fields.
5. Depending on the mode, do one of the following:
    * In **Sequential** mode, choose the **Start** action.
    * In **Parallel** mode, choose the **Prepare** action.

    The **Log Entries** tab is filled with information about the dimensions to be changed.
6. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then sign in again.
7. Choose the **Start** action to begin the parallel processing of the dimension changes.

### Example of dimension setup

Let's say your company wants to track transactions based on organizational structure and geographic locations. To do that, you set up two dimensions on the **Dimensions** page:

* **AREA**  
* **DEPARTMENT**  

| Code | Name | Code Caption | Filter Caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AREA |Area |Area Code |Area Filter |
| DEPARTMENT |Department |Department Code |Department Filter |

For **AREA**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 |Americas |Begin-Total |
| 20 |North America |Standard |
| 30 |Pacific |Standard |
| 40 |South America |Standard |
| 50 |Americas, Total |End-Total |
| 60 |Europe |Begin-Total |
| 70 |EU |Standard |
| 80 |Non-EU |Standard |
| 90 |Europe, Total |End-Total |

For the two main geographic areas, Americas and Europe, you add subcategories for regions by indenting the dimension values. This lets you report on sales or expenses in regions, and get totals for the larger geographic areas. You could also choose to use countries, regions, counties, or cities as your dimension values, depending on your business.

> [!NOTE]  
> To set up a hierarchy, the codes must be in alphabetical order. This includes the codes of the dimension values provided in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For **DEPARTMENT**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADMIN |Administration |Standard |
| PROD |Production |Standard |
| SALES |Sales |Standard |

With this setup, you can add your two dimensions as the two global dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This means you can use AREA and DEPARTMENT as filters for general ledger entries, as well as on all reports. Both global dimensions are also automatically available for use on entry lines and document headers as shortcut dimensions.

## Getting an overview of dimensions used multiple times

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page specifies how a group of accounts uses dimensions and dimension values. You can set this up by highlighting multiple accounts, then specifying default dimensions and dimension values for them. After that, the application suggests these dimensions and dimension values whenever one of these accounts is used, such as on a journal line. This makes entry posting easier for the user, as the dimension fields are filled in automatically. Also note, however, that the dimension values suggested can be changed on, for example, a journal line.

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Dimension Code**|Shows all dimensions defined as default dimensions on one or more highlighted accounts. By choosing this field, you can see a list of all available dimensions. If you select a dimension, that dimension is defined as a default dimension for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Dimension Value Code**|Shows either a single dimension value or the term (Conflict). If a dimension value is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. Upon choosing the **Dimension Code** field, you'll see a list of all available dimension values for a dimension. If you select a dimension value, it will be defined as a default dimension value for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Value Posting**|Shows either a single value posting rule or the term (Conflict). If a value posting rule is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all the highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. Upon choosing the **Value Posting** field, you'll see a list of value posting rules for a dimension. If you select a value posting rule, it will be applied to all highlighted accounts.|

## Use dimensions

In a document such as a sales order, you can add dimension information for both an individual document line and the document itself. So on the **Sales Order** page, you could enter dimension values for the first two shortcut dimensions on the individual sales lines, then add more dimension information if you choose the **Dimensions** button.  

If you work in a journal instead, you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way, if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines.  

You can also set up default dimensions for accounts or account types, so dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically.

### To view global dimensions in ledger entry pages

Global dimensions are always company-defined and company-named. To see the global dimensions for your company, open the **General Ledger Setup** page.

In a ledger entry page, you can see whether there are global dimensions for the entries. The two global dimensions differ from your other dimensions because you can use them as filters anywhere in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**,  then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. To see only entries that are relevant, set one or more filters on the page.  
4. To see all the dimensions for an entry, select the entry, then choose the **Dimensions** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page displays the dimensions one ledger entry at a time. You'll see as you scroll through the ledger entries, the content on the **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page changes accordingly.

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**No. of Outstanding Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-outstanding-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Received Not Invd. Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-received-not-invd-purchase-orders)

# Copilot data movement across geographies

Although Copilot in Business Central is available in all geographic areas where Business Central online is available, it requires Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is available only in specific regions.  

Depending on where your environment is hosted, you might need to allow data to move outside of your primary data residency to an Azure OpenAI endpoint located in another geography. You provide consent in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If you don't provide consent, Copilot won't be available to your organization. Learn how to provide consent in [Allow data movement across geographies](enable-ai.md#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

Individual Copilot features might not be available in all geographies. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external). Copilot and generative AI features from non-Microsoft publishers, such as those originating from customizations or AppSource apps you install, each define their own specific Azure OpenAI Service regions. Consult with the extension publisher to understand which regional Azure services are used by the extension.

## How data movement across geographies works

When you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any personal data, might move outside of your geography to the location where the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint is hosted. We might store prompt and output data for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but we don't look at it unless our automated systems flag it for review. We don't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models. Learn more at [Abuse Monitoring](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Business Central environment is hosted in the EU Data Boundary, we use an Azure OpenAI endpoint in the same boundary. Learn more: [EU Data Boundary countries and datacenter locations](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn#eu-data-boundary-countries-and-datacenter-locations)

The following table describes when and how data can move across geographies for Copilot in Business Central. 

| Azure&nbsp;region&nbsp;where&nbsp;your&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Central environment is hosted | Azure geography where Azure OpenAI Service is hosted |Consent required for data movement across geographies? |How to allow data to move across geographic areas|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Allow data movement** toggle is on by default from update 25.0. Administrators can opt out at any time, even before environments are upgraded. Environments upgrading to update 25.0 or later will have the **Allow data movement** toggle turned on by default from November 3, 2024, or from the date you have specified for the environment to be upgraded to update 25.0. New environments created after October 1, 2024, will have the **Allow data movement** toggle turned on.

## How to find the Azure region of a Business Central environment

To find the Azure region where a Business Central environment is hosted, sign in to the Business Central admin center, choose the environment to display details, and then find the **Azure Region** field.

# Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automated workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to recurring problems.

## Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

### Possible cause

Currently, there's a limit on how many records a flow can process. If more than 1000 records are created or changed within 30 seconds, the flow isn't triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. Learn more at [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions#notes-for-power-automate-flows) in the Developer and Admin help.

## "The response from the Business Central service is too large" error

### Problem

When using an action that interacts with records (such as *Create record (V3)* and *Get record (V3)*), Power Automate might display an error similar to this one:

`The response from the Business Central service is too large`

### Possible cause

Even though Business Central has no set limit on the size of records returned by APIs, the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector for Power Automate can handle only records up to 8 MB.

All the Business Central APIs provided by Microsoft return records under this limit, but APIs provided by partners might not. If you see an error "The response from the Business Central service is too large," reach out to the partner who created the API you're using.

## "Entity set not found" error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to this one:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate for approvals requires certain page and codeunit objects to be published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services. But in some cases, your environment might have been customized so these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

| Object Type | Object ID | Object Name | Service Name |
|--|--|--|--|
| Codeunit | 1544 | WorkflowWebhookSubscription | WorkflowActionResponse |
| Page | 6408 | workflowCustomers | workflowCustomers |

| Page | 6410 | workflowVendors | workflowVendors |
| Page | 831 | workflowWebhookSubscriptions | workflowWebhookSubscriptions |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.

All items should be planned for, however, there is no reason to calculate a plan for an item unless there has been a change in the demand or supply pattern since the last time a plan was calculated.  

If the user has entered a new sales order or changed an existing one, there is reason to recalculate the plan. Other reasons include a change in forecast or the desired safety stock quantity. Changing a bill of material by adding or removing a component would most likely indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

For multiple locations, the assignment takes place at the level of item per location combination. If, for example, a sales order has been created at only one location, application will assign the item at that specific location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If no change in an item’s demand-supply pattern has occurred, the planning system will not suggest any actions to be taken. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items in order to find out what to plan for, and that would drain system resources.  

The **Planning Assignment** table monitors demand and supply events and assigns the appropriate items for planning. The following events are monitored:  

* A new sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Change of item, quantity, location, variant, or date on a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Cancellation of a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Consumption of items other than planned.  
* Output of items other than planned.  
* Unplanned changes in inventory.  

For these direct supply-demand displacements, the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message.  

The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance:  

* Change of status to Certified in the production BOM header (for all items using that header).  
* Deleted line (child item).  
* Change of status to Certified in the routing header (for all items using that routing).  
* Changes in the following item card fields.  
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time.  
* Lead Time Calculation.  
* Reorder Point.  
* Production BOM No. (and all children of old BOM reference).  
* Routing No.  
* Reordering Policy.  

In these cases, a new function, Planning Assignment Management, maintains the table and states the planning reason as Net Change.  

The following changes do not cause a planning assignment:  

* Calendars  
* Other planning parameters on the item card  

When calculating an MPS or an MRP, the following restrictions apply:  

* MPS: The planning system checks that the item carries a demand forecast or a sales order. If not, the item is not included in the plan.  
* MRP: If the planning system detects that the item is being replenished by an MPS planning line or MPS supply order, the item will be left out of the planning. However, any demand from relevant components is included.

# Setting Up Manufacturing

To convert material into produced end items, production resources, such as bills of material, routings, machine operators, and machinery must be set up in the system.

Operators and machines are represented in the system as machine centers that may be organized in work centers and work center groups. When these resources are established, they can be loaded with operations according to the item's defined material (BOM) and process (routing) structure, and according to the capacity of the machine or work center. You can also set the production capacity of each resource. Capacity is defined by the work time available in the machine and work centers, and is governed by calendars for each level. A work center calendar specifies the working days or hours, shifts, holidays, and absence that determine the work center's gross available capacity (typically measured in minutes). All of this is determined by defined efficiency and capacity values.  

When you have set up manufacturing, you can plan and execute production orders. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md) and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Put items away with warehouse put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table, and assumes that receiving has already happened. Learn more at [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse put-away processing and warehouse receive processing, use warehouse put-away documents to control how items are put away. When you post a warehouse receipt, source documents such as purchase, inbound transfer, or sales return orders, are updated. The quantity received is posted to the item ledger, and the lines for the received items are sent to the put-away function in the warehouse.

Depending on the value in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field on the **Location card**, the lines are either made available to the put-away worksheet or used to generate put-away documents immediately. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In addition to the standard ways to create warehouse put-aways that this article describes, you can create put-aways from the related posted warehouse receipt. This is useful if you have deleted put-away lines, or if you decide not to use the put-away worksheet, because you can create or recreate put-away instructions from the posted receipt lines.

## Zone and bin codes

At locations that are set up to use directed put-away and pick, the following settings are required to determine the best place to put the items:  

* A put-away template is set up. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).  
* The weight, cubage, and special storage requirements of the item or stock-keeping unit are defined.
* The capacity, bin type, and bin ranking are defined for the bins.  

The bin ranking is used when more than one bin matches the criteria on the put-away template. If both the put-away template criteria and the bin ranking are the same for more than one bin, the bin with the highest number is selected.

## To create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet  

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

You can create put-away documents for multiple receipts at the same time on the **Put-away Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action. The **Put-away Selection** page opens.  

    The list contains all posted receipts that are ready to be put away, including those for which put-away instructions have already been created. Documents with put-away lines that have been completely put away and registered are not shown on this list.  
3. Select the documents that you want to work on. You can work on lines from several documents at the same time.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a receipt or internal put-away document for which you've already created instructions for all lines, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] informs you that there's nothing to handle.  

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the put-away instruction. However, the same opportunities for sorting and bin ranking exist. You can recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the put-away instructions or sort in the put-away instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  
6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can delete lines, for example, if some items need to be put away in a bin that's far away from the bins for the other items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you delete lines they're only deleted from this worksheet. They aren't deleted from the put-away selection.  

7. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. The **Create Document** page opens, where you can add more information to the put-away you're creating.  

    * You can assign the put-away to a specific employee.  
    * You can sort the put-away instruction lines as you did in the worksheet or by bin ranking. When you sort according to bin ranking, the *Take* lines appear first, because most receipt bins have a 0 bin ranking. The *Place* lines appear last, starting with the bins with the lowest bin ranking. If you have structured your warehouse so bins of similar bin ranking are side by side, sorting lines in this way will save steps for warehouse employees.  
    * You can choose not to include the lines that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created when it converted a large unit of measure to smaller units of measure by selecting the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field. Learn more about breakbulk at [Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-enable-automatic-breaking-bulk-with-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).  
    * You can choose not to have the **Qty. to Handle** field automatically filled in on the put-away instructions.  
    * You can choose to print the document immediately.  

8. Choose **OK** to create the put-away.  

## To create a put-away from a posted receipt

If a location uses both put-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put-away lines, or if you use directed put-away and pick and have decided not to use the put-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put-away instructions for the posted receipt lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a posted receipt to put away.  
3. Choose the **Card** action.  

    If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates whether the receipt is partially or completely put-away.  

4. If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, choose the **Create Put-away** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.  

## To put items away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.

2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If your warehouse requires, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    You can sort the put-away lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the actions.

    If a bin code is mandatory for the locations, each receipt line becomes at least two lines in the warehouse put-away, as follows.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.

# Suggest vendor payments

On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Based on your settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests lines for:

- Payments that are due soon.
- Payments where a payment discount is available.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must prioritize your vendors. To learn more about prioritizing vendors, go to [Prioritize Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** or that are already applied and have a value in the **Applies-to ID** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
>
> * Prioritized overdue vendor entries first, in order of priority.
> * Overdue vendor entries that aren't prioritized.  
> * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts. The entries are arranged by vendor number.  

## Use the Suggest Vendor Payments action

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open the journal, and then select the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Select the **OK** button.  

## Insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines

When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to ensure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc. Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarize per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts might not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date and a warning displays.  

You can also manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. To learn more about this manual process, go to [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date and the font on the line changes to red.

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liabilities report" lightbox="media/finance/liabilities-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

# Allocation Status and Repair Status of Service Items
The repair status of service items and the allocation status of the allocation entries for the service items have a certain relationship in Service Management. The allocation status changes when you change the repair status of the service item to **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** and when you convert a service quote to a service order. The repair status of the service item changes when you cancel the service item allocation or reallocate the service item to another resource. You can view the repair status of service items on the **Service Tasks** page and you can update the repair status in the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can view the allocation status in the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocations** page.  
  
## Changing Repair Status  
When you change the repair status of a service item on a service item line, there is a search for a corresponding allocation entry for this service item that has the status **Active**. If such an allocation entry is found, the status is updated in one of the following ways:  
  
* If you change the repair status to **Finished**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If you change the repair status to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some of the service has been completed, or **Referred**, that is, no service has been done, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
* When a service order allocation entry is created that indicates that no resource has been allocated, the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocation** page is set to **Nonactive**.  
* The allocation entry status is set to **Canceled** when you reallocate the referred service item in the service order allocation entry, which indicates that the allocated resource or resource group has not attempted the service task.  
  
The allocation status reflects when the service process is finished, or when another resource is necessary in order to finish the service of the service item.  
  
## Converting Service Quotes to Service Orders  
When you convert a service quote to a service order, the service order, the service items in the order and their allocation entries are updated in the following ways:  
  
* The repair status of the service items is changed to **Initial**.  
* The service order status is changed to **Pending**.  
* There is a search for allocation entries for all the service items in the service order that have the status **Active**. If such allocation entries are found, their allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
  
## Canceling Allocations  
When you cancel an allocation for a service item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the allocation status of the corresponding allocation entry from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.

The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
## Reallocating an Active Allocation Entry  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that is **Active**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Canceled**.  
  
The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the same way as if you had canceled the allocation:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
A new allocation entry that contains the new resource is created that has the status **Active**.  
  
## Reallocating a Service Item  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that has the status **Reallocation Needed**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.

# Setting up inventory

Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

After you set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Depreciate or amortize fixed assets

Depreciation is used to allocate the cost of fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, over their depreciable life. For each fixed asset, you must define how to depreciate it.  

 There are two ways to post depreciation:  

* Automatically, by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job.  
* Manually, by using the fixed asset G/L journal.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate daily depreciation, which allows you to calculate depreciation for any period. You can therefore analyze current operating results on, for example, a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The calculation uses a standard year of 360 days and a standard month of 30 days. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).  

If several departments use a fixed asset, periodic depreciation can be automatically allocated to these departments according to a user-defined allocation table.  

You can cancel incorrect depreciation entries by using the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. Afterward, you can post the correct amount by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job again. The errors you correct are posted as fixed asset error ledger entries.  

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. You can use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to recalculate the depreciation amounts.  

## To calculate depreciation automatically

Once a month, or whenever you choose, you can run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The batch job ignores fixed assets that were sold, are blocked or inactive, or use the manual depreciation method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **No. of Depreciation Days** field, you can see how many days of depreciation were calculated.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> Known limitation: If you set the **Use Force No. of Days** field to Yes, and the **Force No. of Days** field is set to a value where **Posting Date** minus **Number of Days** results in a date in the previous calendar year, the system will not let you post the depreciation.
> You can avoid it by reducing the **Force No. of Days** field to no more than than the calculated days until posting date using 30days/month OR set the flag **Fiscal Year 365 Days** in the Depreciation Book.
> We recommend the first option as you may not want to change the use of 30days/months for depreciation. For more information, see [Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#fiscal-year-365-days-field-depreciation).


## To post depreciation manually from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Depreciation**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for depreciation posting. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.  

The **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is updated accordingly.

If you set up fixed asset allocation keys to allocate amounts to different departments or projects, the amounts are allocated during posting. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).  

## To manage the ending book value

In the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page, you can specify the book value that you want your fixed asset to have in the current depreciation book after you fully depreciate it. You can enter the value manually, or you can fill in the **Default Ending Book Value** field on the related **Depreciation Book** page. The value automatically fills in the field.

> [!NOTE]
> If the last depreciation means that the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is zero, the last depreciation is automatically reduced by this amount.<br /><br />
> If the value in the **Book Value** field is greater than zero after the last depreciation,  for example because of a rounding problem or because a salvage value exists, the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is ignored. For more information, see [To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost](fa-how-acquire.md#to-post-the-salvage-value-together-with-the-acquisition-cost).

## To calculate allocations for a Fixed Asset


1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Related**, **Posting Group**, **Allocations** and then select **Depreciation**.
3. Fill in the G/L accounts and the corresponding allocation percentages for each posting group and then close the page.
4. Next, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
5. Enter the Fixed Asset and the corresponding FA Posting Group and Depreciation book will determine the allocation lines.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a fixed asset is used by several departments, you can select the dimension on the Fixed Asset G/L Journal line.

## Use duplication lists to prepare to post to multiple depreciation books

When you fill in journal lines to post to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal so you can post to a different depreciation book. For more information, see To [post entries to different depreciation books](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-post-entries-to-different-depreciation-books).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the depreciation book, and then select the **Part of Duplication List** check box.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you have selected the **Use Duplication List** field, do not use number series on the journal. The reason is that the number series for the fixed asset G/L journal does not the number series for the fixed asset journal.  

## To post entries to different depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the journal that you want to post depreciation with, select the **Use Duplication List** check box.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Fixed Asset Journal** page contains new lines for different depreciation books according to the duplication list.  
6. Review or edit the lines, and then choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Another way to duplicate an entry in a separate book is to enter a depreciation book code in the **Duplicate in Depreciation Book** field when you fill in a journal line.  

You can copy entries from one depreciation book to another by using the **Copy Depreciation Book** batch job. The batch job creates journal lines in the journal batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book that you want to copy to. To learn more, go to [To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books](#to-copy-fixed-asset-ledger-entries-between-depreciation-books).  

## To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant depreciation book card, and then choose the **Copy Depreciation Book** action.  
3. On the **Copy Depreciation Book** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The copied lines are created in either the fixed asset G/L journal or the fixed asset journal, depending on whether the depreciation book that you're copying has integration to the general ledger.

# Import business data from other finance systems

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload your own data and to test your new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. Depending on the finance solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.  

From the Role Center, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can migrate data from QuickBooks because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to migrate data from other finance solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes templates for accounts, customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you import your data. To import item pictures, you can use a dedicated function on the **Inventory Setup** page. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you use data migration wizards to import data from Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, or QuickBooks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content, or [QuickBooks Data Migration](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md).

## Work with Data in Excel

You can use the Excel add-in to prepare existing content for use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

## Import Data from Configuration Packages

For larger implementation work, you can set up solution-specific configuration packages. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Working with configuration packages is advanced functionality, and we recommend that you contact your reselling partner. For more information, see [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only).

You can import master data and some transactional data from other finance systems based on the default configuration package in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Configuration Packages** page, you can work with the package to import and validate the data before you apply the package. For example, you can export the configuration package to Excel and set up your data there. Then, you can import the data from Excel again. The package consists of 27 tables, including master data such as customers, vendors, items, and accounts, other basic setup tables such as shipping methods, and transactions tables such as sales header and lines.  

When you export the default configuration package to Excel, the generated workbook contains a worksheet for each table in the package. To simplify your tasks, you can take advantage of the XML manipulation tools that are built into Excel. You can also use Excel built-in functions to help with data formatting and to put data in the correct cell. For example, add a blank worksheet and copy the legacy data to it. Then make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data. After you have mapped all of the data, copy the range of data onto the table worksheet.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not change the columns in the worksheets. If they are moved, changed, or deleted, the worksheet cannot be imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Fields of type Blob cannot be exported/imported using Excel.

### Tables in the Default Configuration Package

The default configuration package supports the following tables:

- Payment Terms
- Customer Price Group
- Shipment Method
- Salesperson/Purchaser
- Location
- GL Account
- Customer
- Vendor
- Item
- Sales Header
- Sales Line
- Purchase Header
- Purchase Line
- Gen. Journal Line
- Item Journal Line
- Customer Posting Group
- Vendor Posting Group
- Inventory Posting Group
- Unit of Measure
- Gen. Business Posting Group
- Gen. Product Posting Group
- General Posting Setup
- Territory
- Item Category
- Sales Price
- Purchase Price

# Apply payments automatically and reconciling bank accounts
You must regularly reconcile your bank, receivables, and payables accounts by applying payments recorded in the bank to their related open (unpaid) invoices and credit memos or other open entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, for example, by importing a bank statement file or feed to quickly register the payments. Payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change automatic applications before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you can set up prioritized rules that govern how payment text is automatically matched with entry information.

You can also reconcile bank accounts without simultaneously applying payments. You perform this work on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

To import bank statements as a bank feed, you must first set up and enable the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service, and then link your bank accounts to the related online bank accounts. For more information, see [set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

Alternatively, you can use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a bank statement file, from any format, to a data stream that you can import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

# OneDrive in Business Central FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers common questions about using OneDrive for Business with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Does this work with all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] clients?

Yes. You can open files in OneDrive from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile apps, when viewing card details in Microsoft Teams, or even from the Outlook add-in.  

## Is OneDrive the same as SharePoint for storing files?

No. OneDrive is private by default, allowing you to organize and share content, while SharePoint offers a shared file repository for your organization. Additionally, OneDrive is included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support consumer OneDrive?

No. This integration is exclusively intended for OneDrive for Business and only supports your work account. 

## Are all OneDrive for Business plans supported?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support standalone OneDrive for Business plans. OneDrive must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise plan. Learn more at [Compare OneDrive plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?market=af&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

## Where can I see OneDrive service health?

Administrators can access the Service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The dashboard includes OneDrive's service availability. Visit the [Service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth).

## Is OneDrive integration available to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises?

Yes, but unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, it does require more setup. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central on-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## How does this work in an organization with multiple environments?

The integration assumes that company names are unique across [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. When company names are unique across the organization, opening a file in OneDrive will copy the file to a folder named after the current company. If company names aren't unique across environments, files from identical company names might be placed together in the same folder.  

## We changed the company name. What happens to my previous files?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically migrate files you opened earlier in OneDrive to the new folder. After you rename your company, the Open in OneDrive action will copy files to a folder that has the new company name.   

## When I want to attach a file in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], how do I pick a file from OneDrive?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide a cloud file picker. You must download the file from OneDrive to your device, and then upload it to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## I want to open files in SharePoint instead. How do I do this?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide features to copy files to SharePoint and open them from a SharePoint library. Contact your Microsoft partner to understand your options, or search for apps on AppSource.  

## How do I turn off integration to OneDrive?

Run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide and turn off the **Use OneDrive for app features** and **Use OneDrive for system features** switches.

## Should I use the SharePoint Connection Setup page to connect to SharePoint?

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central on-premises, version 21 and 22

This page is a legacy feature where all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files from all users are sent to a single SharePoint folder. We recommend that you don't configure the Shared Documents FastTab on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page because this page is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup) and removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. We recommend that you use the **OneDrive Setup** instead.  

## Which version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports OneDrive?

Integration with OneDrive became available in 2021 release wave 2.  

## <a name="features"></a>Which features are affected by OneDrive integration?

In the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide for setting up OneDrive integration, you can turn on or off features for handling Business Central files in OneDrive. The features are divided between two options:

|Option|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Use for app features**|If you turn on this option, the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions are made available on files in Business Central, like files attached to documents or in the report inbox. These actions let users copy, open, and share files in OneDrive. Learn more in [Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).
|**Use for system features**|Turning on this option activates the following features:<ul><li> The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. Learn more in [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).</li><li> Sending a report to an Excel or Word file automatically copies the file to OneDrive, then opens it in the Excel or Word online. Learn more in [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).|

## Will Microsoft continue to improve the integration to OneDrive?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1).  

If you want to participate in improving OneDrive integration, or have an idea that would improve file sharing and collaboration in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

## Does OneDrive work for guest users and delegated admins?

OneDrive features don't work when you're signed in to Business Central as a guest user. For example, if you select **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** on a file, you get the message "Could not connect to your OneDrive for Business."

If you're signed in as a delegated admin, files are downloaded instead of connecting to OneDrive.

These limitations apply to all OneDrive-based features in Business Central, including file sharing, opening, or editing.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides information about how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using OneDrive with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Business Central can't find my OneDrive

When this message displays, "Could not determine the location of your OneDrive for Business, contact your partner to set this up.", check whether the user accessed their OneDrive at least one time. If they haven't, ask the person to visit [https://portal.office.com/onedrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) to set it up. This step can take a while. If the message still displays after 24 hours, contact Support.  

### I'm having problems sharing from Outlook

Learn more at [Can't share OneDrive files from Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-t-share-onedrive-files-from-outlook-com-05d4cb21-40a2-40e3-b111-82cddb82d22f) on Microsoft Support.

### Actions Open in OneDrive and Share are missing

There are a couple things you can check:

- Check that the application features for OneDrive are turned on in the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide. Learn more in [Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup](admin-onedrive-integration.md#configure-onedrive-using-onedrive-setup).
- Check that Microsoft OneDrive is set to **Agree** in the **Privacy Notices Status** page. Learn more in [Privacy Notices Status](privacy-notices-status.md).

# Sales

You create a sales invoice or sales order to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.

You must use sales orders if your sales process requires you to ship parts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't available right away. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use sales orders. In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. With sales orders, you can also use the order promising functionality to communicate certain delivery dates to your customers.  

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice or sales order when you agree on the sale. After the customer confirms the agreement, you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed.

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the customer pays it. For example, to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo or a sales return order to reverse the sale.

Good sales and marketing practices are all about how to make the best decisions at the right time. Marketing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a precise and timely overview of your contact information so you can serve your prospective customers more efficiently and increase customer satisfaction. Learn more at [Relationship Management](marketing-relationship-management.md).

If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities. For example, to process orders, manage inventory, and do your finances. Learn more at [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

In business environments where the customer must pay before products are delivered, such as in retail, you must wait for the receipt of payment before you deliver the products. In most cases, you process incoming payments some weeks after delivery by applying the payments to their related posted, unpaid sales invoices. Learn more at [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Sales documents can be sent as PDF files attached to email. The email body contains an extract of the sales document, such as products, total amount, and a link to the PayPal site. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

For all sales processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow. For example, an approval workflow can require that a manager approves large sales to certain customers. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Set up approval workflows

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Before you begin to use approval workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, then create the workflows.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values that represent scenarios supported by the application code.

# Manufacturing analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for manufacturing, such as:

- Utilization
- Capacity
- Work center load
- Production time
- Production scrap

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's manufacturing data:

- Power BI reports for manufacturing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in manufacturing analytics tools
- Built-in manufacturing reports

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of analysis you want to do and your role. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your manufacturing processes.

## Analytics needs in manufacturing

When you think about analytics in manufacturing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use data in different ways. For example, people in manufacturing interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
| COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
| Plant Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
| Factory worker | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor key performance indicators in manufacturing

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Businesses often use the following KPIs to monitor production performance:

- Capacity used (hours), either current or historical
- Utilization percentage, either current or historical
- Work center load percentage, allocated time (hours), or available capacity (hours)
- Cost amount variance or deviation percentage

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finished Production Order Breakdown Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for manufacturing in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Manufacturing KPIs](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md)

### Reports in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-manufacturing-app](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Manufacturing app](manufacturing-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of manufacturing data

Sometimes you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries** or **Capacity Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

<!-- coming later
To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on production data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-manufacturing.md).

## Built-in reports for manufacturing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help manufacturing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-manufacturing](includes/report-explorer-manufacturing.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for manufacturing, go to [Built-in production report overview](production-reports.md).

## On-screen manufacturing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you manufacturing overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [View the load in work and machine centers](production-how-to-view-the-load-on-work-centers.md)  

## Print barcodes for finished goods on production orders

To remove a step or two from the process of tracking finished goods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a **Print Label** action on the **Released Production Order** and **Finished Production Order** pages. The action prints a report that includes the **Item No.**, **Description**, **Unit of Measure**, and 1D and 2D barcode information from the orders. On the request page, you can also specify whether to print the **Lot No.**, **Serial No.** or **Package No.** values as barcodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some printers and barcode/QR code formats require a specific implementation. You might need to upload a different Word template.
>
> Check with your equipment supplier to learn how to print Word documents on your device.
 If you decide to clone the report to create your own custom version, you can easily connect if you select **Prod. Output Item Label** on the **Report Selection Production Order** page.

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Security groups make it easier for administrators to manage user permissions. For example, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, they're reusable across Dynamics 365 applications, such as SharePoint Online, CRM Online, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Administrators add permissions to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security groups, and when they add users to the group the permissions apply to all members. For example, an administrator can create a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security group that gives salespeople the ability to create and post sales orders. Or, let purchasers do the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to grant certain permissions to users based on their membership of a security group. To control whether users can access an environment based on their membership of a security group, see [Manage Access to Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access).

## Business Central online and on-premises

You can use security groups for the online and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Depending on your version, create groups in one of the following ways:

* For the online version, use Microsoft Entra security groups. To learn more about creating the group, go to [Create, edit, or delete a security group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group).
* For on-premises, security groups are only supported if the deployment is using Windows authentication. To create security groups for on-premises, use Windows Active Directory groups. To learn more, go to [Create a Group Account in Windows Active Directory](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/create-a-group-account-in-active-directory). 

Afterward, create a corresponding security group in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then link it to the group you created. To learn more, go to [Add a security group in Business Central](#add-a-security-group-in-business-central).

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set up a special type of user with a Windows Group license type in a version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-prem that's earlier than 2023 release wave 1, when you upgrade [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts the user to a security group. The new security group has the same name as the Windows group name. The security group gives you a better overview of the group members and their effective permissions.

## Add a security group in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Security Groups**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a group.
1. Create the link to your group, as follows:

    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, choose the group in the **Microsoft Entra security group name** field.
    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, choose the group in the **Windows group name** field.

> [!NOTE]
> The users show in the **Members** card on the FactBox pane or the **Security Group Members** page only if they're added as users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about adding users, go to [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

### Assign permissions to a security group

1. On the **Security Groups** page, choose the group, and then choose the **Permissions** action.
1. Assign permissions in the following ways:

    * To assign permission sets individually, in the **Permission Set** field, choose the permissions to assign.
    * To assign multiple permission sets, choose the **Add multiple** action, and then choose the sets to assign.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company** column to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** column blank. [Learn more](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## Review the permissions in a security group

On the **Security Groups** page, the FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets** that are assigned to the group. Each user listed in the **Members** card has those permissions. The **Permission Set by Security Group** action provides a more detailed view. There you can also explore the individual permissions in each security group.

Permissions are also available on the **Users** page. The FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets from Security Group** and **Security Group Memberships** cards for the selected user.

## Security groups and user groups

> [!NOTE]
> User groups will no longer be available in a future release.

Security groups are very similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Active Directory, depending on whether you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, respectively. Groups benefit administrators because they can use them with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.

### Optional: Convert user groups to permission sets

In 2023 release wave 1 and later, you can convert user groups to permission sets in your tenant. The permission sets provide the same functionality as user groups. Here are some examples:

* You can use the **Users** FactBox to manage permissions for users.
* You can drill down on the permission set name to add other permission sets to the set you're working on. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-add-other-permission-sets).

Use the **User Group Migration** assisted setup guide to convert your groups. To start the guide, on the **Feature Management** page, find **Feature: Convert user group permissions**, and then choose **All Users** in the **Enabled For** field. The assisted setup guide offers the following options for the conversion.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign to user     | Assign the permissions in user groups directly to the users who were assigned to the group, and remove their user group assignments.        |
|Convert to a permission set     | Create a new permission for the permissions in each user group. The new permission set is assigned to all members of each user group.          |

### License configurations still apply

You can configure permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on licenses. Those permissions are directly assigned to new users. These configurations still apply, even if you start using security groups.

To use security groups exclusively, we recommend that you remove the license configurations. To learn more about license configurations, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

You can remove license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

# Set Up a Loaner Program
Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a loaner program, loan items to your customers, and track receipts when customers return the items. Additionally, you can add comments about loaners in one of two ways:  
  
* Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
* Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  

## To set up a loaner  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new loaner card. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner. Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to enter the next available loaner number.  
4. Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
5. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, choose the relevant unit of measure.

# Create service invoices or credit memos

Ease in invoicing your service orders is a key feature of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can set up your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that a service technician in the field can create an invoice for a service that isn't connected to a contract or order. Alternatively, set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that you invoice service contracts periodically. The invoice period for each contract defines how often you invoice it.

## To invoice several service contracts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Service Contract Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Set the filters you want to apply.  
3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date to use as the posting date on the service invoices.  
4. In the **Invoice to Date** field, enter the date up to which you want to invoice contracts. The batch job will include the contracts with the next invoice dates, up to this date.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Invoices**.  
6. Choose **OK** to create the service invoices.  
  
You can also invoice a service contract directly from the **Service Contract** page, if the next invoice date on the contract is earlier than the working date.

## To invoice a service contract from the Service Contract page   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service contract to invoice, and open the contract card.  
3. Choose **Create Service Invoice** action. 
4. Choose **Yes** to create the service invoices.  
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > You can't create service invoices for the service contract when the **Change Status** field value is set to **Open**.  

## To post an invoice from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to define the part of service that you'll charge the customer for.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order to invoice, and open the order card.  
3. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and then specify the quantities for which you will charge the customer in the **Qty. to Invoice** field.  
  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can invoice the customer for the registered service either fully or in parts. If you choose to invoice the customer fully, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Quantity** field. You can post a full invoice together with a full shipment, and you can post a full invoice for an already posted full shipment that isn't invoiced or consumed.  
   >  
   > When you post a partial invoice, there are two ways of specifying the quantity to invoice. If you're going to post the service with **the Ship and Invoice** option, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If you want to invoice an already posted shipment, the quantity to invoice must not be larger than the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field.  
  
5. Choose **Post**, and then either **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice**. To learn more, go to [Posting in Service Management](service-service-posting.md).  
  
 The service line you selected is posted. You can post several service lines at the same time by selecting them and choosing **Post**. If you do, make sure you fill in all the necessary information on the lines.  
  
 When you post the order with the **Invoice** option, a posted service invoice is created along with the corresponding ledger entries and updates to the relevant fields on the service lines of the order. Also, previously posted shipment documents are updated with the invoiced quantities. If you select the **Ship and Invoice** posting option, a posted shipment is created.

## To create a service invoice manually  

Typically, after you post a service order with the **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice** option, a service invoice is posted automatically. Yet, you may need to issue an invoice that isn't linked to a service contract or order. This procedure explains how to issue an invoice at the same time that the customer receives the service.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service invoice.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have set up number series for service invoices on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select **Enter** to select the next available service invoice number.  
  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of a customer. Select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
    The customer fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** card.  
  
5. Enter a date in the **Posting Date** field. This date will appear on the posted entries. This field shows your current work date, but you can change the date.  
6. In the **Document Date** field, enter a date that will appear on the printed invoice and be used to calculate the due date.  
7. Fill in the service lines of the invoice. Fill in the **Type**, **No.**, and **Quantity** fields to register items, resources and costs that have been used in servicing.

## To create an invoice that combines posted shipment lines from one or more service orders 

You might need to create a service invoice for a service that's already shipped, either from one or several service orders, but not yet invoiced or consumed. You can fill in the invoice lines automatically with the selected posted shipment lines for a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
3. Create invoice lines for services shipped but not invoiced. Alternatively, you can use the **Get Shipment Lines** action to add posted shipment lines to the invoice.  
4. Post the service invoice.  
  
 The posted service invoice and the corresponding ledger entries are created. Previously posted shipment documents update with the invoiced quantities and the quantities on the service lines of the source orders.  

## To create a service credit memo  

You typically use a service credit memo document when a customer returns an item. However, you can also use them to reimburse a customer or to correct a invoice that was a mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. The **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields display the work date. If needed, you can change it.    
4. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the compensation that will be given to the customer.  

## Correct errors in service invoices

You can delete service invoices that have service ledger entries associated with them. This means that you can correct errors or make changes to service invoices without getting stuck or losing data. For example, if you forget to assign a product posting group to a G/L account, you can add it later and recreate the service invoice.

Use the :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png" alt-text="Delete action icon"::: action to delete a service invoice. 

When you delete a service invoice, the following things happen:

* Post a corrective service ledger entry
* Restore the invoicing date and period in the contract, which lets you create the invoice again.

> [!NOTE]
> You can revert several invoices, but you must do so sequentially, starting from the last invoice.
>
> You can't delete a service invoice if its details, such as the invoicing period or the **Prepaid** toggle were changed in the related service contract. Make sure that you delete invoices before you change settings on the service contract.

# Set up and report Intrastat

All companies in the European Union must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. This is referred to as Intrastat Reporting. You use the **Intrastat Journal** page to complete periodic Intrastat reports.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

## Required and optional Setups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer cards and Vendor cards include a field, **Intrastat Partner Type**, that has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: *"" (blank)*, *Company*, and *Person*. The **Intrastat Partner Type** field has replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. **Partner Type** is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). **Intrastat Partner Type** is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, you can specify different values for the two fields, if you need to.
>
> However, note that if the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

Before you can use the Intrastat journal to report Intrastat information, there are several things you must set up:  

* **Intrastat Setup**: Intrastat Setup page is used to enable intrastat reporting and set defaults for it. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals) or both depending on thresholds set by your local regulations. You can also set default transaction types for regular and return documents, used for nature of transaction reporting.
* **Intrastat journal templates**: You must set up the Intrastat journal templates and batches you will use. Because Intrastat is reported monthly, you must create 12 Intrastat journal batches based on the same template.  
* **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have established numerical codes that classify items and services. You specify these codes on items.
* **Transaction nature codes**: Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions, such as ordinary purchase and sale, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all of the codes that apply to your country/region. You use these codes on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents, and when you process returns.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature code for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review and/or add new transaction nature codes in the **Transaction Types** page according to the requirements in your country. You should also review and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for private individual or non-VAT registered businesses customers in the relevant **Customer** page. If you are unsure about the correct intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

* **Transport methods**: There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods. **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not require these codes, however, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning.  
* **Transaction specifications**: Use these to supplement the descriptions from the transaction types.  
* **Country of origin**: Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country where it was significantly processed.
* **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import**: This is the VAT-ID number of the partner operator in the Member State of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among Member States, and allows Member States to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the Member State of import.

> [!NOTE]
> The business partner VAT-ID to use can differ, depending on the business circumstance. For example, the ID to use differs for scenarios such as chain sales, where a supplier sells a product to another country, and then that company resells the item to another business in the same country, triangular trade, and so on. If you are unsure about the correct VAT-ID to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

Optionally, you can also set up:

* **Areas**: Use these to supplement information about countries and regions.  
* **Entry/exit points**: Use these to specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. Heathrow Airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information will also be copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.  

### To set up Intrastat templates and batches

The Intrastat batch jobs include only item entries, and not general ledger entries. If you have general ledger entries that qualify for Intrastat reporting, you must enter them manually. For example, if you purchase a computer from another EU country or region, the computer is not placed in inventory, but is posted to a general ledger account. You must manually enter this type of entry in the Intrastat journal.  

You can export the entries to a file that you can send to your Intrastat authorities. You can also print a report, manually enter the information on the forms from your authorities, and then submit the information.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that you set up an Intrastat journal batch for each month.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.  
3. To create batches, choose the **Batches** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Statistics Period** field, enter the statistics period as a four-digit number, where the first two digits represent the year and the next two digits represent the month. For example, enter 1706 for June, 2017.

### To set up transport methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transport Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up which Intrastat report fields are mandatory

In some countries/regions, such as Spain and UK, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or some other values when sales are over a certain threshold. On the **Intrastat Setup** page, you can select to make **Intrastat Checklist Setup** to set mandatory fields on the **Intrastat Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
3. On the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page, select in the **Field Name** to pick Intrastat report field you want to make mandatory.

### Czechia

Specifically for Czech businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up commodity codes

All items that you buy or sell must have a commodity code.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Commodity Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To assign a commodity code to an item, go to the **Item Card** page, expand the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, and then enter the code in the **Commodity Code** field.

### Italy

Specifically for Italian businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up transaction nature codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transaction Nature Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> If you frequently use a particular transaction nature code, you can make it the default. To do this, go to the **Intrastat Setup** page, and choose the code.

## To report Intrastat

After you fill in the Intrastat journal, you can run the **Checklist report** action to make sure that all information in the journal is correct. Mandatory fields you have set in **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page that are missing values will be shown in Errors and warning fact box on the **Intrastat Journal** page. Afterward, you can print an Intrastat report as a form, or create a file to submit to the tax authority in your country/region.  

### To fill in Intrastat journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal** and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the journal batch.  
4. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher.  
5. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the Intrastat journal. You can edit the lines if needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The batch job retrieves only the entries that contain a country/region code for which an Intrastat code has been entered on the **Countries/Regions** page. Therefore, you must enter Intrastat codes for the country/region codes for which you will run the batch job. The batch job sets the **Partner VAT ID** field to *QV999999999999* for private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses (customers with the **Intrastat Partner Type** field set to *Person*), and it uses the value of the **Transaction Type** field on the posted item ledger entry or job ledger entry.

### To modify Intrastat journals lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. User filter pane to filter Intrastat Journal lines based on some criteria. For example, filter on **Partner VAT ID** fields with the value *QV999999999999*.
4. Choose **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) and select **Edit in Excel**
5. In Excel, modify the Intrastat journal lines that you filtered out. For example, modify **Transaction Type** field values.  
6. Publish the changes that you have made in Excel back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] versions that do not support [**Edit in Excel**](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel) for journals, you can create configuration packages to export and import Intrastat journal lines to Excel. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content.

### Report Intrastat on a form or a file

To get the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat – Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in. If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, choose the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or choose **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Prints Intrastat Journal** action.  
5. On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then specify whether this is a **Receipt** or a **Shipment**.  
6. Choose **Send to** to print the report.  

### Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file. Before creating the file, you can print a checklist that contains the same information that will be in the file.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or by choosing the **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Create File** action.  
5. On the batch job page, choose the **OK** button.  
6. Choose **Save**.  
7. Browse to the location where you want to save the file, enter the file name, and then choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When a line in the Intrastat report has a supplementary unit of measure, the weight of the item will not be shown, since this value is not required.

## Reorganize Intrastat journals

Because you must submit an Intrastat report every month, and you create a new journal batch for each report, you will eventually have many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically. You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
3. Choose the journal batches to be deleted, and then choose the **Delete** button.  

## Tariff numbers

In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish 8-digit item codes for various items. In order for item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, you must have entered the information about the tariff number in the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with and enter them in the **Tariff Numbers** page.

In the **Tariff Numbers** page, add all the codes that you use. You must enter the codes on the item card before you begin to post. When you have set up the codes, enter them in the **Tariff No.** field on the item card. You must also fill in the **Net Weight** field on the item card.

# Synchronizing data in Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can decide whether to synchronize data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of row, you can synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or vice versa. For more information, see [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronization uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronization rules
* Coupled records

When synchronization is set up you can couple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows to synchronize their data. You can start a synchronization manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides an overview of the ways you can synchronize.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  See  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronization|Synchronize on a row-by-row basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize individual records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] row, such as an account. This is typically how users will work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|[Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
|  |Synchronize on a table mapping basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table with an table [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table.|[Synchronize Individual Table Mappings](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
||Synchronize all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the records that have been modified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables since the last synchronization.|[Synchronizing All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronization of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are mapped, and create new records or rows in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronization synchronizes all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronization when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronization can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronization](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronization|Synchronize all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronization](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

> [!NOTE]
> The synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the scheduled execution of job queue entries and does not guarantee real time data consistency between two services. For real time data conistency you should explore [Business Central Virtual Tables](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-overview) or Business Central APIs.   

## Standard table mapping for synchronization

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

> [!TIP]
> You can reset configuration changes made to integration table and field mappings to their default settings by selecting the mappings, and then choosing **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Dataverse** actions will not be available on pages, for example, the Customer Card page, for records that do not respect the table filter on the integration table mapping.

### Tip for admins: viewing table mappings

You can view the mapping between the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables and the columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add additional mapping logic. For example, this can be useful if you need to troubleshoot synchronization.

## Use virtual tables to get more data

When you're setting up your integration, you can use virtual tables to make more data available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], without help from a developer.

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains objects that are also called virtual tables. Those table objects are not related to the virtual tables that you use with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about virtual tables, go to the following articles:

* [Create and edit virtual tables that contain data from an external data source](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities) (Power Apps documentation)
* [Business Central Virtual Table for Microsoft Dataverse Admin Reference](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-admin-reference) ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation)

To use virtual tables, you must install the **Business Central Virtual Entity** app from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/dynamics-365/microsoftdynsmb.businesscentral_virtualentity). 

After you install the app, you can enable virtual tables from one of the following pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* When you run the **Set up Dataverse connection** assisted setup guide, you can use the **Dataverse Available Virtual Tables** page to select multiple virtual tables. Afterward, the tables are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the PowerApps Maker Portal. 
* From the **Dataverse Connection Setup**, **Virtual Tables**, and **Available Virtual Tables** pages.  
* From the Power App Maker Portal.

## Synchronize data from multiple companies or environments

You can synchronize data from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies or environments with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. In multi-company synchronization scenarios, there are several things to consider.

### Set company IDs

When you synchronize records, we set a company ID on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity to clarify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company the records came from. Integration table mappings have integration table filter fields that take the company ID into account. To include a table mapping in a multi-company setup, on the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox. The setting optimizes how integration table filter fields filter company IDs in a multi-company setup.

For integration table mappings that synchronize documents, such as orders, quotes, and opportunities, if you choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox the integration only considers entities that have the company ID of the current [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. To synchronize documents, for example, between Business Central and Sales, users in Sales must specify the company ID on the documents. Otherwise, the documents won't synchronize.  

For all other integration table mappings, choosing the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox removes the filter on company ID. The synchronization will consider related entities, regardless of their company ID.

### Specify the synchronization direction

If you enable multi-company support on an integration table mapping, we recommend that you set the direction of the mapping to **FromIntegration**. If you set the direction to **ToIntegration** or **Bidirectional**, it's a good idea to use **Table Filter** and **Integration Table Filter** to control which entities synchronize with which company. It's also a good idea to use match-based coupling to avoid creating duplicate records. To learn more about match-based coupling, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#customize-the-match-based-coupling).

### Use unique numbers

If your number series doesn't guarantee that primary key values are unique to each company, we recommend that you use prefixes. To start using prefixes, create a transformation rule on the integration field mapping. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Handle differences in field values](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#handle-differences-in-field-values).

# Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger
When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, production output, or negative adjustments, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively. The next step in the process is to post the inventory values to the inventory accounts in the general ledger.  

There are two ways to reconcile the inventory ledger with the general ledger:  

* Manually, by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  
* Automatically, every time that you post an inventory transaction.  

## Post Inventory Cost to G/L Batch Job  
When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, the general ledger entries are created based on value entries. You have the option to summarize general ledger entries for each value entry, or create general ledger entries for each combination of posting date, location code, inventory posting group, general business posting group, and general product posting group.  

The posting dates of the general ledger entries are set to the posting date of the corresponding value entry, except when the value entry falls in a closed accounting period. In this case, the value entry is skipped, and you must change either the general ledger setup or the user setup to enable posting in the date range.  

When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, you might receive errors because of missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For other errors, the batch job does not post the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled, **Skipped Entries**. To post these entries, you must first fix the errors. To see a list of errors before you run the batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. This report lists all of the errors that are encountered during a test posting. You can fix the errors, and then run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.  

## Automatic Cost Posting  
To set up cost posting to the general ledger to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. The posting date of the general ledger entry is the same as the posting date of the item ledger entry.  

## Account Types  
During reconciliation, inventory values are posted to the inventory account in the balance sheet. The same amount, but with the reverse sign, is posted to the relevant balancing account. Usually the balancing account is an income statement account. However, when you post direct cost related to consumption or output, the balancing account is a balance sheet account. The type of the item ledger entry and value entry determines which general ledger account to post to.  

The entry type indicates which general ledger account to post to. This is determined either by the sign of the quantity on the item ledger entry or the valued quantity on the value entry, since the quantities always have the same sign. For example, a sales entry with a positive quantity describes an inventory decrease caused by a sale, and a sales entry with a negative quantity describes an inventory increase caused by a sales return.  

### Example  
The following example shows a bike chain that is manufactured from purchased links. This example shows how the various general ledger account types are used in a typical scenario.  

The **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page is selected, and the following setup is defined.  

The following table shows how the link is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 1.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 0.02|  

The following table shows how the chain is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 150.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 25.00|  

The following table shows how the work center is set up on the work center card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Direct Unit Cost**|LCY 2.00|  
|**Indirect Cost Percentage**|10|  

##### Scenario  
1. The user purchases 150 links and posts the purchase order as received. (Purchase)  
2. The user posts the purchase order as invoiced. This creates an overhead amount of LCY 3.00 to be allocated and a variance amount of LCY 18.00. (Purchase)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Purchase)  
    2. The direct cost is posted. (Purchase)  
    3. The indirect cost is calculated and posted. (Purchase)  
    4. The purchase variance is calculated and posted (only for standard-cost items). (Purchase)  
3. The user sells one chain and posts the sales order as shipped. (Sale)  
4. The user posts the sales order as invoiced. (Sale)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Sale)  
    2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) is posted. (Sale)  

        ![Results of sales posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_sales.png "Results of sales posting to GL accounts")  
5. The user posts consumption of 150 links, which is the number of links used to produce one chain. (Consumption, Material)  

    ![Results of material posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_material.png "Results of material posting to GL accounts")  
6. The work center used 60 minutes to produce the chain. The user posts the conversion cost. (Consumption, Capacity)  

    1. The direct costs are posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  
    2. The indirect costs are calculated and posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  

        ![Results of capacity posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_capacity.png "Results of capacity posting to GL accounts")  
7. The user posts the expected cost of one chain. (Output)  
8. The user finishes the production order and runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. (Output)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Output)  
    2. The direct cost is transferred from the WIP account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    3. The indirect cost (overhead) is transferred from the indirect cost account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    4. This results in a variance amount of LCY 157.00. Variances are only calculated for standard-cost items. (Output)  

        ![Results of output posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_output.png "Results of output posting to GL accounts")  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  For the sake of simplicity, only one variance account is shown. In reality, five different accounts exist:  
        >   
        >  * Material Variance  
        >  * Capacity Variance  
        >  * Capacity Overhead Variance  
        >  * Subcontracting Variance  
        >  * Manufacturing Overhead Variance  

9. The user revalues the chain from LCY 150.00 to LCY 140.00. (Adjustment/Revaluation/Rounding/Transfer)  

    ![Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_adjustment.png "Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts")

# Warehouse management overview

There are two things that are important to all businesses that physically move goods in and out of their warehouse:

* They have an overview of inventory levels and item placement in the warehouse.
* They can quickly and accurately receive, pick, and ship items.

To help businesses achieve those things, warehouse features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add the following capabilities to inventory management:

* Bins
* Warehouse shipments
* Inventory picks
* Movement worksheet

Implement these features in different combinations to tailor your warehouse processes for your business. Allow for increasing complexity as your company grows and your processes change.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important to choose options that improve your processes without causing overhead. The following table gives an overview of typical configurations for dealing with physical goods.

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Example of Inbound Flow|Example of Outbound Flow|Example of Internal Flow|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|

Complexity increases with the size of your organization and how many departments and people are involved. A process can be simple, for example, when the same person creates and posts a sales document. Processes can also be more complex, and involve several steps and people. The following steps are an example of a more complex process:

1. An order processor creates a sales order.
1. A warehouse manager creates pick instructions.
1. A warehouse employee finishes the flow by posting the warehouse shipment.

The level of complexity is also affected by the types of documents you use in your warehouse activities. For example, you can use warehouse receipt and warehouse put-away documents for your inbound flow, but use inventory pick documents for your outbound flow.

Another factor that impacts complexity is how your physical warehouse is represented in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Modeling the physical warehouse](#modeling-the-physical-warehouse).

## Modeling the physical warehouse

You have several options for representing the real-world setup of your warehouse in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Your choices determine how you work with warehouse features.

The placement of items can be shelves, locations, or bins, and there are pros and cons for each option.

### Locations and bins

To handle physical goods, you must have at least one location. You can use multiple locations or use bins to model your warehouse and organizational structure.

Typically, locations are the preferred way to organize operations that are distributed across geographic areas. In some cases, however, you might want to create several locations that are located at the same place. Using locations has the following advantages:

* Grant access by using the **Warehouse Employee** and **Responsibility Centers** pages.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. Learn more at [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Specify default dimensions and use different inventory posting setups.
* Set up planning parameters. Learn more at [Planning parameters](production-about-planning-functionality.md#planning-parameters).  
* Use different warehouse features for each location.

### Shelves and bins

If you always store an item in the same place, you can use the **Shelf No.** field on the **Item Card** or **Stock-keeping Unit Card** pages. This field can be a basic manual storage system in environments without bins. The field's value is copied from the item card to document lines and reports, but it's only informational. The value isn't used in warehouse activities or availability calculations.

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and are used to make suggestions about the placement of items:

* One or more fixed bins for an item.
* Bins for specific operations, such as a shipping bin or a production output bin.
* Bin capacity and weight restrictions (for directed put-away and pick only).
* Bin rating (for directed put-away and pick only).

## Typical warehouse workflow

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|In a basic flow on an order-by-order basis, use an inventory put-away to record the receipt of items at locations, including any over-receipt. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the receipt, use a warehouse receipt.|[Inbound flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Record the shipment of items from warehouse locations. On an order-by-order basis, use an inventory pick. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the shipment, use a warehouse shipment.|[Outbound flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Handle items within the warehouse location. For example, when you move components to production or do a physical inventory count.|[Internal flow](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md)|

## Terminology related to warehouse management

### Complexity levels

We use the terms "basic" and "advanced" to differentiate between levels of complexity. This simple differentiation covers several levels of complexity in location setups, each supported by different warehouse documents. The most advanced level of warehousing is referred to as "Directed put-away and pick." To use directed put-away and pick for a location, turn on the **directed put-away and pick** toggle on the **Location Card** page.

### Warehouse flows

* Inbound flow - Move items into the warehouse location and make them available, such as purchases and inbound transfers.
* Outbound flow - Pick and ship items to customers or other locations.
* Internal flow - Handle items within a location. For example, move components to production or count physical inventory.

### Basic documents  

The following documents are used in basic warehouse flows.

* Inventory Put-away
* Inventory Pick
* Inventory Movement
* Item Journal
* Item Reclassification Journal

### Advanced documents  

The following documents are used in advanced warehouse flows.

* Warehouse Receipt
* Put-away Worksheet
* Warehouse Put-away
* Pick Worksheet
* Warehouse Pick
* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Movement
* Internal Warehouse Pick
* Internal Warehouse Put-away
* Bin Creation Worksheet
* Bin Content Creation Worksheet
* Warehouse Item Journal
* Warehouse Item Reclassification Journal

### Pages and settings

This section describes the concepts behind the key pages and settings for warehousing.

#### Bins and bin content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It's the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as *bin contents*. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

Bin contents can be **Fixed**, **Dedicated**, or **Default** to define how to use the bin content. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as *floating* bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code. The fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin is emptied, the bin content doesn't disappear. You can select the bin again as soon as its contents are replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource that uses the bin. For example, a machine center. Other non-pick content, such as outbound quantities on a shipment posting, can be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **Default** bin property to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At locations that use directed put-away and pick, the default bin property isn't used. At locations where bins are required, the property specifies where to place items in inbound flows. In outbound flows, the property specifies where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If outbound items are placed in several bins, items are taken from the non-default bins first, to empty that bin content, and the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

You can have one default bin per item per location.  

#### Bin type

Locations that use directed put-away and pick can use bin types. Bin types control the activities that you allow for a bin. 

The following types of bins are available:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items that are received but aren't put away.|  
|SHIP|Items that are picked for warehouse shipment lines but aren't posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to store in large units of measure but that you don't want to access for picking purposes. These bins aren't used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, so their use might be limited. This type of bin is useful when you purchase a large quantity of items. The bins should always have a low bin-ranking, so that items with higher-ranking PUTPICK bins are put away first. Regularly replenish this type of bin so that their items are available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. You can only use movements to replenishment of these bins, not put-aways.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both put-aways and picks. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. Set up your bulk storage bins with lower bin rankings than ordinary pick bins or bins in your forward picking area.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling checkboxes selected by default. Content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

You can operate your warehouse with all of the eight possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.
With the exceptions of the PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY types of bins, the bin type defines the activity allowed for a bin. For example, you can only use a RECEIVE type of bin to receive items or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use movements to move items to RECEIVE and QC bins. Similarly, use movements to move items from SHIP and QC bins.  

#### Bin ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how to collect items in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins. Items are suggested for picks and put-aways based on the bin ranks.

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Pick processes suggest items with the highest bin ranking from bin content first. Bin replenishment suggests lower-ranking bins before higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking and bin contents are the basic properties that guide warehouse employees in the warehouse.  

#### Bin setup

In advanced warehousing, you can specify the following capacity values to control how, and in which, bins you store items:

* Quantity
* Total cubage
* Weight  

You can assign a base unit of measure (UOM) to items. A base UOM might be pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also create larger UOMs based on your base UOM. For example, if pieces are your base UOM, a pallet might equal 16 pieces.  

If an item has more than one UOM, set the maximum quantity for every UOM on the item card. If you handle an item in pieces and pallets, the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin isn't calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item are set up on the item.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use multiple UOMs at locations that use directed put-away and pick. In all other configurations, you can only use bin contents in the base UOM. In transactions with a UOM that's larger than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

#### Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed for locations.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or more bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone are assigned to the bins that are created for the zone.  

#### Warehouse class

In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to the following entities: 

* Items
* Bins
* Zones

Warehouse classes control where to store items. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, you might store items in the receiving zone as frozen, hazardous, or another class.

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually choose the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code doesn't match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins aren't assigned, then the quantity can't be received.  

#### Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant. Inventory is often organized in bins and zones.

#### First expired first out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** checkbox on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the **Location Card** page, item-tracked items are picked at the location according to their expiration date. Items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items have serial or lot numbers assigned. If some, but not all, of the quantity on the line has serial or lot numbers assigned, the remaining quantity is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to the temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

Learn more at [Enable Picking Items by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).

#### Put-away template

Put-away templates specify a set of prioritized rules that apply when you create put-aways. For example, a put-away template can require you to place items in a bin with bin content that has the same UOM. If a similar bin with enough capacity can't be found, the item must be placed in an empty bin. You assign a put-away template to an item and a location.

# Subcontract manufacturing

Subcontracting selected operations to vendor is common in many manufacturing companies. Subcontracting can be a rare occurrence or can be an integral part of all production processes.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides several tools for managing subcontract work:  

- Work Centers with assigned vendor: This feature enables you to set up a work center that is associated with a vendor (subcontractor). This work center is called a subcontract work center. You can specify a subcontract work center on a routing operation, which allows you to easily process the subcontracted activity. In addition, the cost of the operation can be designated at the routing or the work center level.  
- Work Center cost based on units or time: This feature enables you to specify whether costs associated with the work center are based on the production time or a flat charge per unit. Although subcontractors commonly use a flat charge per unit to charge for their services, the application can handle both options (production time and flat charge per unit).  
- Subcontracting Worksheet: This feature allows you to find the production orders with material ready to send to a subcontractor and to automatically create purchase orders for subcontract operations from production order routings. The application automatically posts the purchase order charges to the production order during the posting of the purchase order. Only production orders with a status of released can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

## Subcontract work centers  

Subcontract Work Centers are set up the same as regular work centers with additional information. They're assigned to routings in the same manner as other work centers.  

### Subcontract work center fields  

This **Subcontractor No.** field designates the work center as a subcontract work center. You can enter the number of a subcontractor who supplies the work center. This field can be used to administer work centers, which aren't in-house but perform processing under contract.  

If you subcontract with the vendor for a different rate for each process, then select the **Specific Unit Cost** field. This setting lets you set up a cost on each routing line and saves the time of reentering each purchase order. The cost on the routing line is used in processing instead of the cost on the work center cost fields. Selecting the **Specific Unit Cost** field calculates costs for the vendor by the routing operation.  

If you subcontract at a single rate per vendor, leave the **Specific Unit Cost** field blank. The costs are set up by filling in **Direct Unit Cost**, **Indirect Cost %**, and **Overhead Rate** fields.  

### Routings that use subcontract work centers

Subcontract work centers can be used for operations on routings in the same way as regular work centers.  

You can set up a routing that uses an outside work center as a standard operational step. Alternatively, you can modify the routing for a particular production order to include an outside operation. This might be needed in an emergency such as a server not working correctly, or during a temporary period of higher demand where work you normally do in-house must be sent to a subcontractor.  

For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## Calculate subcontracting worksheets and create subcontract purchase orders  

After you calculate the subcontracting worksheet, the relevant document is created. In this case, a purchase order.  

The **Subcontracting Worksheet** page functions like the **Planning Worksheet** by calculating the needed supply, in this case purchase orders, which you review in the worksheet and then create with the **Carry Out Action Message** function.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only production orders with status **Released** can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

### To calculate the subcontracting worksheet  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To calculate the worksheet, choose the **Calculate Subcontracts** action.  
3. On the **Calculate Subcontracts** page, set filters for the subcontracted operations, or the work centers where they're performed, to calculate only the relevant production orders.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

    Review the lines on the **Subcontracting Worksheet** page. The information in this worksheet comes from the production order and production order routing lines and flows to the purchase order when that document is created. You can delete a row from the worksheet without affecting the original information, just as you can with the other worksheets. The information will reappear the next time you run the **Calculate Subcontracts** function.  

### To create the subcontract purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3. Select the **Print Orders** field to print the purchase order as it is created.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

If all subcontracted operations are sent to the same vendor location, then only one purchase order is created.  

The worksheet line that was turned into a purchase order is deleted from the worksheet. After a purchase order is created, it won't appear in the worksheet again.  

## Posting subcontract purchase orders  

After the Subcontractor Purchase Orders are created, they can be posted. Receiving the order posts a Capacity Ledger Entry to the production order and invoicing the order posts the direct cost of the purchase order to the production order.  

## To post a subcontract purchase order
 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase order that is created from the subcontracting worksheet.  

    On the purchase order lines, you see the same information that was in the worksheet. The **Prod. Order No.**, **Prod. Order Line No.**, **Operation No.**, and **Work Center No.** fields are filled in with the information from the source production order.  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

When the purchase is posted as received, an output journal entry is automatically posted for the production order if the subcontract operation is the last operation on the production order routing.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Posting output automatically for an ongoing production order when subcontracted items are received may not be desired. Reasons for this could be that the expected output quantity that is posted may be different from the actual quantity and that the posting date of the automatic output is misleading.  
>
> To avoid that the expected output of a production order is posted when subcontract purchases are received, make sure the subcontracted operation is not the last one. Alternatively, insert a new last operation for the final output quantity.  

When the purchase order is posted as invoiced, then the direct cost of the purchase order is posted to the production.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity posted via subcontract purchase orders. Don't be confused by the fact that posting a receipt might trigger posting of output. These transactions are separate and the expected cost of output is calculated independently.

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central

This article provides an overview of what an administrator can do to control OneDrive for Business integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers benefit from automatic integration with no extra setup required to use the open and share in OneDrive features. With the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, you can give users access to even more OneDrive features, like opening Excel file in OneDrive&mdash;or even turn off all features.  

## Configure OneDrive for integration with Business Central

This section discusses requirements that must be met in OneDrive for Business to configure the integration with Business Central and task you can do to manage the integration.

### Minimum requirements

* Each user must have a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and OneDrive as part of a Microsoft 365 plan.
* OneDrive must be set up for each user.

### Managing privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've chosen to deploy Business Central and OneDrive to different countries or regions, the files generated by Business Central and placed in OneDrive may cross data residency boundaries. Make sure to confirm your organization's policies and government compliance requirements for data residency before enabling the connection to OneDrive.

Administrators and end users control the content stored in OneDrive, and this data is owned solely by your organization. For more information, see [How SharePoint and OneDrive safeguard your data in the cloud](/sharepoint/safeguarding-your-data). You can also visit our [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)<!--(https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)-->, which explains the data that Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.

By enabling this service connection, you agree:

(a) to share data from Dynamics 365 Business Central with the service provider, who will use it according to its terms and privacy policy; (b) the compliance levels of the service provider may be different than Dynamics 365 Business Central; and (c) Microsoft may share your contact information with this service provider if needed for it to operate and troubleshoot the service.

## Configure Business Central

With Business Central online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive is automatically configured for you, and the OneDrive features are readily available to users by default. If you want to turn off some or all of the features off, you can use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide in the Business Central client.

Configuring Business Central on-premises is different because the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't configured for you. You'll have to do it manually. For more information, see [Configuring OneDrive Integration with Business Central On-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

### About multiple environments

OneDrive integration is configured per environment, that is, your settings will apply to all companies in that environment. If your organization has more than one environment, you'll have to configure OneDrive integration for each.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you'll see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure OneDrive file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]
4. Choose **Next**>**Done**.

### Switching to new OneDrive integration after upgrade

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup was introduced in 2022 release wave 2, version 21.0. Previously, the OneDrive integration used the **SharePoint Connection Setup**, which has been deprecated and will be removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. After you've upgraded to version 21, OneDrive will still work as before. But we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration. Making this switch now will make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it will enable you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup makes the transition from the legacy SharePoint setup easy and seamless.

To switch, just open and run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup directly, or open the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page. Follow the setup guide as described in the previous section.

## Restoring OneDrive and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

As part of a disaster recovery exercise, administrators might need to restore a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment to a backup from a time in the past, and synchronize OneDrive storage to that same point in time. OneDrive provides recovery various tools, such as restoring a user’s OneDrive to a previous time, restore a previous version of an individual file, or restore deleted files. For more information, see the following articles:

* For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Restoring an Environment in the Admin Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-backup-restore).
* For OneDrive, see [Restore your OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)

## Governance

The SharePoint admin center provides extensive control over policies that govern the use of OneDrive throughout the organization. Users who have at least the [SharePoint administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) role can set up policies that determine who can access OneDrive, where data resides, the content lifecycle, and much more. The following links provide information about often-used features and settings that may enhance your integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

On the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page, which you open from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal.

Similar functionality exists to reconcile excess amounts on payment reconciliation journal lines on an ad-hoc basis. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments that Can't be Applied Automatically](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

Payments posted based on text-to-account mapping are not applied to open entries, but are merely posted to the specified accounts in addition to creating bank account ledger entries. Accordingly, text-to-account mapping is suited for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. For more information, see the "Example - Text-to-Account Mapping for Fuel Expense" section in this article.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Payments on reconciliation journal lines are only set to posting according to text-to-account mapping if the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**. If the automatic application function provides a match confidence of High, then the payment is automatically applied to one or more open entries, and the payment is not posted to the accounts specified on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. In other words, a match confidence of **High** overrules a text-to-account mapping.

On a payment reconciliation journal line where the payment has been set to posting according to text-to-account mapping, the **Match Confidence** field contains **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**, and the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields contain the mapped accounts.

## To map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
4. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on payments that you want to post to specified accounts without applying to an open entry. You can enter up to 50 characters.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If no other payments exist with the mapping text in question, then the text-to-account mapping will occur even when only a part of the text on the payment exists as a mapping text.
5. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the payments will be posted to.
6. In the **Bal. Source Type** field, specify if the payment will be posted to a general ledger account or to a customer or vendor account.
7. In the **Bal. Source No.** field, specify the account that the payment will be posted to, depending on your selection in the **Bal. Source Type** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not use the **Debit Acc. No.** and **Credit Acc. No.** fields in connection with payment reconciliation. They are used for incoming documents only. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for all text on payments that you want to map to accounts for direct posting without application.

Next time you import a bank statement file or choose the **Apply Automatically** action on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, journal lines for the payments that contain the specified mapping text will contain the mapped accounts in the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields. The **Match Confidence** field will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**. This is on the condition that the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**.

## Example: Text-to-Account mapping for bank fees

To always post expenses that are related to fees from a specific bank, MyBank, to the general ledger account for bank charges and fees (account 60400), fill a line on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page as follows.

| Mapping Text | Debit Acc. No. | Credit Acc. No. | Bal. Source Type | Bal. Source No. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyBank |BLANK |60400|G/L Account |BLANK |

# Analyze data in lists with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use *analysis assist* to help you analyze data on list pages.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About analysis assist

Analysis assist is a Copilot for the [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) on list pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Analysis mode provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. To analyze data in analysis mode, you create an *analysis* tab where you transform the data to display the desired aggregations and summarizations. For example, you arrange fields in rows and columns, specify filters, sort columns, and pivot on fields. With analysis assist, instead of doing this task manually, you achieve much of the same&mdash;or least as a start&mdash;by using words. By expressing the structure you want in natural language, like "sort on quantity from smallest to largest" or "show average cost per category," analysis assist uses AI to generate a suggested layout on an analysis tab.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An administrator must activate the **Analyze list** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page and grand users permissions to use analysis mode. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Get started

1. Open the list page you want to analyze.

   For example, to work with the **Items** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *items*, and then choose the related link.

1. You can start analyzing data with Copilot directly from the list page or by first entering analysis mode. To get started, do one of the following steps:

    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Analyze list**.
    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the enter analysis mode icon](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) **Enter analysis mode**, then select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Create new analysis**.

1. In the **Analyze Items** window, enter a description of the layout you want. This description is known as a *prompt*.

    ![Shows the analysis assist Copilot](media/analysis-assist.svg)

    > [!TIP]
    > For help in writing a prompt, select ![Shows the view prompt icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **Prompt guide**, and choose one of the options to get you started. The text in brackets `[ ]` is shown only as an example and isn't included in the Copilot window.

1. Select **Generate** and then wait while Copilot generates the layout on new analysis tab.
1. Review the results on the new analysis tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you navigate away from the new analysis tab (such as going to another analysis tab or page), the new analysis tab is automatically saved and Copilot closes.

1. If you want to change the generated analysis, you can do one of these steps:

   - To build on the previous instructions, enter the information in the **Add more details about the analysis** box, then select the ![Show the adjust arrow](media/analysis-assist-adjust-button.png) **Adjust** arrow. Copilot remembers your previous instructions and uses them to make adjustments.

     ![Shows the analysis assist history buttons](media/analysis-assist-paging.svg)

   - To manually adjust the layout, you can interact directly with the columns, data area, and analysis filters. For example, you can adjust a filter and remove a column, and Copilot remains available in case you want assistance with building on your manual adjustments and previous instructions.
   - To start from scratch by adding new instructions, select the ![Shows the edit prompt pencil icon](media/edit-pencil.png) **Edit prompt:**, add the details to the prompt, and then select **Generate**.

1. Use **< Back** and **> Next** at the top of the Copilot window to review the different layouts you created as you made adjustments for this analysis tab. You can go back to any adjustments that you or Copilot made to the tab since you created it.

1. If you want to save the analysis tab, select **Keep it**. If you don't want to save it, select **Discard**.

## Prompt tips and examples

Creating effective prompts for Copilot is essential to get accurate and relevant analysis suggestions. There are also ways to minimize text you add in prompts to make it faster when typing. Here are some tips and guidelines followed by some examples:

- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Make sure field names used in prompts are somewhat close to actual field names on the page.
- Use natural language, expressing the data structure you want in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use common keywords, phrases, and terms used in data analysis, like `group by`, `sum`, `sort by`, and so on.
- If the initial response isn't what you want, add follow-up instructions or rephrase the last instruction.
- Common abbreviations are acceptable.
- Letter case isn't important.

### Examples

These following prompt examples use analysis assist on the **Items** list. The items page includes three summable fields for analysis: **Quantity on Hand**, **Unit Cost**, **Unit Price**.

Prompt: `Show low-stock items by category`

This prompt can be used to group item records by their assigned category, filtering items to only those items with low stock. Copilot suggests a definition for low inventory and applies a filter such as "Quantity on Hand less than 10". In this case, the items list doesn't display the **Category** field, Instead, Copilot brings that field into the analysis tab so that you don´t need to go through the manual effort of personalizing the page.

Prompt: `Show items by brand and unit of measure`

This prompt tries to show totals for all summable fields, grouped by brand and the **Base Unit of Measure** field. But in this case, "brand" doesn't match any field name, so Copilot probably can't find a matching field. It then asks you to rephrase the prompt and try again.

Prompt: `Show items by type and uom`

This prompt  shows totals for all summable fields, grouped by the **Type** field and **Base Unit of Measure** field. In this prompt, the abbreviation `uom` is used instead of writing out "unit of measure". Copilot is often able to interpret abbreviations or alternate names and match them to fields on the list.

Prompt: `Show total quantity per type per UoM`

This prompt creates a pivot table on the **Quantity on Hand** field per **Base Unit of Measure** per **Type**.

## How Copilot works with fields for analysis assist

Copilot can use any of the visible or hidden fields on the list page and add them as columns to the analysis tab layout. Hidden fields are those fields that you would typically add to the list by personalizing the page.

When Copilot determines that a hidden field is useful for your analysis tab, the field is shown as a column in the tab layout. It's also shown in the **Columns** pane so that you can hide or reorder it, or add it to any other analysis tabs for this list.  

> [!NOTE]
> If an administrator has turned off personalization for your profile (role), Copilot isn't able to use hidden fields from the list.

Copilot can't reach fields that are on the table but not on the page, and it can't use fields from other pages.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

## Project Analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: view project costing performance

CFOs want to ensure that you aren't overspending on specific projects from a high-level. By analyzing the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against its budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) report to view key information on profit statics per project.

## Project analytics for project managers

To fit this category, you might have a role such as Project Manager.

### Example scenario: tracking project completion and sales

Project managers want to know how each project is performing and get high-level information about them. The [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report can help you compare key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by using either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) reports.

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_sku_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for stock-keeping units.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as am item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_reservations.png" alt-text="Planning with reservations.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The planning system may have consumed the safety stock intentionally and will then replenish it straight away. Learn more at [Consume safety stock](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#consume-safety-stock).

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_error_log.png" alt-text="Error messages in the planning worksheet.":::

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.

# Merge duplicate records

As different users create new customer, vendor, or contact cards over time, or the new records are created automatically during migration, a customer, vendor, or contact may be represented in the system with more than one record. In this case, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and provides functions to select which values to keep or discard when merging two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, a duplicate is indicated by the page showing very few fields. Whereas, if the page shows many fields, then the suspected record is probably not a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor  and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you have opened, indicated in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only, however, if merge conflicts exist, you'll resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field will then be transferred to the current record when you complete the process.
6. When you have finished selecting which values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    The system checks if the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes any conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all usage of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table will be replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge.** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which will appear if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-80.00|-10|2|  

### Value Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|2|3|  

### Item Application Entries (2)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|2|2|1|2|-10|  

At the end of the accounting period, you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to reconcile these inventory transactions with the general ledger.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

 The following tables show the result of reconciling the inventory transactions in this example with the general ledger.  

### Value Entries (3)  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|10.00|1|2|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|-80.00|2|3|  

### General Ledger Entries (3)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|70.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-70.00|2|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|3|  
|01-01-07|[Overhead Applied Account]|7292|-10.00|4|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-80.00|5|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|80.00|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The posting date of the general ledger entries is the same as for the related value entries.  
> 
> The **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the **Value Entry** table is filled.  

 The relation between value entries and general ledger entries is stored in the **G/L - Item Ledger Relation** table.  

### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation table (3)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  
|5|3|1|  
|6|3|1|  

## Assembly and Production Posting

Capacity and resource ledger entries represent the time that is posted as consumed in production or assembly. These process costs are posted as value entries to the general ledger along with the involved material costs in a similar structure as described for item ledger entries in this topic.  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.  

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for late payment prediction

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

# Set up sustainability features

To use the sustainability features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Role Center  

If your primary responsibilities involve sustainability processes, we recommend that you use the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center. It gives easy access to the core features of sustainability, and the finance and procurement processes. It also shows the most important sustainability-related key performance indicators (KPIs).

To configure the Role Center, follow the steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **My settings**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Role** field, select the **Available Roles** page.
3. Choose **Sustainability Manager**.
4. Select **OK**.

## Sustainability setup  

Specify some general settings for sustainability, such as the unit of measure for emissions, the decimal places for amounts, and whether some fields are mandatory.

To configure these settings, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the required fields that are related to sustainability.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register emissions. |
    | **Waste Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the the waste unit of measure code that you use to register waste intensity. |
    | **Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the water unit of measure code that you use to register water intensity. |
    | **Disch. Into Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register discharged into water. |
    | **Emission Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for emission amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, means that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places are shown for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Country/Region Mandatory** | Make the country/region field mandatory. You can set the country/region field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the country/region field before posting. |
    | **Responsibility Center Mandatory** | Make the responsibility center mandatory. The responsibility center can be used as a facility, so that you can measure facility-based emissions. You can set the responsibility center field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the responsibility center field before posting. |
    | **Block Calculation Foundation Change If Ledger Entries Exist** | Prevent changes to the calculation foundation (formula) at the account category level when the formula was already applied to sustainability entries. |
    | **Enable Background Error Check** | Enable validations for sustainability journal lines. The validations run in the background. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you turn on or turn off validations in journals, sign in again before you start the new setup.

3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields that are required to use sustainability features in the purchase process.  

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** | Enable sustainability related fields and features to appear on purchase documents, such as **Sustainability Account** or different emissions. |
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable posting of **Sustainability Value Entries** through value chain operations and the visibility of sustainability related fields in operational documents and journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default **Sustainability Account** on the **G/L Account** card page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item** card page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item Charge** (currently not operating) page. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Specifies the enablement of default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** field makes the **Sustainability Account** and emission fields on purchase documents. However, when you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates **Sustainability Ledger Entries**. To activate posting to the **Sustainability Value Entries** and enable value chain tracking, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field.

4. On the **Calculations** FastTab, configure the required fields for the formulas that calculate emissions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Fuel/Electricity Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for fuel/electricity amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Distance Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for distance measurements. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Custom Amount Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for custom amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |

5. On the **Reporting** FastTab, complete the setup by configuring the fields that are related to reporting to authorities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In version 24.0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support reporting to any authorities. The fields that are related to the configuration of this functionality on the **Reporting** FastTab are intended for future reporting capabilities. However, partners can also use these fields in localized versions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Reporting Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to report emissions. You can use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. This field isn't applicable to the standard reports. |
    | **Reporting UOM Factor** | Enter the unit of measure factor that you use to register emissions, if you use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Precision** | Enter the size of the interval that you use to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Type** | Choose how to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |

## Emission fees

To track internal carbon fees or calculate your emissions using carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, configure the **Emission Fees** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission you want to configure: **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**. This field is mandatory.
3. Specify the **Scope Type**. If you leave this field blank, it applies to all scopes, but you can configure it for each scope.  
4. Specify a **Starting Date** and **Ending Date**. These dates let you use different configurations for different periods.
5. The **Country/Region Code** and **Responsibility Code** are optional fields that you can use if you want to have different carbon fees or carbon equivalent factors per country/region or per facility (responsibility center).
6. The **Carbon Fee** field represents the internal carbon fee that a company charges itself for each unit of CO2 equivalent that it emits. You can use this field based on some local or regional regulations, or for internal calculations. The **Carbon Fee** is calculated every time you post emissions. This information displays on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, without more posting to the **G/L Ledger**. You can set up **Carbon Fee** per unit of measure that you have in the **Sustainability Setup**, and you can fill this field only for the line where the **Emission Type** is **CO2**.
7. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential. If the **Emission Type** is CO2, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always *1* and you can't modify this value because CO2 is the reference gas used for calculating the global warming potential (GWP) of other GHGs. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to *1*. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.
To calculate the carbon equivalent factor, use the following example. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to add is 0.00336.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** isn't calculated based on the **CO2 Emission** values. Instead, as a foundation for this formula, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **CO2e Emission** field. The **CO2e Emission** field is calculated based on all emissions posted to an entry. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is configured for each of the gases on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!TIP]
> To use CO2e for all emissions (*CO2e of CO2*, *CO2e of CH4*, and *CO2e of N2O*), set the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** to **1** for the **CO2**, **CH4**, and **N2O** options. This setting gives you CO2e for all emissions, and the **CO2e** field displays the total carbon equivalent.  

If you didn't configure the **Emission Fees** before you posted sustainability entries, and you want to calculate your carbon fees and CO2e retroactively, run the **Calculate Emission Fees** action to update values on the sustainability ledger entries.  

## Responsibility Center

Use the **Responsibility Center** to post entries related to sustainability, where it represents a specific facility. However, if you want to use water management in sustainability, configure some additional information. You can set up your responsibility center as usual, and fill in the fields on the **Sustainability** FastTab as described in the following table.  

| Field | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Water Capacity Dimension** | Specifies the capacity dimension. For example, Area or Volume. |
| **Water Capacity Quantity (Month)** | Indicates the total water capacity quantity of the responsibility center. |
| **Water Capacity Unit** | Specifies the unit of measure that describes capacity quantity. |

# Design Details: Item Tracking in the Warehouse
Serial number and lot number handling is primarily a warehouse task and therefore all inbound and outbound warehouse documents have standard functionality for assigning and selecting item tracking numbers.  

However, because the reservation system is based on item ledger entries, warehouse activity documents that register only warehouse entries are not fully supported. Because reservations and item tracking numbers can be handled only at the location level, not at the bin and zone level, the **Item Tracking Lines** page cannot be opened from warehouse activity documents. The same applies to the **Reservation** page.  

After a serial or lot number has been added to an item at a warehouse location, it can be moved and reclassified freely within the warehouse by using an independent item tracking structure that is unrelated to the reservation system. **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are accessed directly on warehouse document lines. When the serial or lot number later partakes in outbound posting, it is synchronized with the reservation system as a part of ordinary bin adjustment. For more information, see [Design Details: Integration with Inventory](design-details-integration-with-inventory.md).  

However, the reservation system does take warehouse activities into consideration when it calculates availability. For example, items that are allocated to picks, or registered as picked, cannot be reserved. For more information, see [Design Details: Warehouse Availability](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

# (Obsolete) Set the Layout Used by a Report

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

A report can be set up with more than one report layout, which you can then switch among as needed.

Depending on the layouts that are available for a report, you can choose to use a built-in RDLC report layout, a built-in Word report layout, or a custom layout. For more information about RDLC and Word report layouts, built-in and custom layouts, and more, see [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When custom report layouts are defined, you can select them from customer and vendor cards to specify that the selected layouts will be used for documents that you crate for the customer or vendor in question. For more information, see [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

> [!TIP]  
> Document reports (not lists) that use a Word report layout are typically faster than those that use an RDLC report layout. So if you have the option to choose between a Word or RDLC report layout for a document report, use the Word report layout for the best performance.

## To change which report layout to use for a report or document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** <!-- **Selected Layout** -->field specifies the layout that's currently used on the report.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top the company that includes the report.

   This field let's you set a different layouts for same report report in different companies.

3. To change the layout that is used by a report, on the row for the report, set the **Selected Layout** field to one of the following options:
   * **RDLC (built-in)**, uses the built-in RDLC report layout on the report.
   * **Word (built-in)**, uses the built-in Word report layout on the report.
   * **Custom**, uses a custom layout on the report.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose a report layout of type **RDLC (built-in)** or **Word (built-in)** and you get an error message that the report does not have a layout of the specified type, then you must choose another layout option or create a custom report layout of the type that you want to use. See the next procedure.

If you selected a built-in RDLC or Word report layout, then no further action is required, and the layout will be used the next time the report is run.

## To change the custom layout to use for a report layout

You may also want to change the currently used custom layout. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

All custom report layouts that exist for report layouts in a company are listed on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. On the **Report Layout Selection** page, you can see which custom layouts are available for each report in the **Custom Layouts** FactBox.

1. On the **Report Layout Selection** page, on the line for the report layout that you want to change, choose the lookup button in the **Custom Layout Description** field.
2. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the row for the custom layout that you want to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

The name of the selected custom layout is now shown in the **Custom Layout Description** field and will be used the next time the report or document is previewed, printed, or sent.

You can now go to your customer and vendor cards to specify which of the layouts to use for different documents that you crate for the customer or vendor in question, such as order confirmations or payment reminders. For more information, see [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

# Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [General](#tab/general)

### How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you use it, when you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat, or choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you might have to enter the credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

To sign out of the identity in Teams you used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, then choose **Settings**. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**.

### Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;such as on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. To search for contacts in a different company, go to [Settings](across-teams-settings.md). When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record to the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organization and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace.

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app works with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether offered by Microsoft or a partner.  Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (learn more in [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |
|-|----|--------------| 
|Message author |Displays in the language that's specified for you in Teams. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't offer that same language, the card is displayed in English. |Displayed in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which might include languages from language apps provided by partners. |
|Message recipient |Displays in the language of the message author. |Displays in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. |

Get a list of supported languages for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#supported-languages).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with industry solutions?

Yes. But only some features of the app work with Embed apps:

- The app works with links based on the **\*.bc.dynamics.com** pattern that's typically used with Embed apps.
- Contact search isn't available for Embed apps that replace the base application from Microsoft.

Learn more about emdeb apps in [Embed apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview).

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can only view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. You can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages or searching for contacts. Learn more about minimum requirements for mobile in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android?

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaboration within Teams. Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. Learn more about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps in:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams Mobile App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) in Microsoft Support

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On those platforms, use a supported browser to access Teams.

Learn more about minimum requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

Learn more about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them at [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that might affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app.
- Phone numbers can't be activated from the details window in Teams for iOS, Android, or in the browser.
- Using Microsoft Edge with Teams in the browser lets you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. Learn more about using profiles in Microsoft Edge at [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) in Microsoft Support.

### What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organization, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organization that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater to my customization and personalization?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables from your own custom extensions or AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customizations installed for your organization. Cards don't consider any role-specific customizations or user personalization. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including extensions, role customizations, and user personalization.

When you search for contacts, the fields matched in the **Contacts** table and fields shown in the search results aren't affected by any customization or personalization.

### How do the permissions required by the app affect my privacy?

Before installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can review the minimum permissions required for the app to function. By installing the app, you give the app permission to receive the messages and data you provide to it and you give Teams permission to store and process those messages.

Also, some [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features require opening external links or access to your camera or geographic location. So suppose you wanted to capture a photo of a purchase invoice for processing. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't use these capabilities without your consent and they're only used by specific features in the **Details** window. When you use one of these features for the first time, Teams displays a dialog box asking you to grant access to the required device capabilities.

- In Teams desktop, you review and adjust app permissions from the **Settings** window. Select your profile picture at the top of the app, select **Settings** > **Permissions**, then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

- For Teams in the browser and Teams for iOS or Android, you can review or adjust permissions from your browser or device settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Exactly which [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features prompt you for permissions depends on the add-on apps and customizations applied to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you connect to.

### Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organization handles the privacy of your data.

### How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon, and select **Uninstall**.  

### Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/).

If you want to participate in improving the app for Teams, or have an idea that would help simplify your work or collaborative experiences in Teams, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

### Where can I find Teams integration inside the Business Central web client? 

To learn about the functionality in the web client that links to Teams, see [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

## [Business Central Tabs](#tab/tabs)

### <a name="who-can-view"></a>Who can see the content of a tab?

Any person in your chat or channel who has:

1. The Business Central app for Teams installed.
2. Either a Business Central license or has been granted access to Business Central using their Microsoft 365 license.
3. Permissions to view the data on the page.

### <a name=#recommended-content></a>Where does the recommended content come from?

The recommended content that you can choose from in the **Tab content** option on a tab is based on your Role Center. The recommend content only includes list pages, like Customers, Sales Orders, and Vendors - not individuals card page alike a specific customer or vendor.

Specifically, the recommended content includes:

- Actions in the top navigation menu of the role center
- Any list pages you've bookmarked.
- If a list page offers different views, including any views you created, you also get to choose from those views

You can add list pages to the recommended content by adding bookmarks. You can also remove recommended content by deleting bookmarks. Learn more in [Bookmark a Page or Report on Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

If you switch the environment or company on the tab option, the recommended content will changed based on the Role Center and bookmarks for the environment and company you switch to.

### When I create a tab, does it grant permissions to the people in the channel or chat?

No. Creating tabs doesn't affect permissions, and users must already have permission to that data when they access the tab.

### Can I chat alongside a tab?

Yes. Use the chat icon to start the conversation. This chat thread is then associated with the tab. 

### If I remove a tab from a chat or channel, is any Business Central data deleted?

No.

### Can I safely rename a tab?

Yes. The contents of the tab are unrelated to the actual name of the tab. Rename at will! 

### I need to work across tasks in different windows. Can I do this?

Yes. You can pop out the tab to its own browser window to show the Business Central web client. 

### Can I add or pin tab in Team meetings?

No. The Business Central app for Teams doesn't support tabs in meetings.

### Can't add a tab if using ISV Urls like *.bc.dynamics.com (but can pin)

Not supported.

### When I do things in the tab, like navigate, resort, apply a filter, or search, do others see my changes?

No. Only field changes or running actions affect how others see the contents of the tab.

### Does the tab content refresh automatically? If not, how do I refresh it?

The content doesn't refresh automatically, and these currently no refresh button. The best way to refresh the content to make sure it's up to data, leave the tab and then come back. 

### Does this show lists and records from my customizations and add-ons?

Yes. 

### When I add a tab, will people see it in my language?

No. Each user views the tab contents in the language, region, and timezone settings from Business Central. 

### Can I have multiple tabs pointing to different content?

Yes.

### Can I also add tabs to chat with a single person?

Yes, as long as the chat isn't a draft (that is, a message hasn't been sent to initiate that chat) and the other person has the Business Central app installed too.

### Can I switch companies within a tab?

No.

### Is this different than using Teams' generic ability to create a tab that hosts a website?

Yes. We don't recommend that you use approach. In many cases, it doesn't work for Business Central.

## [Search for Contacts](#tab/contacts)

### Which tables does the app search in?

When searching for contacts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, your search terms are matched against records in the **Contacts** table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### Which fields in the contacts table can I search?

As you type your search terms in the search box, the terms are matched against most fields in the **Contacts** table. The fields include, for example, the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **Phone No.** or **Mobile Phone No.**, and **Email** fields. 

Search terms aren't matched against any custom fields added to the **Contacts** table by apps and extensions.

### Do search results include companies and persons?

Yes. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], contacts can be of type **Company** or type **Person**, where one or more persons can be associated with a company. In the search results, companies and persons have different icons.

### Do contacts of any business relationship appear in the results?

Yes. Some contacts can represent customers or vendors, or both. Other contacts with no defined business relation typically represent prospective customers. Contacts with other business relations, including any custom relations you've configured in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], will also be displayed in the search results.

### Can I look up contact details during meetings?

Yes. You can look up contact information, history of interaction, and related documents for your customer or vendor during a Teams meeting or call while the meeting is happening, without leaving Teams.

In fact, you can look up contact details from anywhere in Teams by using the **Search** box. You can, for example, look up contact details from the Teams calendar to help you set up meetings.

### How do I view my last interactions with a contact?

The details window for a contact displays interaction log entries. The interaction log entries provide the history of interactions that your organization has had with the specific contact. The interactions can include emails you've exchanged, calls you've received, or documents you've sent.

For interactions to be displayed, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] must be configured to track interactions. To learn more about logging interactions, see [Record Interactions With Contacts](marketing-interactions.md).

### How do I register a Teams call or meeting as an interaction?

From the details window for a contact, find the **Create Interaction** action, and choose from the incoming or outgoing calls as interaction templates. You can also create your own custom interaction templates specifically for use with Teams conversations.

### Can I call a contact from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] has limited integration to Teams calling capabilities. It isn't possible to instantly start a VOIP call from the contact card or contact details window. However, when you view the contact details in the Teams desktop app, you can select the phone number field to dial that number if Teams is set up as your default dialing app on your device. To dial landlines or mobile phone numbers using PSTN, the traditional phone system, Teams requires that you have the Microsoft 365 Business Voice app. To learn more, see [What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?](/MicrosoftTeams/business-voice/whats-business-voice).

### How do I view recent documents for a customer or vendor?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] typically relates a contact with a customer or vendor record that in turn is related to business transaction records, such as sales quotes or purchase invoices. To view related documents for a contact, go to the details window for the contact, select the **Business Relation** field value or use the actions to navigate to the associated customer or vendor. On the customer or vendor page, expand the FactBox pane to reveal statistics for various documents that you can drill down into. Your experience can differ based on your customizations and personalization.

### How do I search for contacts using special characters?

You can enter search criteria using almost any unicode characters. However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves the following symbols for other uses: **=**, **.**, **\***, and **@**. Using these symbols in your search terms might not return the expected results. If you don't see the expected results, enclose the symbols in your search terms in single quotes, for example, **Contoso'='2**.

### How can I search contacts stored in a different company?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can search for customers, vendors, and other contacts in one company at a time.  
To search for contacts stored in a different [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, open [Settings](across-teams-settings.md), then change the environment and company from there.

### Are [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts different than the ones in the Teams contacts screen?

Yes. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] represent business contacts available to your organization. They're contacts with which you have an established and well-defined business relationship, or contacts that represent prospective customers. These contacts are typically external contacts. In comparison, the contacts shown in the Teams Calling contacts list are your own contacts. These contacts aren't necessarily shared with others in your organization, and they typically represent contacts internal to your organization.

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize contacts with Teams?

No. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] remain separate from your contacts stored in Teams. There are currently no plans to synchronize the two lists together. When you use the Teams feature **Share someone's contact info** from the chat compose box, it has no relation to Business Central contacts.

### Can I search from my mobile device?

Contact search isn't available from Teams for iOS and Teams for Android at this time.

### Which permissions do I need for contact search?

To search for contacts, you need object-level permission to the **Contacts** table within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company being searched. To view the details window for a contact, you need at least read permission to the **Contact** page within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, and any other related objects.

### Can I use contact search if I'm a delegated admin?

Yes. You can also look up contacts and contact details if you have a delegated admin role in an organization.

### Is contact search affected by API limits?

Yes. Searching for contacts from Teams is based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] v2.0 APIs and subject to any API limits that manage usage. Learn more about the limits in [Current API Limits](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-current-limits).

### Why does it sometimes ask me to set up the app?

After you sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams for the first time, the app will attempt to determine your preferred company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the app can't determine the company, you might have to go to the **Settings** and choose the company you wish to search in. This situation happens, for example, if you have access to multiple companies across environments in your organization. In this case, you'll have to choose a company before you can start searching.  

The app can also ask you to visit the **Settings** if you don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription, there are no [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, or your account doesn't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### I'd like to search for items or records from other tables. Can I do this from Teams?

Searching in other tables isn't possible at this time. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams searches only in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts list, which can include vendors, customers, and other contacts.

If you'd like to see the search capabilities evolve to include other tables, we encourage our community to add an idea or vote for existing ideas at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas.

## [Work with cards](#tab/cards)

### Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Zip codes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I delete a card I sent to a chat?

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator might have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### Why don't cards show more information instead of just the page name and details button?

An administrator might have configured the Teams integration so that cards don't show data about records. For more information, see [Show or hide record data on cards](admin-teams-integration.md#show-or-hide-record-data-on-cards).

### Will others see my card if they don't have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card&mdash;even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

### How do I find out which company a card in Teams belongs to?

If you work across [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, talk to your administrator about enabling a company badge for each company. When enabled, this eye-catching hint appears in any details window inside Teams, and displays the company and environment that record belongs to. To learn how to set up company badge, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).

## [Work with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### Where is the save button in the details window in Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialog within the details window, you might need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window?

No. While everyone in the chat or meeting can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams?

Yes. If you're using the Teams desktop app, start a call by choosing the linked number in a phone number field, like the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones, Teams requires that you have a Business Voice license for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### Can I print documents from the details window in Teams?

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams?

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you're using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app.

### How do I open the details in a new window?

Popping out the details window as a separate window is useful for multi-tasking or for being able to work with business data while still being able to use Teams chat and other Teams functions. To open details in its own window, choose **Open in browser** from the ellipse menu (**...**) in the upper right corner of the window.

## [Collaborate with guests](#tab/collaborating)

### Can I share cards with users outside my organization?

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organization. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organization to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organization. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details page if they have permission to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license within your organization.

Choosing the details link on any Business Central card will sign you in to the environment from which the card was shared, assuming you have permission to the environment.

Guest users aren't allowed to use contact search because it's bound to the original tenant and we don't currently support such a delegated scenario.

When a guest composes a message, links to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] or yours won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, go to [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organization's policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organization. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [Share to Teams](#tab/share)

### Does Share to Teams send a compact card? 

Yes. The link will automatically expand into a card if you have the Business Central app for Teams installed. 

### Will recipients receive the message from me or from a Business Central service account? 

When you use Share to Teams, the message is sent to a person, group, or channel, similar to if you had sent the message yourself from within Microsoft Teams. Recipients see the message from you on their preferred Teams client, and can react and respond as they normally would to a message from you. 

### Is Share to Teams available in Business Central on premises? 

No. Similar to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, this feature is only available for the web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does Share to Teams grant permissions to recipients? 

No. When you share with a person, group, or channel, permissions are unaffected. Users who already have permission to view the page and data targeted by the link can do so. Users who don't have permission to view that page and data, or don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license, are shown an error message. 
 
### Must I have the Teams desktop app installed to use Share to Teams? 

No. All you need is a valid account that has access to Microsoft Teams. 

### Is Share to Teams available in all Business Central clients? 

At this time, Share to Teams is available in the desktop web client, in the details window in Teams, and when opening a page in a new window from the Outlook add-in.

### Where do I find Share to Teams in Business Central? 

The **Share to Teams action** can be found in the **Share** menu on all pages, such as card and document pages, list or worksheet pages, including custom pages. The action isn't available on dialog boxes or pages shown as dialog boxes, such as lookup pages or wizards.

# Financial Reporting frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Financial Reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## New report, row, or column definitions aren't available after an upgrade. How do I get access to them?

Financial report, row, and column definitions are stored as data in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. To make sure your definitions aren't overwritten or changed during upgrade, new definitions are only available in new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants.

To make new report, row, or column definitions available in existing companies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new tenant.
1. Export the definitions you would like as configuration packages.
1. Sign in to your tenant, and switch to the company where you want the new definitions.
1. Import the configuration packages with the new definitions.

To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).

## Why don't the numbers in my report balance with the general ledger?

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance with the general ledger. To learn more about possible reasons and ways to fix these issues, go to [Balancing reports to the general ledger](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger).

## How can I test my report?

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. To learn more, go to [Adding check figures](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#adding-check-figures).

## When should I use net change vs. balance at date?

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports. To learn more, go to [When to use net change or balance at date](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-net-change-or-balance-at-date).

## Which users can run or modify financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Permissions to view or edit financial reports](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#permissions-to-view-or-edit-financial-reports).

## How can I setup auditing on changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#set-up-the-change-log-for-financial-report-definitions).

## How can I get notified when financial report definitions change?

To learn more, go to [Get notified when financial report definitions change](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#get-notified-when-financial-report-definitions-change).

## How can I analyze changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-financial-report-definitions).

# Process Sales Opportunities

After you create an opportunity, there are several features for managing the opportunity and moving it through to completion.

## View opportunities

Existing sale opportunities are available on the **Opportunity List** page. The following table describes ways to access the page to process sales opportunities.

| To view opportunities for | Then |
| --- | --- |
| All salespeople and contacts |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunity List**, and then choose the related link. |
| A specific sales person |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link. Select the salesperson, choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose the **List** action. |
| A specific contact |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link. Select the contact from the list, and then choose the **Opportunities** action. |

Each of these tasks opens the **Opportunity List** page.

## Close opportunities

You can close opportunities when the negotiations are over. When you close an opportunity, you can specify whether it was won or lost, and the reasons for closing it. To specify a reason, you must set up closed opportunity codes.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and the choose the **Close** action. The **Close Opportunity** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

   The **Close Opportunity Code** and **Date Closed** fields are required fields and must be filled in before you can choose the **OK** button.

   In the **Close Opportunity Code** field, you can choose from one of the existing close opportunity codes or add a new code. To add a new code, from the drop-down list, choose **Select from full list**, and then choose **new**. On the new blank line, fill in the **Code**, **Type**, and **Description** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Create quotes for opportunities

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sales quotes from opportunities where the contact type is Company.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.

## Create sales orders for opportunities

You can make sales orders from the sales quotes that you have created for your opportunities. Before you can create sales orders for your contacts, you must create the contact as a customer. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, find the opportunity that you have created a sales quote for.
2. Choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens to show the sales quote that you have assigned to the opportunity.
3. Fill in the additional fields, and then choose the **Make Order** action.

When handling sales opportunities, you may need to create a quote for the contact that the opportunity is linked to.

## Delete opportunities

You can delete opportunities, for example, after you conclude a deal. However, you can only delete closed opportunities. There are two ways to delete closed opportunities. You can delete individual closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page or you can run the **Delete Opportunities** batch job to delete multiple opportunities based on specified criteria.

To delete closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Delete** action.

To delete closed opportunities by using the **Delete Opportunities** batch job, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Administration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Delete Opportunities** action, and then set the filters that specify the closed opportunities to delete.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

After you delete an opportunity, it's removed it from the **Opportunity List** page.

## Move an opportunity through sales cycle stages

If an opportunity follows a sales cycle, you can move it to the next or previous stage, and even skip a stage.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, choose the **Update** action. The **Update Opportunity** opens,
2. Use the **Action Type** field to move the opportunity through the sales cycle stages:
   * **Next** moves the opportunity forward one stage.
   * **Skip** moves the opportunity forward one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field. You can only skip stages that have been set up to allow skipping.
   * **Previous** moves the opportunity back one stage.
   * **Jump** moves the opportunity back one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field.
   * **Update** enables you to change information (such as to modify your evaluation of their chances of success and estimated values) without moving to another stage.
3. Fill in the other fields as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Set up digital vouchers

Administrators can use digital voucher functionality to require that documents are attached to specific transactions when they're posted. Therefore, this functionality allows for a source-driven approach and provides a better audit trail. Different types of enforcement can be configured for this purpose, depending on the documents or journal types.

The term *digital voucher* refers to a digital or electronic form of a traditional voucher in accounting. A voucher is a document that's used to support and authorize financial transactions. For accountants, vouchers typically serve as evidence of an expenditure or a receipt of funds. The voucher might include details such as the date of the transaction, a description, the amount, and any authorization signatures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some countries and regions might have legal requirements for specific setups, which might restrict you from configuring some options. If you encounter these restrictions, look for a detailed explanation on the documentation page for your country or region.

## Enable digital vouchers

Follow these steps to enable digital voucher functionality.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Set up digital vouchers

You can use different setups for the documents and journals described in the following table.

| Entry type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Sales Document | Specifies postings that are completed from sales documents. |
| Purchase Document | Specifies postings that are completed from purchase documents. |
| General Journal | Specifies postings that are completed from the general journal for all account types, except types related to customers and vendors. If you select one of those account types, you change control of the posting process. If you select **Customer** as the account type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup for sales journals. If you select **Vendor** as the account type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup for purchase journals. |
| Sales Journal | Specifies the postings that are completed from the sales journal and the general journal where **Customer** is selected as the account type. |
| Purchase Journal | Specifies the postings that are completed from the purchase journal and the general journal where **Vendor** is selected as the account type. |

Follow these steps to define how your organization uses enforced digital vouchers.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Entry Setup**, and then select the related link. Alternatively, on the **Digital Voucher Setup** page, select **Entry Setup**.
2. In the **Entry Type** column, select an option.
3. In the **Check Type** column, select an enforcement option. If you select **None**, you can post the selected type of entry without a digital voucher. If you select **Attachment**, the entry must include an attachment. If you select **Attachment or Note**, you can include an attachment or a note for the entry. 
4. Select the **Generate Automatically** checkbox to generate the digital voucher automatically. For example, if you don't want to manually add a sales invoice to your transaction, select this checkbox. Then, you just have to post the document. The system automatically creates the document, based on your report layout, and attaches it to the transaction.
5. Select the **Skip If Manually Added** checkbox if you don't want to add an automatically generated digital voucher if the user already added a manual attachment.

### Use source codes for setup

To use enforcement for journals, but not for all transaction types, connect the specific source code to identify the entry type in the general journal, sales journal, or purchase journal.

Follow these steps to set up specific source codes for digital vouchers.

1. On the **Digital Voucher Entry Setup** page, select **Source Codes**.
2. On the **Voucher Entry Source Codes** page, select the source codes that you want to configure.
3. Close the page.

## Use the functionality

Open a purchase or sales document, and enter information in the required fields. Before you post the document, you must follow these steps to attach a digital voucher.

1. In the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox, select **Attach File**.
2. Drag a file directly onto the **Insert File** page, or browse to the file from this page.

The document is attached to the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox. For each line, you can find the document name and type.

If you accidentally attach the wrong voucher, follow these steps to delete it before you post the document.

1. In the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox from the document line, select **Incoming Document**.
2. On the **Incoming document** page, select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> If attachment of a digital voucher is configured as mandatory, and you try to post documents or journals without attaching a voucher, the system prevents you from posting. You receive the following error message: "Not possible to post without attaching the digital voucher."

### Find attached vouchers in transactions

You can find the attached voucher from the posted document or from the **General Ledger Entries** page by looking in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

You can't delete an attached document after posting is completed. However, you can add more attachments after posting is completed.

### Use digital vouchers with recurring journals

To use enforced digital vouchers with general recurring journals, follow these steps to ensure that your setup works as you expect.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then select the related link.  
2. To remove the link between the incoming document and the journal when you post the journal, select the **Unlink Incoming Documents On Posting** checkbox for the template. If you don't select this checkbox, digital vouchers stay linked to journal lines after you post them.

# Company information overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] organizes business entities in *companies*. For each company, you must fill in some of the basic company details and relevant information on the **Company Information** page. The information on the [**Company Information**](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1) page is used in documents, such as invoice headers. You can set up more than one company, such as a parent company and a subsidiary.  

If the company's inventory warehouse is located at a different address than the company headquarters, you can complete the various ship-to fields and the **Location Code** field on the **Shipping** FastTab. The information in these fields is then printed on purchase orders, for example, so vendors ship items to the correct location.  

For each company you set up, you must fill in the **Company Information** page, together with the **General Ledger Setup** page. You must also set up each area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, for each company. Learn more at [Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

The **Company Information** page contains different fields and FastTabs, depending on your country/region. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes the most common FastTabs.

[!INCLUDE [admin-company-info-fasttabs](includes/admin-company-info-fasttabs.md)]

After you fill in the information, you can close the page.  

## Working with multiple companies

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes multiple companies, your users might want to use *company badges* to help them quickly identify and keep track of which company they're currently working in. For more information, see [Display a company badge](#badge).

There are a few features you can use to switch among companies as you work, like the company switcher (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>). Learn more at [Switch to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

## <a name="badge"></a>Display a company badge

When there's more than one company or environment, the company switcher shows on the upper-right side of the app bar near the search icon. By default, the company switcher uses a standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments").

:::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/company-switch-2.png" alt-text="Shows the company switcher icon in the heading of the Business Central client.":::  

Starting in 2023 release wave 2, version 23, the company badge appears in the browser tab when using the web client. It's also in page links that you [copy and paste](across-share-data-features.md#copying-a-link) in rich text editors, like Word, Outlook, and Teams.

The following video shows how to work with company badges.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fefe2ce4-d700-4e04-b319-b8557e75dfe9]
 
### Set the company badge

On the **Company Information** page, you can replace the standard company icon with a custom badge on a per-company basis. A company badge can make it easier to identify the company you're working in.

1. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
2. When done, refresh the browser (select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>) to update the badge in the client.  

> [!TIP]
> A company badge also indicates the type of environment the company is in. A round company badge signifies a production environment, and a square badge signifies a sandbox environment.

## Change company display name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

## Experience

The default user experience in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial doesn't reveal all capabilities. You can switch on the full experience on the **Company Information** page.  

For more information, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). ATo use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column. 
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new entry.
7. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Table ID** value (for **Intrastat Report Line**, choose **4812**), and enter the following field information:

   1. In the **Key Index** field, specify the key index to sort the source records before export.
   2. In the **Mapping Codeunit** field, select a value.

8. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, add the columns that you previously configured on the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and then add the following field information:

   1. Specify the **Field ID** value for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** value for each column as needed. The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have developed custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

    | **Conversion Factor** | Specifies the conversion factor for the tariff number. |
    | **Unit of Measure** | Specifies the unit of measure for the tariff number. |

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a supplementary unit of measure, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks whether you want to update related items. If you choose to update related items, the **Unit of Measure** value on the **Item Units of Measure** page is updated for all items that have the same tariff number.
>
> When you add a tariff number that has a defined **Unit of Measure** value to the item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically adds a new unit of measure to the **Item Units of Measure** value for the item. The **Qty. per Unit of Measure** value is based on the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field.

## Automate the process of inheriting the country of origin for items

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to transfer the country of origin from the purchase document to the sales invoice, you must use item tracking lines. Otherwise, the system won't use the default value.

The sections that follow describe how to set up the transfer.

### Intrastat report

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Intrastat Report Setup** in the **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** field, choose the **Purchase Headers** option.  

### Item  

You must enable item tracking for these items, either serial numbers, lots, or both. To enable item tracking for the item, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the item that you want to configure.
3. On the **Item Card** page, on the **Item Tracking** FastTab, select one of item tracking codes using the **Item Tracking Code** field.
4. When you make a selection, you can see how the item tracking codes are configured.
5. Select the code you want, and select **OK**.

### Use the item in purchase documents

After you select an item that has item tracking enabled on the purchase line, follow these steps.  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and run the **Item Tracking Lines** action.
2. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page after adding **Serial No.** or **Lot No.**, and entering value in **Quantity (Base)** field, choose one of the following options:  
   1. The **Lot No. Information Card** action if you're using lots.   
   2. The **Serial No. Information Card** action if you're using serial numbers.  
3. You can choose **New** (**+**) to create new lot or serial numbers on the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages. 
4. The **Country/Region Code** is populated with the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. You can change it if you want.
5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Reporting** FastTab, check whether **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** is selected. If it is, two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values are configured.
3. Verify that the **Zip File(-s)** field is selected, to ensure that report files are added to the zip file.

The process of working with Intrastat reports is the same as the global feature.

<!-- ### Belgium-->

### Czech Republic

The new Intrastat report experience for the Czech Republic is available in 2023 release wave 1. In the meantime, continue to use the **Intrastat Journal** feature.

### Finland

In Finland, there are a few more steps to set up Intrastat. Intrastat reporting in Finland requires two different files for receipts and shipments. There are also two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Report Setup** page, on the **File Setup** FastTab, enter the field information as described in the following table.

    |                 Field              |            Description                |  
    |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | **Custom Code** | Specifies a custom code for the Intrastat file setup information. |
    | **Company Serial No.** | Specifies a company serial number for the Intrastat file setup information. |

3. On the **Reporting** FastTab, check whether **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** is selected.

The process of working with Intrastat Reports is the same as the global feature.

<!-- ### Germany-->

# Manage Access to Business Central

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article gives administrators and application developers a high-level overview of how to control access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and its features. Use the links to go to other articles that provide more details about the subjects.

## Layered access

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses a layered approach to application security, as outlined in the following diagram. To learn more about each layer, go to [Application Security in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-application).

:::image type="content" source="media/security-overview.png" alt-text="Layered application security in Business Central.":::

## Licenses

Assign [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users to a **Dynamics 365 Business Central** license so they can view, modify, and act on their business data from any user interface. To learn more about licenses, go to [Licensing in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/licensing).

However, folks who occasionally need read-only access to information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can use a **Microsoft 365** license. To learn more about giving limited access, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

For comprehensive information about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [download the Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

## Business Central administrator tasks

The following table lists how administrators can control access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the features people will use. Some of the tasks also help keep access settings up to date.

|Task| Learn more |
|--|--|--|
|Each person must have a user account before they can sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The easiest way to set up users is to add them one at a time in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339). |[Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users)|
|Manage access for all users at the environment level. Create a Microsoft Entra security group and assign it to the environment.<br><br> You can also use security groups to manage access for specific groups of users. | [Manage Access to Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access)<br><br>[Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups](ui-security-groups.md) |
|Create users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and define who can sign in. | [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md) |
|In combination with user licenses, permissions define the objects that a user can access within each database or environment. Specify whether people can read, modify, or enter data in database objects. |[Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md)|
|If an external accountant manages your books and financial reporting, invite them to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They'll be able to work more closely with you on your fiscal data.|[Accountant Experiences in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]](finance-accounting.md)|
|If you're a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner, you can send an email to a customer to request a reseller relationship. You can include delegated administration privileges for Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 in the email.| [Delegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin)|
|An Azure service tag represents a group of IP addresses that traffic for a service can come from or go to. Use service tags to set up firewalls to allow traffic only from certain services. The **Dynamics365BusinessCentral** tag lets you use firewall and network security group rules to restrict traffic to and from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].| [Azure security service tags](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-service-tags)|
|When using Microsoft Entra authentication with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], we recommend you take advantage of [Microsoft Entra ID Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks). MFA further safeguards access to the application and data.|[Multi-Factor Authentication for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/multifactor-authentication)|

## Business Central developer tasks

There's also a developer story for managing access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, developers and administrators can build and connect applications to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that benefit the business:  

* Streamline business processes
* Improve customer interactions
* Make better decisions, faster

# Create Segments
You can create segments to select a group of contacts, for example, if you want to create an interaction involving several contacts, such as direct mail.

## To create a segment
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **General** section, in the **No.** field, enter a number for the segment.

    Alternatively, if you have set up number series for segments on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available segment number.
4. Fill in the other fields on the header.

You can now add contacts to the segment. For more information, see [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

# Need more time to decide whether to subscribe?

It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation, you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You can't extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again, which is also a one-time thing. If you aren't already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

## To extend your trial period

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).

    Sign in with the email account that you used when you signed up for the trial.  

    If you signed up with an email account from a [30-day trial of Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/commerce/sign-up-for-office-365-trial), then you must first extend your Microsoft 365 trial, or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription. For more information, see [Extend your trial for Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/extend-your-trial).
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.

    If you dismissed the notification, you must sign out and then sign in again.

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the notification, you can force [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to run the **Extend Trial** assisted setup guide by adding the ```?page=1828``` parameter to the URL, such as in the following example: [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828)

## What happens if my trial period is expired?

If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification.  

After you create your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company.  

If your organization has a reseller relationship with a partner, they can sign in to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a delegated administrator and run the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. For more information, see [Extending trials (as an administrator)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration#extending-trials).  

However, after this second extension gives your organization up to 90 days of trial, you must either subscribe to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or stop using it. If you decide to not continue, we recommend that you export any data that you rely on in your business.

When your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. 90 days after the extended trial expires, we'll delete your company and data unless you subscribe.

# Record payments and refunds in the payment journal

On the **Payment Journals** page, you record payments that you make to vendors and refunds that you make to customers. When you post a payment journal line, the paid amount is recorded on the specified bank account. You must then take steps to perform the actual money transfer from the related bank account.  

Payment journals are general journals that are optimized for making payments. You can quickly add lines manually, you can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggest vendor payments, and you can apply the payment to posted documents. Although you're making payments, you enter a positive amount in the **Document Amount** field. Depending on the document type for the journal line, this amount is then converted to a negative amount in the underlying transactions. This way, it's faster for you to add journal lines manually. If you prefer to enter negative amounts, you can personalize the payment journal to show the **Amount** field instead. To learn more about personalizing pages, go to [Start personalizing by using the personalization mode](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).  

- Applying payments to invoices or credit memos

    If you fill in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field with the invoice or credit memo to pay or refund, the document is set to **Paid** when you post the journal. This setting is referred to as "applied." As an alternative to applying when you post a payment, you can use the **Apply Vendor Entries** and **Apply Customer Entries** pages after you post the payment. To learn more, go to, for example, [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

- Get suggested payments to vendors or employees

    The **Suggest Vendor Payments** and **Suggest Employee Payments** actions can help you fill in payment journal lines automatically according to vendor prioritization and due dates. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md). With this function, the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field is always filled in.  

- Print checks and submit payments electronically to your bank

    In addition to recording that the payment is made, you can also use the **Payment Journal** page to output the payment for further processing by your bank. To learn more, go to [Make Check Payments](payables-how-work-checks.md) and [Make Electronic Payments](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

## To make payments in the payment journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal batch that you use for payments.
3. If you know who to pay, fill in the fields manually. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To also apply the payment to the related invoice or credit memo, choose the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, on the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the relevant invoice or credit memo, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Many fields, such as the **Document Amount** and **Due Date** fields, now contain information from the selected document.
5. Alternatively, use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action. All the applies-to information and amounts are also entered on the journal lines. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).
6. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post** action.

## To issue a refund check

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Document Type** field, select **Refund**.  
3. In the **External Document No.** field, enter a reference for the refund check (for example, the return order number).  
4. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.  
5. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer's account number that the refund check is being issued to.  
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be refunded.  
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.  
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account the check comes out of.  
9. In the **Applies To Doc. No.** field, select the documents that require a refund.  
10. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post/Print** action, choose the **Post and Print** action, and then choose **Yes**.

title: Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations
description: This topic talks about item tracking and reservations, and describes the concepts behind the two options.

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Walkthrough: Calculating work in process for a project

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

For projects, you can schedule the use of company resources and track their associated costs. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you should track as a project progresses. If a project runs over a long period, you might want to transfer its costs to a Work in Process (WIP) account on the balance sheet. You can then recognize the costs and sales in your income statement accounts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Calculate WIP.  
- Select a WIP calculation method.  
- Exclude part of a project from the WIP.  
- Post the WIP to the general ledger.  
- Reverse a WIP posting.  

Each step of the process calculates the value and moves the project transactions to the general ledger. The calculation and posting steps are separated to help you review your data and to make modifications before posting to the general ledger. Therefore, you should make sure that all information is correct after you run the calculation batch jobs and before you run the posting batch jobs.  

## Roles

This walkthrough uses the project team member (Tricia) as the persona.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS International Ltd., a design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures, such as conference halls and offices, with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of the work at CRONUS is project-oriented and Tricia, a project team member, uses project to have an overview of ongoing and completed projects. Some projects can be lengthy and take months to complete. Tricia can use a WIP account to record the work in process and track the costs throughout the project.  

## Calculating WIP

CRONUS has taken on a lengthy project that has now extended across reporting periods. Tricia calculates the work in process (WIP) to make sure that the financial statement is accurate.  

During this procedure, Tricia selects a specific group of tasks to include in the WIP calculation. On the **Project Task Lines** page, Tricia specifies the lines in the **WIP-Total** column.  

The following table describes the options.  

|Field|Description|  
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**\<blank\>**|Leave blank if the project task is a part of a group of tasks.|  
|**Total**|Defines the range or group of tasks that are included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, the WIP total includes any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting**, unless its **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**.|  
|**Excluded**|Applies only to a task with a **Project Task Type** of **Posting**. The task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated.|  

In the following walkthrough, Tricia applies the Cost Value method, which is their company standard, to calculate WIP. Tricia specifies the part of the project to include in the WIP calculation by assigning WIP-Total values to various project task lines.  

### To calculate WIP  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Edit** action. This opens the Project Card in edit mode.  

     WIP can be calculated based on Cost Value, Sales Value, Cost of Sales, Percentage of Completion, or Completed Contract. In this example, CRONUS uses the Cost Value method.  

3. On the **Posting** FastTab, choose the **WIP Method** field, and then select **Cost Value**.  
4. Choose the **Project Task Lines** action and set the following values in the **WIP-Total** field.  

   |Project Task No.|WIP-Total Field|  
   |------------------|----------------------|  
   |1130|Excluded|  
   |1190|Total|  
   |1210|Excluded|  
   |1310|Excluded|  

5. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Calculate WIP** action.  
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, select a project to calculate WIP for. On the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
7. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a date that's later than the work date.
8. In the **Document No.** field, enter **1**. You can use this number later for traceability.  
9. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job. A message is displayed. Choose the **OK** button to continue. Close the **Project Task Lines** page.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The message states that there are warnings associated with the WIP calculation. You'll review the warnings in the next procedure.  

10. On the **Project Card** page, expand the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab to see the calculated values. You can also see the **WIP Posting Date** and the values posted to the general ledger, if any.  

   Notice that the value for **Recog. Costs Amount** is 215.60 in the **To Post** column. This reflects the total costs of two of the items in the group of project tasks 1110 – 1130. The third item was set to **Excluded**, and therefore isn't included in the WIP calculation.  

### To review WIP warnings  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Show Warnings** action.  
3. On the **Project WIP Warnings** page, review the warning associated with the project.  

   After the accounting period ends, Tricia must recalculate WIP to include the work completed to this point.  

### To recalculate WIP  

1. On the **Project Card** page, choose the **WIP Entries** action to view the WIP calculation.  

     The **Project WIP Entries** page shows the WIP entries that were last calculated on a project, even if WIP hasn't yet been posted to the general ledger.  

2. You can follow the steps in the procedure that explains how to calculate WIP to recalculate WIP. Every time WIP is calculated, an entry is created on the **Project WIP Entries** page.  
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> WIP and recognition are calculated but aren't posted to the general ledger. To post, use the **Post WIP to G/L** action after you calculate the WIP and recognition.

## Posting WIP to general ledger

Now that Tricia has calculated WIP for this project, they can post it to the general ledger.  

### To post WIP to general ledger  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, on the **Projects** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to post WIP to the general ledger.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

   After you complete the posting, you can view the posting information on the **WIP G/L Entries** page.  

7. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action.  

   On the **Project WIP G/L Entries** page, verify that the WIP posted to the general ledger.  

8. Close the page.  
9. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
10. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, notice that in the **Posted** column, the **Recog. Costs G/L Amount** field is filled in, which indicates that WIP was posted to the general ledger successfully.  
11. Choose the **OK** button to close the card.  

## Reversing a WIP posting

Tricia determines that the project tasks that were excluded from the calculation of WIP should have been included. Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings without having to post new WIP postings.  

### To reverse a WIP posting  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post to WIP to G/L** page, on the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Reversal Posting Date** field, enter the original posting date. It should be the same date that you used to calculate WIP the first time.  
6. Select the **Reverse Only** checkbox. This reverses the previously posted WIP, and posts new WIP to the general ledger.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job, and choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
8. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
9. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, verify that there aren't any posted WIP entries.  
10. Close this page.  
11. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action. The WIP entries have the **Reversed** checkbox selected.  
12. Close this page.  
13. Open **Project Task Lines** for the project, include the parts of the project that should be in the WIP calculation, and then recalculate and post the new value to the general ledger.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Suppose Tricia calculated and posted WIP for a project with incorrect dates. Following the method that was discussed earlier, Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings, correct the dates, and post to the general ledger.

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

* Assemble to order  
* Assemble to stock  

## Assemble to order

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. For example, for the following reasons:

* You'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* You want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

The following list describes some of the benefits of the assemble-to-order process:  

* Customize assembly items when taking a sales order.  
* Overview availability of the assembly item and its components.  
* Reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment.  
* Determine the profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost.  
* Integrated with the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier.  
* Assemble to order when you create a sales quote or a blanket sales order.  
* Combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities.  

In the assemble-to-order process, you assemble items for a sales order. There's a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order.  

When you enter an assemble-to-order item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created. The assembly order is based on the sales line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly BOM. The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. The delivery date is based on the availability of components. To learn more about assembling items for sales orders, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can sell inventory quantities and assemble-to-order quantities on the same sales order. To learn more about combining stock and assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-order, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Order**.  

## Assemble to stock

Use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. Assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. You can also consume these items as subassembly components. The items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. To learn more about assembly items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

When you specify an assemble-to-stock item on a sales line, the item is treated like any other item sold from inventory. For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks availability only for the assembled item only, and not its components.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can assemble an item to order even if the item is set up to be assembled to stock. Learn more at [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-stock, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Stock**.  

## Combination scenarios

When assemble-to-order and inventory quantities are combined on a sales order, assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped first.  

If an assembly order is linked to a sales order line, the value in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field via the **Quantity** field on the assembly order. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is related to the **Qty. to Ship** field on the sales order line. This relation manages how you ship partial and complete assemble-to-order quantities:

* When the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order
* In combination scenarios where part of the quantity is assembled to order and part is shipped from inventory.

The combination scenario allows flexibility for partial shipments. You can use the **Quantity to Assemble** field to specify the quantity to ship partially from inventory and by assembling to order.  

If the full sales line quantity must be assembled to order and shipped, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the linked assembly order when you change the quantity to ship. This update ensures that the quantity being shipped is fully supplied by the assemble-to-order quantity.  

However, in combination scenarios, the full value in the **Qty. to Ship** is not copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the assembly order. Instead, a default value is inserted in the **Quantity to Assemble** field. The value is calculated from the **Qty. to Ship** field to ensure the assemble-to-order quantities ship first.

To deviate from the default, for example because you only want to assemble more or less of the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field within predefined rules, as illustrated below.  

An example of why you would modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post the shipment of inventory quantities before you ship the assembly output.  

The following tables explain the rules that define the minimum and maximum values that you can enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field to deviate from the default value in a combination scenario. The table shows a combination scenario where the **Qty. to Ship** field on the linked sales order line is changed from 7 to 4, and the **Quantity to Assemble** is therefore defaulted to 4.  

**Sales Order Line**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 10          | 7                | 7                             | 0                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4                |                               |                      |

**Assembly Order Header**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 7           | 7                | 0                             | 7                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4 (inserted by default)|                         |                      |

Based on this example, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field as follows:  

* The minimum quantity you can enter is 1. You must assemble at least one unit to be able to sell the four units, assuming that the remaining three are available in inventory.  
* The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4. This limit ensures that you don't assemble more of the item than you need for the sale.

# Print the picking list

You can print an inventory picking list directly from a sales order and other documents that initiate the shipment of items.

This report is typically used in companies without dedicated functionality for warehouse management, so that an inventory worker can view or print the picking list from the related sales document. In companies with higher volume or more complex processes, shipping and picking are planned and performed in dedicated warehouse documents. Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## To print a picking list from a sales order

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other documents that can be used to initiate shipment of items, such as a transfer order.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales order that you want to pick items for.  
3. Choose the **Report** action, and then choose the **Picking List by Order** action.  
4. Choose the **Print** button to print the picking list or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

You can also save the picking list as a document, for example, to send to someone or to add as an attachment to the sales order. Learn more at [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the **Explode BOM** function on the sales order, then only the components of the related assembly item are shown in the report. Learn more at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries
When parts of a document line quantity are posted, only that particular quantity is transferred to the item ledger entries and its item tracking numbers. However, you will want to access all relevant item tracking information directly from the active document line. That is, not only will you want to see the entries that are related to the remaining quantity, you will also want information about the units that have been posted. When you view or modify the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the collective contents of the **Tracking Specification** table (T336) and **Reservation Entry** table (T337) are presented in a temporary version of T336. This ensures that historic and active item tracking data is accessed as one.  

 The following table shows how T336 and T337 are used in a purchase scenario. The bold figures represent values that the user manually enters on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 Step 1: Create a purchase order line of seven pieces with item tracking numbers.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**T337**|7|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|0|0|0|0|0|  

 Step 2: Receive four pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**4**|**0**|0|0|  
|**T337**|3|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|4|0|0|4|0|  

 Step 3: Receive two pieces and invoice two pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**2**|**2**|4|0|  
|**T337**|1|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|6|0|0|6|2|  

 Step 4: Receive one piece.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**1**|**0**|6|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|2|  

 Invoice 5 pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|0|**5**|7|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|7|

# Default data for sustainability

To simplify how you manage your sustainability accounts and emissions, you can create default values for the following entities:  

- **G/L Account** (only available default sustainability account)
- **Item** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Resource** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Work Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Machine Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you set default values, you can change them on journals and documents as needed. These values are simply defaults and aren't mandatory.  

## G/L accounts

To set up a default sustainability account for a G/L account, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **No.** field, choose the number for the account you want to configure to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.
4. Close the page.

## Items

For items, you can use the manually entered sustainability account, or use the default value you have on the **Item Category**. The following processes explain both options.

### Specify a default sustainability account for an item category

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item categories**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, choose the code for the category you want to configure to open the **Item Category Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default for the category.
4. Close the page.

### Specify default sustainability values for an item  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to set up default values.  
3. Add the default sustainability account:

   1. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.  
   2. If you configured default sustainability accounts on item categories, select the **Item Category Code** you want to use on the **Item** FastTab. The default value for the category updates the value in **Default Sust. Account** field.

4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this item:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add default emissions only if the **Replenishment System** is set to **Purchase**. For other options, you can only set up the **Default Sust. Account**. CO2e (carbon equivalent) is calculated based on your production or assembly processes. If you already filled in the emissions fields and then change the replenishment system to something other than **Purchase**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing emissions.

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field if you're just setting up this item and you don't have earlier transactions. By default, this action updates this item only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of items.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the item and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The information you enter for emissions and the calculated **CO2e per Unit** are overridden by the system's calculations for this item based on **Sustainability Value Entry**. This data comes from the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, and uses the average method of emission calculation. Therefore, manually calculated **CO2e per Unit** is only used before posting documents with the correct values. This means you can use manual creation for data planning (**Production BOM**, **Assembly Order**, and so on) before you post the related document.  

## Resources

To set up default sustainability values for a resource, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **resources**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for a resource for which you want to set up default values.
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for the resource:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this resource only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the resource and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

## Work centers

To set up default sustainability values for a work center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Work Center Card** page for a work center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this work center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this work center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of work centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this work center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

7. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Work Centers** list page. You can also apply this action to machine centers.  

## Machine centers

To set up default sustainability values for a machine center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Machine centers**, and then select the related link.

# Sharing Business Data from Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data, like a list of records, specific records, or documents. <!--, with others&mdash;even those people who don't have a Business Central license in some cases.-->

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions of Business Central.

## Copying a link

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and distribute it in other forms of media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser's address box.

When you paste the URL into a rich text editor like Word, Outlook, or Teams, instead of displaying the full URL, the link is given a more readable name that clearly indicates context of the target. The name and pattern vary depending on what page you're linking to. Consider the following examples:

|Pattern|Page example|Link name|
|-|-|-|
|List pages|**Items** list page | **Items**|
|List view|	**Open** filtered view on **Sales Orders** list|**Sales Orders - Open**|
| Single record|Item card showing single record|"Item Card - 1896 ∙ ATHENS Desk"|
|Draft records|	New customer card|**New - Customer card**|
|Company that uses badge|**Items** list page for company with badge **CRONUS**| **Items (CRONUS)**|

> [!TIP]
> A similar naming convention is used on browser tabs.

### Share data analysis
If you're viewing a page or query in the data analysis mode, you can share a specific analysis tab by selecting the down arrowhead on the tab, and then selecting **Copy link**. [Learn more about data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). 

### Modify the page link

After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what shows when the page opens. You can, for example, add filters or specify a different company.

[Learn more about the web client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

### About filtered lists

Using the filter pane on list pages, you can apply filters to narrow-down the records shown in the list. If you use the **Copy Link** action or copy the URL from the browser, the page link won't include your filter changes. Users that open the link see the full collection. The way to keep the filtering on a collection page link is to save the filtered page as a **View** first. Then, open the view and copy the link from there.

[Learn more about sorting, searching, and filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## Sharing to Teams

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Not Supported](media/x-icon.png) Business Central On-premises

Directly from most collection pages and details pages, you can send a link to the page to people, group chats or channels. For example, share a link to a filtered view of your records. If you've installed the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, the link will automatically expand into a compact card for you to include with your message. Recipients then select the link or card to open the page in Business Central.

[Learn more about sharing records and page links in Teams](across-working-with-teams.md).

## Sharing Through OneDrive

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Share** opens a page the let's you select who you want to share the file with. Recipients get a notification email to access the file from your OneDrive.

[Learn more about sharing files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).

## Opening in Excel

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

For list pages and lists embedded on a page, you can use the **Open in Excel** action. This action exports the list of records to an Excel workbook (.xlsx file), which you can share with others. In the workbook, you can also use the Share feature that's part of Excel.

[Learn more about viewing and editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).

## Sharing rows or tables

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

You can share one or more records in a list. Just select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy to your clipboard. Then paste what you copied into another application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. For example, copying three sales orders and pasting that into an email will display the orders in a nicely formatted table.

# Set Up Vendor Bank Accounts

Just as you can use bank account information on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your company's banking transactions, you can also set banking details for vendors. Vendor bank account data can simplify payments to suppliers when combined with the [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) or the [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md) feature, for example.

## Add or edit a vendor bank account

[!INCLUDE [purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can set additional vendor bank accounts on the **Vendor Bank Account List** page.

## Set up a preferred vendor bank account

If a vendor has one or more bank accounts and you want to set a preferred option for the payment journal lines, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the vendor.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, choose the default vendor bank account in the **Preferred Bank Account Code** field.

# View the availability of items

From the context of a business task, you can get advanced information about when and where an item is available, such as when talking to a customer about a delivery date.

You can view the availability of all items per location, and you can view the availability of each item by event or by period as well. An event is any scheduled item transaction, such as a sales shipment or an inbound transfer receipt.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Availability views by location require that you maintain inventory at more than one location. For more information, see [Set Up Locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md).

If you use warehousing functionality, availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with. A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows. For more information, see [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], availability figures are typically shown in two different fields, each with a different definition:

* The **Quantity on Hand** field, in some places named **Inventory**, shows the actual quantity today according to posted item ledger entries.
* The **Projected Available Balance** field is calculated and shows the quantity on hand plus scheduled receipts minus gross requirements. (In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], scheduled receipts include quantities on purchase orders and inbound transfer orders. Gross requirements include quantities on sales orders and outbound transfer orders.)

> [!TIP]  
>   The projected available balance is especially relevant to view in the **Item Availability by Periods** and **Item Availability by Event** pages because they contain the date dimension.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedures describe how to view advanced availability information from the items list and item card. You can also access the information from sales document lines for the item on the line. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To view the availability of an item according to when it will be received or shipped

You view the availability of an item according to scheduled item transactions on the **Availability by Event** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Event** action.

    The **Item Availability by Event** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time according to scheduled shipment and receipt events. The page gives a condensed view that shows one line of accumulated information per time interval in which inventory quantities change. Time intervals where no events occurred aren't shown. You can expand each line to show details about the event or events that caused the accumulated quantity on the line.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item in different periods

You view the availability of an item over time for specified time periods on the **Item Availability by Periods** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Period** action.

    The **Item Availability by Periods** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time, shown for a period that you select, such as Day, Week, or Quarter.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item at the locations where it's stored

You view the availability of an item at the different places where it's stored on the **Item Availability by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Location** action.

    The **Item Availability by Location** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop in the future, shown for each location where it's stored.
4. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.
5. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of all items by the location where they're stored

You view the availability of all your items across all your locations on the **Items by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Items by Location** action.

    The **Items by Location** page shows for all your items how many are available at each location.
3. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item by its use in assembly or production BOMs

If an item is part of assembly or production BOMs as either a parent item or a component, you can view how many units of it are required on the **Item Availability by BOM Level** page. The page shows how many units of a parent item you can make based on the availability of child items on underlying lines. Any item that has an assembly or production BOM is shown on the page as a collapsible line. You can expand this line to see the underlying components and lower-level subassemblies with their own BOMs.

For example, you can use the page to determine whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability and the quantities that can be supplied by its components. You can also use the page to identify bottlenecks in related BOMs.

On each line on the page for both parent items and child items, the following key fields specify the availability figures. You can use these figures to promise how many units of a parent you can supply if you start the related assembly process.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Able to Make Parent**|Shows how many units of any subassembly in the top item you can make. The field specifies how many immediate parent units you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|
|**Able to Make Top Item**|Shows how many units of the top item you can make. The field specifies how many units of the top-line BOM item you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|

### To view the availability of an item according to demand for its parent

The **Item Availability by BOM Level** page shows information for the item on the card or document line that the page is opened for. The item is always shown on the top line. You can view information for other items or for all items by changing the value in the **Item Filter** field.

> [!NOTE]  
>   By default, availability figures on the lines show the total availability of all items under the top item. These figures are displayed in the **Available Quantity** field, and the focus is on the top item. However, information about how many subassemblies you can make may be skewed. To get a true indication of how many of the shown subassemblies you can make, you must clear the **Show Total Availability** check box and then see the figure in the **Able to Make Parent** field.

The **Bottleneck** field specifies which item in the BOM structure restricts you from making a larger quantity than the quantity that is shown in the **Able to Make Top Item** field. For example, the bottleneck item can be a purchased component with an expected receipt date that is too late to make additional units of the top item by the date in the **Needed by Date** field.

## To view the availability of an item by its units of measure

The **Item Availability by Unit of Measure** page shows the availability of an item in the units of measure that it's stored in.

> [!NOTE]  
> To keep this information accurate, you must convert item units of measure. For example, if you purchase an item in one unit of measure, such as boxes, and you sell items in another unit of measure, such as pieces, you must use an item journal to convert the units of measure, or "unbox" items. You can use a negative adjustment item journal line to reduce inventory in the purchase unit of measure, for example boxes, and a positive adjustment to increase inventory in the sales unit of measure, for example pieces. 

## To view the availability of an item by its variants

The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows the actual and projected availability of an item grouped according to variant code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Variant** action.

    The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows availability for every variant that exists for the item. The page is empty if no variants exist for the item.

4. In the **View by** field, select the length of the time period that you want to view.
5. View the availability figures in the different quantity fields for each line.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Assembly availability page

The **Assembly Availability** page shows detailed availability information for the assembly item. It opens:

- Automatically from a sales order line in assemble-to-order scenarios when you enter a quantity that causes a component availability issue.
- Automatically from an assembly order header when you enter a value in the Quantity field that causes a component availability issue.
- Manually when you open it from an assembly order. On the Actions tab, in the Functions group, select Show Availability.

The **Details** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly item, including how many of the assembly order quantity can be assembled by the due date based on availability of the required components. This is shown in the Able to Assemble field on the Details FastTab.

The value in the **Able to Assemble** field is shown in red font if the quantity is lower than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field, indicating that there aren't enough components available to assemble the full quantity.

The **Lines** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly components.

If one or more assembly components aren't available, then this is reflected in the **Able to Assemble** field on the line in question as a quantity less than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the **Details** FastTab.

# Walkthrough: Planning supplies automatically

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

Phrases like "run planning" and "run MRP" refer to the calculation of the master production schedule (MPS) and the material requirements plan (MRP) based on actual and forecasted demand.  

-   MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called "MPS items" and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
-   MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that aren't MPS items. The overall purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the right item at the right time, in the right place, in the right quantity.  

 The planning algorithms used for both MPS and MRP are identical. The planning algorithms use netting, reuse of existing supply orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is needed or will be needed (demand) and what is available or expected (supply). When these quantities are netted against each other, action messages are displayed in the planning worksheet. Action messages are suggestions to create a new supply order, change a supply order (quantity or date), or cancel an existing supply order. Supply orders can be production orders, purchase orders, and transfer orders. For more information, see [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

 The planning result is calculated partly from the demand-supply sets in the database and partly by the setup of stockkeeping unit cards or item cards, production BOMs, and routings.  

## About this walkthrough  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how to use the supply planning system to automatically plan all the purchase and production orders required to produce 15 touring bicycles demanded on different sales orders. To provide a clear and realistic walkthrough, the number of planning lines is delimited by filtering out all other demand-supply sets in the CRONUS demonstration company except the sales demand at location EAST.  

 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Creating the sales order and calculating a complete supply plan.  
-   Viewing planning parameters and order tracking entries behind the planning lines.  
-   Automatically creating the suggested supply orders.  
-   Creating new sales demand and replanning accordingly.  

## Roles  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

-   The CRONUS International Ltd. demonstration company.  
-   To change various item setup values by following the steps in the "Preparing Sample Data" section, later in this walkthrough.  

## Story  
 The customer, Cannon Group PLC, orders five touring bikes for shipment on 02-05-2021 (February 5).  

 Eduardo, the production planner, performs the routine supply planning for the first week of February 2021. Eduardo filters on their own location, EAST, and enters a planning interval of the work date (01-23-2021) to 02-07-2021 before calculating an initial supply plan.  

 The only demand that week is for the Cannon Group sales order. Eduardo sees that none of the planning lines have warnings, and proceeds to create supply orders without changes for the suggested planning lines.  

 The next day, before any of the initial supply orders are started or posted, Eduardo is notified when another customer orders ten touring bikes for shipment on 02-12-2021. Eduardo recalculates to adjust the supply plan according to the change of demand. The recalculation gives you a net change plan that suggests changes to both time and quantity of some of the supply orders created in the first run.  

 During the various planning steps, Eduardo looks up the involved orders, and uses the Order Tracking feature to see which demand is covered by which supply.  

## Preparing sample data  
 Create stockkeeping units (SKUs) for the touring bike and a selection of its components, item numbers 1001 to 1300. (Some components are excluded to simplify the procedures.) Adjust the planning parameters of the selected components to provide a more transparent planning result.  

### To create stockkeeping units  

1.  Open the item card for item 1001, Touring Bicycle.  
2.  Choose the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** action.  
3.  On the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** page, leave all options and filters unchanged, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all items in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

### To change selected planning parameters  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the EAST stockkeeping unit card for item 1100, Front Wheel.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Reordering Policy|Safety Stock Quantity|Lot Accumulation Period|Rescheduling Period|  
    |-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
    |Lot-for-Lot|Blank|2W|2W|  

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all SKUs in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

 This completes the preparation of sample data for the walkthrough.  

## Creating a regenerative supply plan  
 In reaction to a new sales order for five touring bikes, Ricardo begins the planning process by setting options, filters, and planning interval to exclude all other demand except that of the first week of February at location EAST. Ricardo begins by calculating a master production schedule (MPS), and then proceeds to calculate a complete supply plan for all lower-level demand (MRP).  

### To create the sales order  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Cannon Group|02-05-2014|1001|EAST|5|  

4.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the new demand quantity.  

### To create a regenerative plan to fulfill demand at location EAST  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = No|01-23-2021<br /><br /> (work date)|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     One planning line is created suggesting that a planned production order is issued to produce the ten touring bikes, item 1001, by 02-05-2021, the shipment date of the sales order.  

     Next, verify that this planning line relates to the Cannon Group sales order by using the **Order Tracking** function, which dynamically links demand with its planned supply.  

5.  Select the new planning line, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  
6.  On the **Order Tracking** page, choose the **Show** action.  

     The sales order for five touring bikes shipping to customer number 10000 on 02-05-2021 is shown.  

7.  Close the **Sales Order** and **Order Tracking** pages.  

### To calculate MRP to include underlying component needs  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to:|  
    |---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     A total of 14 planning lines are created suggesting supply orders for all the demand that the touring bike sales order at EAST location represents.  

## Analyze the planning result  
 To analyze the suggested quantities, Eduardo drills down on selected planning lines to view order tracking entries and planning parameters.  

 On the **Planning Worksheet** page, note in the **Due Date** column that the suggested supply orders are scheduled backward from the due date of the sales order, 02-05-2021. The timeline begins on the top planning line with the production order to produce the finished touring bikes. The timeline ends on the bottom planning line with the purchase order for one of the lowest-level items, 1255, Socket Back, due on 01-30-2021. Like the planning line for item 1251, Axle Back Wheel, this line represents a purchase order for components that are due on the starting date of its produced parent, subassembly item 1250, which in turn is due on 02-03-2014. Throughout the worksheet, you can see that all underlying items are due on the starting date of their parents.  

 The planning line for item 1300, Chain Assy, suggests ten pieces. This deviates from the five pieces that we expect to need to fulfill the sales order. Proceed to view the order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1300  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1300, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The two lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five pieces are tracked from the planning line (first order tracking line) to sales order 1001 (second order tracking line). The last five pieces suggested on the planning line aren't related to any document lines, but to a planning parameter, forecast entry, or blanket order entry. Such untracked quantities are summed in the **Untracked Quantity** field in the header of the **Order Tracking** page.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1300 uses a planning parameter, Minimum Order Quantity, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for ten pieces in total, of which only five can be tracked to a demand. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter. Proceed to review the planning parameter.  

### To check the planning parameter  

1.  On the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, select the order tracking line for item 1300.  
2.  Choose the **Item No.** field, and then choose the **Advanced** action.  
3.  On the **Item List** page, choose the **Stockkeeping Units** action.  
4.  On the **Stockkeeping Unit List** page, open the EAST stockkeeping unit card.  
5.  On the **Planning** FastTab, note that the **Minimum Order Quantity** field contains 10.  
6.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view more order tracking entries  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1110, Rim, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five rims are needed for each production order for front and back wheels respectively.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for items 1120, 1160, and 1170. For item 1120, the **Quantity per** field on the production BOM of each wheel item is 50 PCS, which results in a total need of 100.  

     The planning line for item 1150 for six pieces looks irregular. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Select the planning line for item 1150, and then, on then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five units are tracked to the front wheel, and one unit is untracked. Proceed to view the untracked quantity.  

3.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1150 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 2.00, which specifies that when the item is ordered, it must be in a quantity that is divisible by 2. The closest number to 5 that is divisible by 2 is 6.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for the Front Hub components, items 1151 and 1155, except that each need is multiplied by the scrap percentage that is defined for item 1150 in the **Scrap Percentage** field on the item card.  

 This completes the analysis of the initial supply plan. Notice that the **Accept Action Message** check box is selected in all planning lines indicating that they're ready to be converted to supply orders.  

## Carrying out action messages  
 Next, Eduardo converts the suggested planning lines to supply orders by using the **Carry Out Action Msg.** function.  

### To automatically create the suggested supply orders  

1.  Select the **Accept Action Message** check box on all planning lines with a warning of type Exception.  
2.  Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3.  On the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Production Order|Purchase Order|Transfer Order|  
    |----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  
    |Firm Planned|Make Purch. Orders|Make Trans. Orders|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to automatically create all the suggested supply orders.  
5.  Close the empty **Planning Worksheet** page.  

 This completes the initial calculation, analysis, and creation of a supply plan for demand at location EAST in the first week of February. In the following section, another customer orders ten touring bikes, and Eduardo must replan.  

## Creating a net change plan  
 The next day, before any supply orders are started or posted, a new sales order arrives from Libros S.A. for ten touring bikes to be shipped on 02-12-2021. Eduardo is notified of the new demand, and proceeds to replan in order to adjust the current supply plan. Eduardo uses the Net Change Plan function to calculate only the changes that are made to demand or supply since the last planning run. In addition, Eduardo expands the planning period to 02-14-2021 to include the new sales demand on 02-12-2014.  

 The planning system calculates the best way to cover the demand for these two identical products, such as to consolidate some purchase and production orders, reschedule other orders, and create new orders where it's required.  

### To create the new sales, demand and replan accordingly  

1.  Choose the **New** action.  
2.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Libros S.A.|02-12-2021|1001|EAST|10|  

3.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the demand quantity.  
4.  Proceed to replan to adjust the current supply plan.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Choose the **Calculate Net Change Plan** action.  
7.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-14-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

8.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

 A total of 14 planning lines are created. Notice in the first planning line that the **Action Message** field contains **New**, the **Quantity** field 10, and the **Due Date** field 02-12-21. This new line for the top parent item, 1001, Touring Bike, is created because the item uses a reordering policy of **Order**, which means that it must be supplied in a one-to-one relationship to its demand, the sales order of ten pieces.  

 The next two planning lines are the production orders for touring bike wheels. Each existing order of five, in the **Original Quantity** field, is increased to 15, in the **Quantity** field. Both production orders have unchanged due dates, as indicated in the **Action Message** field that contains **Change Qty.** This is also the case for the planning line for item 1300, except its order multiple of 10.00 rounds the tracked demand for 15 pieces up to the 20.  

 All other planning lines have an action message of **Resched. & Chg. Qty.**. This means that apart from being increased in quantity, the due dates are moved in relation to the supply plan to include the extra quantity in the available production time (capacity). Purchased components are rescheduled and increased to supply the production orders. Proceed to analyze the new plan.  

## Analyze the changed planning result  
 Because all lot-for-lot-planned items within the filter, 1100 to 1300, have a rescheduling period of two weeks, their existing supply orders are all modified to meet the new demand, which occurs within the specified two weeks.  

 Several planning lines are multiplied by three to provide 15 touring bikes instead of 5, and the due dates are moved back in time to provide the increased quantities by the shipment date of the sales order to the Cannon Group. For these planning lines, all quantities can be tracked. The remaining planning lines are increased by ten pieces in addition to moving their due dates. For these planning lines, a part of the quantities are untracked due to different planning parameters. Proceed to view some of these order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1250  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1250, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The seven lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five and ten pieces are tracked through the back wheel to the touring bikes on the two sales orders respectively.  

     The last five pieces are untracked. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1250 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for 20 pieces in total to round the actual need up to the nearest number divisible by 10. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter.  

3.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view an existing order  

1.  In the planning line for item 1250, choose the **Ref. Order No.** field.  
2.  On the **Firm Planned Prod. Order** page for the Back Hub. The existing order for ten pieces, which you created in the first planning run, opens.  
3.  Close the firm planned production order.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how the planning system is used to automatically detect demand, calculate the appropriate supply orders according to demand and planning parameters, and then automatically create different types of supply orders with the appropriate dates and quantities.

# Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Order Agent in Business Central automates processing sales orders from customer email requests. This article explains how to set up, activate, configure the Sales Order Agent, and manage user access.

Learn more about the agent in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Prerequisites

Before configuring and activating the sales order agent, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The Business Central environment is one of these country/region versions: AU (Australia), CA (Canada), GB (Great Britain), NZ (New Zealand), or US (United States).

  Sales Order Agent is currently unavailable in other countries/region versions. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).
- Set up the email account for receiving incoming requests for sales quotes and orders.

   The Sales Order Agent monitors incoming emails to this mailbox. The email account must be a **Microsoft 365** type (user mailbox or shared mailbox) in your organization. Learn more at [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To activate and configure the agent, you need **Read and manage (Full Access)** and **Send as** permission on the mailbox, unless it's your personal mailbox. As an Exchange admin, delegate these permissions to all users who need to activate and configure the agent. Learn more in [Use the Exchange admin center to edit shared mailbox delegation](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).
   >
   > When a user activates the agent, it runs as a background task in the context of that user and needs access to the shared mailbox to process emails. It might take a few hours for Exchange to propagate the permissions to the selected users.
- Set up the Business Central environment for billing agent capabilities (preview version 26.0 sandbox environments in Great Britain and United States only).

   Agents use Microsoft Copilot Studio messages when a user runs it, which your company is charged for. Learn more in [Manage consumption-based billing](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-consumption-billing).

- Turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle in the **Sales Order Agent** extension settings (sandbox environments only)

   Open the [Extension management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2500) page, select **Sales Order Agent**, and then turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle.

## Turn on the Sales Order Agent capability for the environment

The agent capability is on if the ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon appears in the top navigation menu of the role center.

![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon on a role center](media/soa-in-role-center.svg)

If the icon isn't present, turn it on from the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, like other Copilot features in Business Central. The Sales Order Agent is listed under **Production ready previews**. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and AI agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

Next, configure and activate the agent so it can process customer sales orders.

## Configure and activate Sales Order Agent

Configure and activate the Sales Order Agent for your company. Only one Sales Order Agent is allowed per company, but you can give access to many users.

1. In the navigation bar at the upper right of the role center, select ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** > **Activate**.

1. On the **Configure the Copilot agent** page, turn on the **Monitor incoming information** toggle, select the **Mailbox** check box, and then set **Mailbox** field to the email account you want the agent to monitor.

   ![Shows the Sales Order Agent configuration page](media/soa-configuration.png)

1. Select **Manage user access** to specify the users who can manage or interact with the agent. You can add more users now or later. Learn more in [Manage user access to the Sales Order Agent](#manage-agent-permissions-and-user-access).
1. Turn on the **Active** toggle.
1. On the right side of the page, select the **Go to next card** arrow to choose how the agent helps with inquiries, quotes, and orders.

    There are several options described in the following table:

    |Option|Description|Default|
    |-|-|-|
    |Select only available items|Specifies whether the agent considers item availability when searching for the customer's requested items.<br><br>When on, the agent checks inventory to determine whether the customer's requested item quantity is available based on their requested delivery date and location code. If there aren't enough items, the agent prepares the reply to the user that the requested items aren't available, even in situations when fewer items are available. <br><br>When off, the agent includes the customer's requested item quantity regardless of availability. That is, quotes can be created for the items which aren't available and their availability can become negative.<br><br>Learn more about item availability in [Get an availability overview](inventory-how-availability-overview.md) or open the [Item Availability page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=4410).|On|
    |Create sales documents|When on, the agent can create sales quotes and orders from email inquiries based on the remaining options in this table.<br><br>When off, the agent handles only email communication and doesn't create quotes or orders. The remaining options are irrelevant and can’t be set.|On|
    |Review quotes when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales quote before creating an outgoing email with the quote details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates or modifies sales quotes as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the quote as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the email before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|
    |Make orders from quotes|When on, the agent converts confirmed sales quotes into orders after the customer agrees to the quote via email and the Business Central user confirms the email.<br><br>When off, you have to create the order manually.|On|
    |Review orders when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales order before creating an outgoing email with the order details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates the sales order as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the order as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the order before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|

1. Select **Update** to complete the setup.
1. Ensure the Sales Order Agent's language is set to a supported language.

   When you configure the agent, it uses the same language as the display language of your workspace. [Learn how to change the agent's language](#change-language-and-regional-settings).

The **Sales Order Agent** icon changes to ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png), indicating the agent is active and ready to handle incoming quote requests to the mailbox.

When the Sales Order Agent is active, a scheduled task added to job queue runs every 20 seconds on the mailbox. This task monitors new unread messages in the mailbox. If a new unread message is found, the Sales Order Agent imports the message into Business Central and verifies whether there's already a task for the mail thread. If a task for the thread already exists, the Sales Order Agent incorporates the new message into the existing task. Otherwise, it creates a new task for the message.

> [!NOTE]
> The ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon when the agent is configure but not active](media/soa-not-activated-icon.png) icon indicates the agent is configured with mailbox, but it's not active. To activate it, select the icon, then select ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure Sales Order Agent** to reopen the configuration page. From there, turn on the **Active** toggle.

## Manage agent permissions and user access

### Add agent users

As an administrator, you can specify which users have permission to use or configure the Sales Order Agent. There are two ways to add and configure agent users:

#### [From Configure Sales Order Agent](#tab/soaconfig)

1. Open the **Configure Sales Order Agent** page by selecting ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** > ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure**.
1. Turn off the **Active** toggle.
1. Select **Manage user access**.
1. On the **Select users that can manage or interact with the Agent** page, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** check box. <br><br> The **Can configure** setting defines whether a user has access to update the agent configuration (for example, updating the designated mailbox, activating and deactivating the agent, and other settings) or only to work with the agent tasks (for example, reviewing and confirming agent steps).
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

#### [From Sales Order Agent card page](#tab/soapage)

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for  **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Set **Status** to **Disabled** to deactivate the agent.
1. In the **User access** section, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** check box.
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

---

### Manage agent permissions to objects, data, and UI elements

The Sales Order Agent has a user account in Business Central, similar to other users. To access this account, search for and open the **Agents** page, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]** to open the agent card page.

The **Agent Permission Sets** section lists all the permission sets currently assigned to the agent. By default, the Sales Order Agent has the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set. This set restricts access to only the objects, data, and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) necessary for handling sales quote requests.

You can't modify the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set directly, because it's a system permissions set. However, you can create a copy of **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set, modify the copy to suit your needs, then add it to **Agent Permission Sets** section, along with any other permission sets.

Before you can add or delete permission sets applied to the agent, change the **State** to disabled. When you're done making changes, set it back to **Enabled**.

The following system permissions are available for controlling user access to the agent's functionality:

- **Configure All Agents** (ID 9665): Grants a user access to manage the configuration settings of the Sales Order Agent.
- **Manage Agent Tasks** (ID 9670): Allows a user to work with agent tasks displayed in the Copilot pane.

These system permissions are also included in the following permission sets, entitlements, and license types:

- The **SECURITY** permission set includes the **Configure All Agents** permission.
- The **System Execute - Basic** permission set includes the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission.
- The **System Tables - Basic** permission set includes all virtual tables used by the agent (labeled as "Agent *" tables).
- Essential and Premium license entitlements now include **Manage Agent Tasks** permissions.
- All license types include **Configure All Agents** permissions.

Users can configure the Sales Order Agent if they have the **Configure All Agents** permission or are listed as an agent user with the **Can Configure** field selected.

Users can work with agent tasks in the Copilot pane if they have the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission (either explicitly or as part of their Essential or Premium license permissions) and are listed as an agent user.

## Change language and regional settings

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for  **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Select **User Settings**.
1. Set **Lanaguage** to a supported English locale.

# Create special orders

You can create a special order for a specific catalog item to be shipped to a specific customer. Your vendor ships the item to your warehouse and you can then ship the item on to your customer either independently or together with other items on another order.  

Special orders imply that the purchase and sales order are linked to ensure that the specific catalog item is picked and delivered to the customer.  

Before you can use this feature, you must first set up the customer, vendor, and item cards necessary for the order.  

## To create a special order

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. Create and fill in a  sales order for the item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the sales line. In the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Special Order** field selected.

    You must now create a purchase order from a requisition worksheet.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Choose the **Special Order** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Orders** action.  
6.  On the **Get Sales Orders** page, show results where the **Document No.** is the sales order number. Choose the **OK** button. A requisition worksheet line is created for the item.  
7.  On the requisition worksheet line, in the **Action Message** field, select **New**.  
8.  On the **Requisition Worksheets** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action. The **Carry Out Action Msg. - Req.** page opens. Choose the **OK** button.  

    A message appears telling you that the purchase orders have been created. Choose the **OK** button.  

A purchase order created as a special order for a sales order is respected by the planning system as it balances demand and supply. That is, the purchase order (supply) remains linked to the sales order (demand), even if that purchase order could supply another earlier demand. For more information, see [Design Details: Reordering Policies](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot use the special order functionality if the item is already reserved. Therefore, for items that are sold on special orders, make sure the **Reserve** field on the item card is not set to **Always**.

# Walkthrough: Picking and Shipping in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbount Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require pick processing but not ship processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post pick and ship information for your outbound source documents. The outbound source document can be a sales order, purchase return order, outbound transfer order, or a production order with component need.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up SOUTH location for inventory picks.  
- Creating a sales order for customer 10000 for 30 Amsterdam Lamps.  
- Releasing the sales order for warehouse handling.  
- Creating an inventory pick based on a released source document.  
- Registering the warehouse movement from the warehouse and at the same time posting the sales shipment for the source sales order.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Warehouse Worker  

<!-- ## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, a company based on the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option in a sandbox environment. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, CRONUS installed.
 -->

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, sets up SOUTH warehouse for basic pick handling where warehouse workers process outbound orders individually. Susan, the order processor, creates a sales order for 30 units of item 1928-S to be shipped to customer 10000 from the SOUTH Warehouse. John, the warehouse worker must make sure that the shipment is prepared and delivered to the customer. John manages all involved tasks on the **Inventory Pick** page, which automatically points to the bins where 1928-S is stored.

[!INCLUDE[set_up_location.md](includes/set_up_location.md)]

### Setting Up the Bin Codes

Once you have the location set up, you must add two bins.

#### To setup the bin codes

1. Select the **Bins** action.
2. Create two bins, with the codes *S-01-0001* and *S-01-0002*.

### Making Yourself a Warehouse Employee at Location SOUTH

In order to use this functionality, you must add yourself to the location as a warehouse worker. 

#### To make yourself a warehouse employee

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature first.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Warehouse Employees** page.
  3. In the **Location Code** field, choose SOUTH.  
  4. Select the **Default** field, and then select the **Yes** button.  

### Making Item 1928-S Available

To make item 1928-S available at the SOUTH location follow these steps:  

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature second.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Open the default journal, and then create two item journal lines with the following information about the work date (January 23).  

        |Entry Type|Item Number|Location Code|Bin Code|Quantity|  
        |----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0001|20|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0002|20|  

        By default, the **Bin Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

  3. Choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, and then choose **Post**.  
  4. Select the **Yes** button.  

## Creating the Sales Order

Sales orders are the most common type of outbound source document.  

### To create the sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature third.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a sales order for customer 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following sales order line.  

    |Item|Location Code|Quantity|  
    |----|-------------|--------|  
    |1928-S|SOUTH|30|  

     Proceed to notify the warehouse that the sales order is ready for warehouse handling.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    John proceeds to pick and ship the sold items.  

## Picking and Shipping Items

On the **Inventory Pick** page, you can manage all outbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a sales order. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To pick and ship items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature fourth.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Sales Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the sale to customer 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the sales order.  
5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 20 respectively on the two inventory pick lines.  
6. Choose the **Post** action, select **Ship**, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 30 Amsterdam Lamps are now registered as picked from bins S-01-0001 and S-01-0002, and a negative item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted sales shipment.

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Change settings in a new layout](#modify).

### [Export a layout copy and import it as a new layout](#tab/export)

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Export Layout** action.

    The layout file is downloaded to your device.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. Open the layout file in the appropriate application, such as Word (for a .docx file) or Excel (for an .xlsx file).

    Learn more in the following articles:

    * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
    * [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)

1. Follow one of these steps to upload the layout file for the report:

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |

# Create number series

For each company that you set up, you need to assign unique identification codes to things such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and other documents. Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

> [!Important]
> By default, gaps aren't allowed in number series because the exact history of financial transactions must be available for auditing, by law, and therefore must follow an unbroken sequence with no deleted numbers.
>
> If you want to allow gaps in certain number series, consult with your auditor or accounting manager to ensure that you adhere to the legal requirements in your country/region. For more information, see the [Gaps in Number Series](#gaps-in-number-series) section.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you use the same number series codes as you see listed on the **No. Series List** page in the CRONUS demonstration company. Codes such as *P-INV+* might not make immediate sense to you, but [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a number of default settings that depend on these number series codes.

You create a numbering system by setting up one or more codes for each type of master data or document. For example, you can set up one code for numbering customers, another code for numbering sales invoices, and another code for numbering documents in general journals. After you set up a code, you must set up at least one number series line. The number series line contains information such as the first and last number in the series and the starting date. You can set up more than one number series line per number series code, with a different starting date for each line. Number series are consecutive, starting each series on the respective starting date.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum length of a number in a number series is 20 characters. There are some situations where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will append a number with a system-generated ID. For example, when documents such as invoices are used to apply transactions, such as payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates identifiers for the applied transactions. The identifier is comprised of a number from a number series and a six character system-assigned ID, such as -12345. If you expect to process more than 9999 documents in bank or GIRO journals, or cash receipt journals, set up number series for those types of documents to include fewer than 14 characters.

You typically set up your number series to automatically insert the next consecutive number on new cards or documents that you create. However, you can also set up a number series to allow you to manually enter a number. To manually enter numbers, turn on the **Manual Nos.** toggle.

If you want to use more than one number series code for one type of master data - for example, if you want to use different number series for different categories of items - you can use number series relationships.

## Get assistance from Copilot

The suggest number series with Copilot feature can help administrators create and maintain number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language. To learn more about this AI-based capability, go to [Suggest number series with Copilot](suggest-number-series-copilot.md).

## Gaps in number series

Not all records that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are financial transactions that must use sequential numbering. For example, you assign number series to customers, sales quotes, and warehouse activities, but they aren't subject to financial auditing and can be deleted. For such number series, you can select the **Allow Gaps in Nos.** checkbox on the **No. Series Lines** page. This setting can also be changed after creating the number series. For more information, see [To create a new number series](ui-create-number-series.md#to-create-a-new-number-series).

## Behavior of the No. field on documents and cards

On sales, purchase, transfer, and service documents, and on all cards, the **No.** field can be filled in automatically from a predefined number series, or you can add it manually. <!--However, under certain circumstances, the **No.** field is invisible to prevent you from editing it.-->

The **No.** field can be filled in three ways:

1. If only one number series for the type of document or card exists, and the **Default Nos.** field is selected and the **Manual Nos.** field isn't selected for that number series, then the field is automatically filled with the next number in the series.<!-- The **No.** field doesn't display on the card or document.-->  

    <!--Even if you define templates with various number series for customers, if the number series that is defined in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page is set up in this way, the **No.** field doesn't display on the customer card, no matter which template you use. The same applies to other types of cards and documents.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the number series isn't working, for example because it's reached the last number defined for its range, the **No.** field displays so you can manually enter a number. You can resolve issues on the **No. Series** page.-->

2. If you have more than one number series for a type of document or card, and the **Default Nos.** checkbox isn't selected for the assigned number series, the **No.** field displays, and you can go to the **No. Series** page and select the number series you want to use. The next number in the series is then inserted in the **No.** field.

3. If you don't have a number series for a type of document or card, or if the **Manual Nos.** field is selected for the number series, the **No.** field displays and you must enter a number manually. You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.

When you open a new document or card that a number series exists for, the **No. Series Setup** page opens so that you can set up a number series for that type of document or card and continue working.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to enable manual numbering on, for example, new item cards that were created with a data migration process that has hidden the **No.** by default, go to the **Inventory Setup** page and choose the **Item Nos.** field to open and set the related number series to **Manual Nos.**.
>
> The same is true if you're using service management features. To resolve that issue, go to the **Service Management Setup** page and choose the **Service Item Nos.** field to set the number series to **Manual Nos.**.

## To create a new number series

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **Lines** action.  
5. On the **No. Series Lines** page, fill in the fields to define the actual use and content of the number series that you created in step 2.  
6. Repeat step 5 for as many different uses of the number series that you need. The **Starting Date** field defines which number series line is active.  

> [!TIP]
> To allow users to specify numbers manually when they register a new customer or vendor, for example, choose the **Manual Nos.** field on the number series itself. To prevent manual numbering, clear the field.

You can assign number series to the templates that you set up for the different types of customers and vendors that your sales people and purchasers most often add. In that case, set up the relevant number series, link them through relationships, and then add the first number series in the relevant relationship to the relevant setup page. Then, when a user creates a customer, they choose the relevant template, and the new customer gets a number assigned from the number series that is defined for that template.  

## To create relationships between number series

If you set up more than one number series for the same kind of information or transactions, you can create relationships between the series. This feature can help you decide among the codes when you use a number. When you set up a relationship between a group of number series, you associate all of the related series to one number series. Then, you can enter that code in a field on the **Numbering** FastTab on setup pages, such as **Sales & Receivables Setup**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the number series you want to create relationships for and then choose **Relationships**.
3. In the **Series Code** field, enter the code for the number series that you want to relate to the series you selected in step 2.
4. Add a line for each code that you want to relate to the selected number series.
5. Close the page.

Now when you set up something that requires a number, you can use the relationships you created to select among the related number series.

## To set up where a number series is used

The following procedure shows how to set up number series for the Sales area. The steps are similar for other areas.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, select the desired number series for each sales card or document.

The selected number now fills in the **No.** field on the card or document according to your settings.

# Work with Production Families

A production family is a group of individual items whose relationship is based on the similarity of their manufacturing processes. By forming production families, some items can be manufactured twice or more in one production, which will optimize material consumption.

In the **Quantity** field on the **Family** page, you enter the quantity that will be produced when the whole family has been manufactured once.

## Example

In punching processes, four pieces of the same item can be produced from one sheet and 10 pieces of another, different, item at the same time. The punching machine will punch all 14 pieces in one step.

Forming production families reduces the scrap quantity because what would normally be leftover scrap, when producing big pieces, will be used instead to produce small items.

## To set up a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Families**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To produce based on a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new production order. For more information, see [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. In the **Source Type** field, select **Family**.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the relevant production family.

# Record consumption or usage for projects

From the **Project Card** page, you can open the **Project Planning Lines** page to review and record use on various parts of your project. This information is automatically updated when you modify and transfer information between projects and project journals or project invoices. This requires that you turn on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Project Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

For example, for planning lines of type **Budget**, you can enter the quantity of a resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to the project journal. If the type of the planning line is **Billable**, you can enter the quantity of the resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to an invoice. To learn more about invoicing the customer, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md). By comparing the original quantity, remaining quantity, or posted quantity you can quickly review use information. To learn more about how to estimate budgeted values during planning, go to [Manage Project Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).  

The following procedures describe how to record actual (budgeted) quantities and costs with a project journal. Alternatively, you can use purchase documents to record purchases for a project. Learn more at [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md).

## To record usage for a project planning line of type Budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. 
3. Select a project planning line of type **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable** for which you want to record usage.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also record usage for a project planning line of type **Billable**. Typically, you use these lines to create invoices, but you can also transfer the information to a journal. Learn more at [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) 

4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** field, enter the quantity to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the project and transfer to the journal.
5. Choose the **Create Project Journal Lines** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more project planning lines for this project, wait with this step until you have added all project planning lines.
6. On the **Project Transfer Project Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **Open Project Journal** action.  
8. On the **Project Journal** page, select the relevant line and then choose the **Post** action.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

9. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, review the recorded usage by observing the **Quantity**, **Remaining Quantity**, and **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** fields.  
10. Repeat steps 3 through 8 to record additional usage.  

## To create project journal lines manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose a relevant project journal batch.  
3. On a new line, enter document number, project number, project task number, type, and the quantity of the type being consumed.  
4. When the project journal lines are complete, choose the **Post** action.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view project usage estimates and post updates

You can view project usage up to the completion of a project in one step. To do so, you use the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** batch job for all the tasks up to and including the end of a project.  

This lets you track and compare your original estimates against actual results and make modifications or new entries as needed. For example, you may have estimated that a project required 10 hours, and to date, it has taken 15 hours. You can add the extra five hours to the existing journal line or create a new journal line to report these five hours as overtime, which is another work type. The appropriate cost and price are calculated, and you can then post to the journal.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries create item ledger entries and reduce the inventory quantity. The **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job transfers the cost from inventory to the general ledger. Resource entries create resource ledger entries.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
3. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, enter the document number and posting date that is to be inserted in the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. Update the journal with any modifications that may be needed.  
5. Choose the **Post**.

## Create inventory and warehouse pick documents for a project

Use the **Create Inventory Pick** and **Create Warehouse Pick** actions on the **Project Card** page. To create or register a pick document, use the **Put-away/Pick Lines/Movement Lines** or **Registered Pick Lines** actions. Learn more at [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Projects](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can use the actions under the following conditions:

* The **Status** of the project is **Open**.
* The **Line Type** of the project planning line is **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable**.
* The **Type** of the project planning line is **Item**.
* **Require Pick** is enabled for the related location.
* **Directed Pick and Put-away** is disabled.

> [!NOTE] 
> Although the setting is called **Require Pick**, you can still post consumption directly from the project journal line for the location. If your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to organize and print the picking information. You also use the page to enter and post the result of the pick, which in turn posts the consumption of the items. 
> 
> If your location is set up to require both pick and shipment processing, meaning that you have chosen both the **Require Pick** and **Require Shipment** fields on the **Location Card** page, use the **Warehouse Pick** page to handle the pick. Warehouse picks are similar to inventory picks. The difference is that rather than posting the picking information you register the pick. This registration doesn't post consumption, it just makes the items available for posting. As a warehouse manager, you can use a pick worksheet to organize pick information before creating the individual warehouse pick instructions

## To review planning lines for a project ledger entry

After you have posted project journal lines, you can see the planning lines that are associated with the project journal entries that have been posted.

> [!NOTE]  
> This requires that the **Apply Usage Link** check box has been selected for the project. For more information, see [Set up projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, choose **Show Linked Project Planning Lines** action.

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

## External document number

# Design Details: Transfers in Planning

Transfer orders are also a source of supply when working at the SKU level. When using multiple locations (warehouses), the SKU replenishment system can be set to Transfer, implying that the location is replenished by transferring goods from another location. In a situation with more warehouses, you might have a chain of transfers. Supply to GREEN location is transferred from YELLOW, supply to YELLOW is transferred from RED, and so on. In the beginning of the chain, there's a replenishment system of **Prod. Order** or **Purchase**.  

![Example of transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers1.png "Example of transfer flow")  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

If you compare the following situations, it's clear that the planning task in the latter can become complex:

* A supply order is directly facing a demand order
* A sales order is supplied through a chain of SKU transfers

If demand changes, it might cause a ripple effect through the chain. All transfer orders, plus the purchase and production order in the opposite end of the chain, will have to be updated to re-balance demand and supply.  

![Example of supply/demand balance in transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers2.png "Example of supply/demand balance in transfers")  

## Why is a transfer a special case?  

Transfer orders are similar to other orders, such as purchase and production orders. However, behind the scene they're different.  

One difference is that a transfer line represents both demand and supply. The outbound part that's shipped is demand. The inbound part that's received at the new location is supply at that location.  

![Content of the Transfer Order page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers3.png "Content of the Transfer Order page")  

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the supply side of the transfer, it must make a similar change on the demand side.  

## Transfers are dependent demand  

The demand and supply relationship is similar to components on production order lines. The difference is that components on production order lines are on the next planning level, and have a different item. The two parts of the transfer are on the same level for the same item.  

An important similarity is that components and transfers are dependent demand. Demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer. If the supply changes, the demand is directly affected.

Unless the planning flexibility is None, a transfer line shouldn't be treated as independent demand in planning.  

In the planning procedure, the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the planning system has processed the supply side. Before that processing happens, the actual demand isn't known. The sequence of changes is important for transfer orders.  

## Planning sequence  

The following image shows an example of a string of transfers.  

![Example of simple transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers4.png "Example of simple transfer flow")  

In this example, a customer orders the item at location GREEN. Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED. The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE.  

In this example, the planning system starts at the customer demand and works its way back through the chain. The demands and supplies are processed for one location at a time.  

![Supply planning with transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers5.png "Supply planning with transfers")  

## Transfer level code  

The transfer level code of the SKU determines the sequence in which the planning system processes locations.  

The transfer level code is an internal field. The field is calculated and stored on the SKU when you create or modify the SKU. The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of item and item variant. The calculation uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route to use for the SKUs. The calculation ensures that all demands are processed.  

The transfer level code will be 0 for SKUs with Purchase or Prod. Order replenishment system, and will be -1 for the first transfer level, -2 for the second, and so on. In the example described in the previous section, the levels would be -1 for RED and -2 for GREEN, as shown in the following illustration.  

![Content of SKU Card page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers6.gif "Content of SKU Card page")  

When updating a SKU, the planning system detects whether replenishment systems for SKUs have circular references.  

## Planning transfers without SKU  

For less advanced warehouse setups, you can use locations and make manual transfers between locations, even if you don't use SKUs. For example, the transfer might cover a sales order at that location. The planning system reacts to changes in the demand.  

For manual transfers, the planning system analyzes transfer orders and then plans the order in which to process the locations. Internally, the planning system uses temporary SKUs that have transfer level codes.  

![Transfer level code.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers7.png "Transfer level code")  

If there are several transfers to a location, the first transfer order defines the planning direction. Transfers in the opposite direction are canceled.  

## Changing quantity with reservations  

When changing quantities on a supply, the planning system takes reservations into account. The reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much to reduce the supply.  

When you change the quantity on a transfer order line, keep the lower limit in mind. The lower limit is the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer lines.

For example, a transfer order line of 117 pieces is reserved for the following lines:

* A sales line of 46
* A purchase line of 24

Even though the inbound side might have excess supply, you can't reduce the transfer line below 46.  

![Reservations in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers8.png "Reservations in transfer planning")  

## Changing quantity in a transfer chain  

Here's an example of what happens when you change a quantity in a transfer change.

The starting point is a balanced situation with a transfer chain supplying a sales order of 27 at location RED. There's a corresponding purchase order at location BLUE. Both transfers go through location PINK. There are two transfer orders, BLUE-PINK and PINK-RED.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers9.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1")  

Now, the planner at the PINK location chooses to reserve for the purchase.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers10.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2")  

The reservation usually means that the planning system ignores the purchase order and transfer demand. There isn't a problem long as there's balance. But what happens when the RED location changes the order from 27 to 22?  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers11.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3")  

When the planning system runs again, it should get rid of excess supply. However, the reservation locks the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers12.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4")  

The PINK-RED transfer has been reduced to 22. The inbound part of the BLUE-PINK transfer isn't reserved, but the outbound part is. The reservation means that you can't reduce the quantity below 27.  

## Lead time calculation  

When calculating the due date of a transfer order, different kinds of lead time are taken into account.  

The following lead times are active when planning a transfer order:  

* Outbound warehouse handling time  
* Shipping time  
* Inbound warehouse handling time  

On the planning line, the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation:  

* Transfer shipment date  
* Starting date  
* Ending date  
* Due date  

The shipment date of the transfer line is shown in the **Transfer Shipment Date** field. The receipt date of the transfer line is shown in the **Due Date** field.  

The starting and ending dates describe the actual transportation period.  

The following image shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines for transfer orders.  

![Central date-times in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers13.png "Central date-times in transfer planning")  

The example shows the following calculations:  

* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date  
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date  
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date  

## Safety lead time  

The **Default Safety Lead Time** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page and the related **Safety Lead Time** field on the **Item Card** page aren't included in transfer order calculations. However, the safety lead time does influence the total plan. The safety lead time affects the replenishment order (purchase or production) at the beginning of the transfer chain. That's the point where the items were put in the location from which they'll be transferred.  

![Elements of the transfer due date.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers14.png "Elements of the transfer due date")  

On the production order line, the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date.  

On the purchase order line, the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.  

## Reschedule  

When you reschedule a transfer line, the planning system finds the outbound part and changes the date-time.

> [!NOTE]
> If a lead time is defined, there'll be a gap between the shipment and the receipt. The lead time can consist of more elements, such as transportation time and warehouse handling time. On a time line, the planning system moves back in time while it balances the elements.  

![Changing the due date in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers15.png "Changing the due date in transfer planning")  

When you change the due date on a transfer line, the lead time must be calculated to update the outbound side of the transfer.  

## Serial and lot numbers in transfer chains  

If the demand uses serial or lot numbers, and you run the planning engine, it will create transfer orders. For more information about this concept, see Item Attributes. However, if serial or lot numbers are removed from the demand, the transfer orders still use the serial or lot numbers and planning will ignore them (not deleted).  

## Order-to-order links  

In this example, the BLUE SKU is set up with an **Order** reordering policy. The PINK and RED SKUs have the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy. Creating a sales order for 27 at location RED leads to a chain of transfers. The last transfer is at location BLUE, and it's reserved with binding. In this example, the reservations aren't hard reservations created by the planner at PINK location. The planning system creates the bindings. The important difference is that the planning system can change the latter.  

![Order-to-order links in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers16.png "Order-to-order links in transfer planning")  

If the demand is changed from 27 to 22, the planning system will lower the quantity through the chain. The binding reservation is also reduced.

# Why a Page is Locked from Personalization

There are two conditions that prevent you from personalizing a page. Either the page is locked (as indicated by the ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock")) icon or it's blocked (as indicated by the ![Personalization blocked.](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon).

## Locked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page, you're currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

<!-- This is because we changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalization changes that you made. If you want to continue personalizing the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
-->

There can be two reasons:

1. You've personalized the page before, but it was done using an earlier version of the product. We changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new way of doing things don't work together.

2. Until now, you've only used the bow deprecated [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

### Unlocking the Page

If you want to unlock a page and continue personalizing it, choose the ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon, and then choose the **Unlock** action.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The current personalization of the page will be cleared. The page will go back to its original layout, and you'll have to start from scratch.  

## Blocked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon in the **Personalizing** banner, you're blocked from doing any personalization to the page.

<!-- Only text is translated, so removing this image for non-English UX reasons.  ![Personalize blocked.](media/personalization-blocked.png "Personalize lock") -->

The reason is that the Role Center or role that is currently associated with your user account modifies this page specifically for your role. Contact your administrator for assistance. Alternatively, try switching to a Role Center that does include role-tailoring for this page. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

# Design details: Non-deductible VAT

Non-deductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser, but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, you must contact the local tax authorities in your country or region to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible. Even when you know that a specific percentage of the VAT isn't deductible, there are different models for handling non-deductible amounts as they are related to **items** and **fixed assets**.

## Prerequisites for using non-deductible VAT

To use and post non-deductible VAT, follow these steps.

1. On the **VAT Setup** page, select **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to enable the feature.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select which VAT posting groups can use non-deductible VAT.

## Examples

For the following examples, non-deductible VAT is enabled, and the following setup is completed:

- The **VAT Product Posting Group** field is set to **NDVAT**.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup** page:

    - **NDVAT** is set as the VAT product posting group, and **DOMESTIC** is set as the VAT business posting group.
    - The **VAT Identifier** value must be unique.
    - The **VAT %** field is set to **25**.
    - The **Allow Non-deductible VAT** field is set to **Allow**.
    - The **Non-deductible VAT %** field is set to **100**.
    - The **VAT Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**.
    - Only the sales VAT account and purchase VAT account are configured.

All the examples use items and fixed assets where the VAT product posting group is **NDVAT**.

### Items

A new item has **NDVAT** set as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Value Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Item Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Item Cost isn't enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,000.00 | 1 |

#### Use for Item Cost is enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,250.00 | 1 |

### Fixed assets

A new fixed asset has the acquisition cost account set to use **NDVAT** as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Fixed Asset Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost isn't enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost is enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 250.00 | 0.00 |

# Work with assembly BOMs

You use assembly bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from components with little to no resource use. An assembly BOM can be used, for example, to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of component items.

Use assembly orders to make finished items from components in a process that one or more basic resources can perform, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity on an assembly order, the assembly order lines are filled in according to the assembly BOM. The order has one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports production BOMs. Production BOMs differ from assembly BOMs because they involve more complex procedures, such as resource usage, production routing, and work or machine centers. Learn more about the differences at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) and [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## To create an assembly BOM

To define an item that consists of other items, and perhaps the resources that assemble the item, you must create an assembly BOM.  

Assembly BOMs can have multiple levels, which means that a component on the assembly BOM can be an assembly item itself. In that case, the **Assembly BOM** field on the assembly BOM line contains **Yes**.

Special requirements apply to items on assembly BOMs regarding availability. Learn more at [To see the availability of an item by its use in assembly BOMs](inventory-how-availability-overview.md#to-view-the-availability-of-an-item-by-its-use-in-assembly-or-production-boms).

There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM:

- Setting up a new item.
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item.

1. Set up a new item. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

   Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM.  
2. On the **Item Card** page for an assembly item, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Assembly items can have variants, just like any other item, which helps you keep your list of products shorter. Learn more about the feature at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).

## To edit assembly BOMs

You can edit the lines on an assembly BOM at any time. However, the BOM might be in use by ongoing sales or assemblies of the parent. Changing the BOM might affect those activities. Choose the **Where-Used** action to explore the items that use it and whether sales or assembly orders might be affected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Yes** value in the **Assembly BOM** column.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Edit List** action, then change any field as needed.

## To view components and resources indented according to the BOM structure

From the **Assembly BOM** page, you can open a separate page that shows the components and any resources indented according to their BOM position under the assembly item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Show BOM** action.

## To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines

From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item, you can use a special action to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components. This action is useful, for example, if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item.

The **Explode BOM** action is also available on the **Assembly BOM** page as a way to view subassembly items on an assembly BOM.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you have used the **Explode BOM** action, you can't easily undo it. You must delete the sales order lines for the components and then reenter a sales order line for the assembly item.

The following procedure is based on a sales invoice. The same steps apply to other sales documents and all purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item.
3. Choose the line for an assembly item, then **Explode BOM** line action.

All fields on the sales invoice line for the assembly item are cleared except for the **Item** and **Description** fields. Complete sales invoice lines are inserted for the components and possible resources that comprise the assembly item.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Picking List by Order** report is also changed to show the components only. This means that a warehouse worker picking the parent item, the assembly item, will not see it in the picking list. Learn more at [Print the Picking List](sales-how-print-picking-list.md).

## To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item

You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item's assembly BOM.

The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components, including other assembly BOMs, and any resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Calc. Standard Cost** action.
5. Select one of the following options, then choose the **OK** button.

|Option |Description |
|-------|------------|
|**Top Level**|Calculates the assembly item's standard cost as the total cost of all purchased or assembled items on that assembly BOM regardless of any underlying assembly BOMs.|
|**All Levels**|Calculates the assembly's item standard cost as the sum of:</br></br>* The calculated cost of all underlying assembly BOMs on the assembly BOM.</br>* The cost of all purchased items on the assembly BOM.|

The costs of the items that make up the assembly BOM are copied from the component item cards. The cost of each item is multiplied by the quantity, and the total cost is shown in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).

# Design Details: Revaluation

You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value. You can also backdate a revaluation to correctly update the cost of goods sold (COGS) for items you've already sold. Items that use the Standard costing method and aren't completely invoiced can also be revalued.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following flexibility is supported regarding revaluation:  

- The revaluable quantity can be calculated for any date, also back in time.  
- For items using Standard costing method, expected cost entries are included in revaluation.  
- Inventory decreases affected by revaluation are detected.  

## Calculate the revaluable quantity

The quantity you can revalue is the remaining inventory that's available on a given date. The quantity is the total of completely invoiced item ledger entries that you post on or before the revaluation date.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Items using the Standard costing method are treated differently when calculating the revaluable quantity per item, location, and variant. The quantities and values of item ledger entries that are not completely invoiced are included in the revaluable quantity.  

After a revaluation has been posted, you can post an inventory increase or decrease with a posting date that comes before the revaluation posting date. However, this quantity will not be affected by the revaluation. To balance the inventory, only the original revaluable quantity is considered.  

Because you can revaluate on any date, you must have conventions for when you consider an item as part of inventory. For example, when the item is on inventory and when the item is work in process (WIP).  

### Example  

The following example illustrates when a WIP item transitions to become part of inventory. The example is based on the production of a chain with 150 links.  

![WIP inventory and revaluation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_10_revaluation_wip.png "WIP inventory and revaluation")  

**1Q**: The user posts the purchased links as received. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|LINK|Purchase|150|1|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Now an item using the Standard costing method is available for revaluation.  

**1V**: The user posts the purchased links as invoiced and the links become part of inventory, from a financial point of view. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|1|1|  

 **2Q + 2V**: The user posts the purchased links as consumed for the production of the iron chain. From a financial point of view, the links become part of WIP inventory.  The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|LINK|Consumption|-150|1|  

The following table shows the resulting value entry.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  

The valuation date is set to the date of the consumption posting (02-01-20), as a regular inventory decrease.  

**3Q**: The user posts the chain as output and finishes the production order. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-15-20|CHAIN|Output|1|3|  

**3V**: The user runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which posts the chain as invoiced to indicate that all material consumption has been completely invoiced. From a financial point of view, the links are no longer part of WIP inventory when the output is completely invoiced and adjusted. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|2|2|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  
|02-15-20|Direct Cost|02-15-20|150.00|3|3|  

## Expected cost in revaluation

The quantity you can revalue is the sum of the quantity for completely invoiced item ledger entries that you posted on or before the revaluation date. When some items are received or shipped but not invoiced, you can't calculate their inventory value. Items that use the Standard costing method are not limited in this way.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Another type of expected cost that can be revalued is WIP inventory, within certain rules. For more information, see [WIP Inventory Revaluation](design-details-revaluation.md#wip-inventory-revaluation).  

When you calculate the revaluable quantity for items that use the Standard costing method, the calculation includes item ledger entries that aren't completely invoiced. These entries are revalued when you post the revaluation. When you invoice the revalued entry, you create the following value entries:  

- The usual invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**. The cost amount on this entry is the direct cost from the source line.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Variance**. This entry records the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation**. This entry records the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.

### Example  

The following example is based on the production of the chain in the previous example. This example illustrates how the three types of entries are created, based on the following scenario:  

1.  You post the purchased links as received with a unit cost of LCY 2.00.  
2.  You post a revaluation of the links with a new unit cost of LCY 3.00, updating the standard cost to LCY 3.00.  
3.  You post the original purchase of the chain links as invoiced, which creates the following value entries:  

    1.  An invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**.  
    2.  A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation** to record the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.  
    3.  A value entry with an entry type of Variance, recording the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  

The following table shows the results.  

|Step|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|1.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|300.00|0.00|1|1|  
|2.|01-20-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|150.00|0.00|1|2|  
|3.a.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|-300.00|0.00|1|3|  
|3.b.|01-15-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|-150.00|0.00|1|4|  
|3.c.|01-15-20|Variance|01-15-20|0.00|450.00|1|5|  

## Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease  

Use the date of the posting or the revaluation to determine whether an inventory decrease is affected by a revaluation.  

The following table shows the criteria that's used for an item that doesn't use the Average costing method.  

|Scenario|Entry No.|Timing|Affected by revaluation|  
|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|  
|A|Earlier than revaluation entry number|Earlier than revaluation posting date|No|  
|B|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|No|  
|C|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|D|Later than revaluation entry no.|Earlier than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|E|Later than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|F|Later than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  

### Example  

The following example illustrates revaluation of an item that uses the FIFO costing method. The example is based on the following scenario:  

1.  On 01-01-20, you post a purchase of 6 units.  
2.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
3.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
4.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
5.  On 03-01-20, you calculate the inventory value for the item, and post a revaluation of the item’s unit cost from LCY 10.00 to LCY 8.00.  
6.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
7.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
8.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
9. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Scenario|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
||01-01-20|Purchase|01-01-20|6|60.00|1|1|  
||03-01-20|Revaluation|03-01-20|4|-8.00|1|5|

## WIP inventory revaluation  

Revaluating WIP inventory implies that you revalue components that are registered as WIP inventory.  

It's important to have conventions that control when an item is WIP inventory from a financial point of view. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following conventions exist:  

- A purchased component becomes part of the raw material inventory when you post a purchase as invoiced.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component becomes part of the WIP inventory when you post its consumption with a production order.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component remains part of the WIP inventory until you invoice a production order (manufactured item).  

The way the valuation date for the value entry of consumption is set follows the same rules as for non-WIP inventory. To learn more, go to [Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease](#determine-whether-revaluation-affects-an-inventory-decrease).  

You can revalue WIP inventory under the following conditions:

- The revaluation date is before the posting dates of the corresponding item ledger entries of type Consumption.
- You haven't invoiced the production order.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** report shows the value of posted production order entries, and might be a little confusing for revalued WIP items.  

## Revaluate items with the Average costing method

You can only revaluate items that use the Average costing method if **Calculate Per** is *Item*.

You can only do revaluation at the end of the period selected in the **Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

Revaluation won't affect negative transactions in the current month, which is why fully applied inbound entries aren't included either.

### Example

This example shows what happens when you calculate the inventory value on the **Item Revaluation Journal** page. On the **Inventory Setup** page, **Item** is chosen in the **Average Cost Calc. Type** field, and **Month** is chosen in the **Average Cost Period** field.

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
25-04-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Purchase|3|3.00|2
27-04-23|Sale|-5|-5.00|3
28-04-23|Sale|-1|-1.00|4
13-05-23|Purchase|2|20.00|5
17-06-23|Sale|-6|-22.00|6

The following table shows the result of running the **Calculate Inventory Value** report with different posing dates.

|Posting Date|Quantity|Comment|
|---|---|-------------|
30-04-23|2|Includes only the remaining quantity from entry 2. Entry 1 is completely applied before the posting date, and entry 5 is after posting date.
31-05-23|4|Includes the remaining quantities from entries 2 and 13.
30-06-23|0|No remaining quantity at posting date.

The result of the following entries will be 0, regardless of the posting date.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
13-05-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Sale|-5|5.00|2

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.

## To correct a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# Design details: accounts in the general ledger

To reconcile inventory and capacity ledger entries with the general ledger, the related value entries are posted to different accounts in the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## From the Inventory Ledger  

The following table shows the relationship between different types of inventory value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger.  

|**Item Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Variance Type**|**Expected Cost**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||Yes|Inventory  (Interim)|Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|Direct Cost Applied|  
|Purchase|Indirect Cost||No|Inventory|Overhead Applied|  
|Purchase|Variance|Purchase|No|Inventory|Purchase Variance|  
|Purchase|Revaluation||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Purchase|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Sale|Direct Cost||Yes|Inventory  (Interim)|COGS (Interim)|  
|Sale|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|COGS|

|(Production) Consumption|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|WIP|  
|(Production) Consumption|Revaluation||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|(Production) Consumption|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Assembly Consumption|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Assembly Consumption|Direct Cost||No|Direct Cost Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|

|(Production) Output|Variance|Manufacturing Overhead|No|Inventory|Mfg. Overhead Variance|  
|(Production) Output|Revaluation||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|(Production) Output|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|

|Assembly Output|Variance|Material|No|Inventory|Material Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Variance|Capacity|No|Inventory|Capacity Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Variance|Capacity Overhead|No|Inventory|Cap. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Variance|Manufacturing Overhead|No|Inventory|Mfg. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  

## From the Capacity Ledger  

 The following table shows the relationship between different types of capacity value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger. Capacity ledger entries represent labor time consumed in assembly or production work.  

|**Work Type**|**Capacity Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Assembly|Resource|Direct Cost|Direct Cost Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Assembly|Resource|Indirect Cost|Overhead Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Direct Cost|WIP Account|Direct Cost Applied|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Indirect Cost|WIP Account|Overhead Applied|  

## Assembly costs are always actual  

 As shown in the table above, assembly postings are not represented in interim accounts. This is because the concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly output posting, unlike in production output posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Calculating the amount to post to the general ledger  

 The following fields in the **Value Entry** table are used to calculate the expected cost amount that is posted to the general ledger:  

- Cost Amount (Actual)  
- Cost Posted to G/L  
- Cost Amount (Expected)  
- Expected Cost Posted to G/L  

The following table shows how the amounts to post to the general ledger are calculated for the two different cost types.  

|Cost Type|Calculation|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Actual Cost|Cost Amount (Actual) – Cost Posted to G/L|  
|Expected Cost|Cost Amount (Expected) –  Expected Cost Posted to G/L|

# Period-Over-Period Growth (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period Growth** report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. The report compares sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, providing insight into growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the sales amount in September 2023 to the sales amount in September 2022. If the analysis scope is fiscal years, the report compares the sales amount in fiscal year 2023 to the sale amount in fiscal year 2022.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Previous Period**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pp-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop-fiscal)

## How to use the report

The report helps purchase and finance teams to track actual spending against budgets.

CEOs can easily track and analyze the purchasing performance of your organization against your budget to ensure that you're meeting your financial goals. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the entire organization's purchasing performance, helping you make informed decisions when you manage your budget. With this report, you can identify areas where your organization is overspending or underspending, and adjust your purchasing budget accordingly.

# Set Up Pricing and Additional Costs for Services
You can use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pricing features to set up and customize your application so that you apply and adjust pricing on service items, repairs, and orders. These pricing decisions are then easily transmitted to the invoicing process.  
  
As your implementation requires, you can set up pricing groups and map them to specific time periods, customers, or currency. You can set up fixed, minimum, or maximum pricing, depending on the service contracts that you have with customers. Finally, as you adjust your prices, you can view and approve the changes before committing them to the ledger.  

## To set up a service price group
You can set up groups containing service items that you want to receive the same special service pricing. You assign service price groups to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. Choose the **Setup** action.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

 > [!Tip]
 > The **Adjustment Type** and **Amount** fields work together to specify whether an adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or applies only when the total service price exceeds or is lower than the amount in the **Amount** field.  

## To set up a service price adjustment group  
You can set up price adjustment groups to adjust service pricing of service items. For example, you can set up price adjustment groups that adjust price of freight or spare parts.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Adjustment Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price adjustment group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the entry that you want to adjust.  
  
    * To adjust only one specific entry, enter the number of this entry in the **No.** field. When you leave this field blank, your adjustment group will adjust all entries of the type defined in the **Type** field.  
    * To adjust service prices related to only one specific service, fill in the **Work Type** field. When you leave this field blank, it will just be ignored.  
  
5. In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the service price adjustment.  
6. To adjust service prices related to only one specific general product posting group, fill in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field.

> [!Tip]
> You can choose **Details** to add additional information about the adjustment group. For example, you can specify which item belongs to the service price adjustment group, and whether this is an item, a resource, a resource group, or a service charge.  

## To set up additional costs for services
When you work with service items and service orders, you may need to register additional costs, such as travel costs to particular service zones or starting fees. When you create a service order, you can insert these costs and a line with the type **Cost** will be added to the order. Alternatively, if you want to apply the cost to all service orders, you can set up a default cost. For example, if you always want to apply a starting fee.
  
### To set up service costs
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Costs**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To specify a default cost for service orders
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Service Order Starting Fee** field, choose the appropriate service cost.

# Finding pages and information with Tell Me

This article describes how the in-product search, *Tell me what you want to do*, can help you: 

* Quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports.
* Search for specific data, either on a list page or in all of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Find [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation about a subject you're interested in.

<!-- ![!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048] -->

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start a search.

When you start typing characters on the **Tell me what you want to do** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word *product* and the results include *items*, that's because search uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it opens a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell me what you want to do** page, the **exploring pages and reports** action opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

The **Tell me what you want to do** page categorizes results based on the data that you enter and the page you're working on. The following sections describe the categories.

## Find an action on the current page

The **On current page** section lets you find actions on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the Customer Card page for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs aren't included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer pages and tasks than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. Learn more about user experiences in [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find a record or search the documentation

The **Search for \<keyword\>** section [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple of ways to search:

* Use the **Search company data** action to search all pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about how the company data search works in [Search for a record in company data](ui-search-data.md).
* Use the **Search Help** action to find an article in the Business Central documentation that contains your keyword.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Your search results won't include documentation for third-party extensions.

### Use Tell me what you want to do

Use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you can find a customer by entering their name or address, or even find a specific record, such as a sales order. You can also use it to find information in our documentation.

Just enter at least three characters of a keyword, and then choose either **Search company data** or **Search Help**.

* If you search for data, results display on the **Search in company data** page, where they're sorted by type.  
* If you search in our Help, the **Help** pane offers links to articles that contain your keywords. You'll also get a snippet from the article that can help you decide whether it's what you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> For data, searching everything in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might take time. To speed up results, use the **Show tables to search** action to choose the tables and fields that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Use search on list pages

It isn't related to Tell me what you want to do, but there's another way to search for specific data. When you're using a list page, you can use the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** field in the left corner of list page headers to search for data on the page. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. Learn more about working with data on list pages in [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#searching).  

> [!TIP]
> You can search for posted document lines, such as invoice lines, credit memo lines, shipment lines, and receipt lines. Search for the type of document lines that you want to find, and then bookmark the links to the documents on your home page for easy access to the original or a filtered view. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

## Questions?

We've shown search to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list of frequently asked questions. If you're interested, go to [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).

# Invoice sales

You can usually create either a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.  

However, you must use a sales order instead of a sales invoice if you:  

* Need to ship only part of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't on hand.  
* Ship products after you post the corresponding sales invoices.
* Sell items your vendor delivers directly to your customer, known as drop shipment. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).  

In all other situations, sales orders and sales invoices work in the same way. Learn more about how to use sales orders at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice when you agree on the sale. Learn more at [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).

## Create sales invoices

If the customer decides to buy, you post the sales invoice to create the related quantity and value entries. When you post the sales invoice, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the invoice and payment information, such as providing a link to PayPal. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email). When the customer pays the invoice, you can register that payment in different ways, depending on the size and preferred workflows of your organization. Learn more at [Registering Payments](#register-payments) section.  

Item cards can be of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type to specify if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit, or a physical unit not kept on inventory, respectively. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The sales invoice process is the same for all three item types.

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in one of two ways, depending on whether the customer is already registered. See step 2 in the following procedure.

### To create a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer. If, however, the customer is new and therefore not registered, follow these steps to populate standard customer information on the **Sales Invoice** page:

    1. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of the new customer.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new customer, choose **OK**.
    3. On the **Select a template for a new customer** page, choose a template to base the new customer card on, then choose **OK**.
    4. A new customer card displays the information on the selected customer template. Fill in the remaining fields. Learn more at [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  
    5. When you complete the customer card, choose **Close** to return to the **Sales Invoice** page.

   Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by cash or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales invoice. If you select *Cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the **Lines** FastTab with products you're selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer you want to record in a general ledger (G/L) account.

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select the type of product, charge, or transaction you post for the customer on the sales line.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you've set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can reflect that in the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field blank in the following cases:

    * If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. Learn more at [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction the line should record for the customer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item is of the **Service** type, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. Learn more at [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* × *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, and upon meeting the price criteria, the price and amount on the sales line is automatically updated. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated, as you create or modify lines, to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In very rare cases, the posted amounts may deviate from what is displayed in the totals fields. This is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to VAT or sales tax.<br /><br />To verify the amounts you’ll post, use the **Customer Statistics** FactBox. Also, when you choose the **Release** action, the values in the totals fields will update to include rounding calculations.

9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the discount criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

10. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. Learn more at [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system, and the sales invoice is output as a PDF document. The sales invoice is removed from the list of sales invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales invoices.  

### Calculate invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the final payment. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md). If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo to reverse the sale. Learn more at [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

[Open the **Posted Sales Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Register payments

Depending on your business needs, you can get paid and register a payment in different ways: manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

You can process the payments straight from the customer card. Use the **Register Customer Payments** action to get an overview of unpaid invoices for that customer. Then, mark the invoice as paid partially or in full. This payment reconciliation processes your customer payments by matching amounts received in your bank account with the related unpaid sales invoices, and then posts the payments. Learn more in the [To reconcile payments individually](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-register-customer-payments-individually) section.  

In business environments where the customer pays some time after delivery. According to the payment terms, a posted sales invoice remains open (unpaid) until the Accounts Receivable department verifies the payment, and applies it to the posted sales invoice. This can be done manually or automatically. Learn more at [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md) and [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).  

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, payment is recorded immediately when you post the sales invoice, which means the posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the relevant method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. Learn more at [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid invoices for unregistered customers by setting up a "cash customer" card for them, which you point to on the sales invoice. Learn more at [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you need to first set up reminder levels and terms. Learn more at [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

# Personalize your workspace

You can personalize your workspace to suit your work and preferences. Change pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. Personalization affects only your workspace. It doesn't change how others work. You can personalize all types of pages, including the [role center](ui-change-basic-settings.md#role-center) page.

The adjustments outlined in this article are applied universally across all your devices and browsers. There are other modifications, not detailed here, that only affect the specific device and browser on which they're made. Learn more about the differences in [Where is personalization stored?](ui-personalization-stored.md).

## Video and training

The following video shows some of the ways in which you can personalize your Role Center.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=d76e5d60-ecc2-462b-bba2-18d6deee3534]

For online training, go to [Personalize the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central user interface](/training/modules/personalize-ui-dynamics-365-business-central/).

## About personalization

You can make various adjustments, such as move or hide fields, columns, actions, and entire parts, and add new fields. You do most adjustments by first activating the **Personalizing** banner using the [personalization mode](#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode). You can also readily make the following adjustments on any list page without using the personalization mode:

- [Resize a column](#resize-a-column)
- [Create, rename, or edit a view](ui-views.md)
- [Bookmark the page](ui-bookmarks.md)
- [Hide or resize a FactBox](#hide-or-resize-a-factbox)
- Expand/collapse hierarchical list

### Resize a column

There are two ways to change the width of a column in any list, including in dropdown lists for looking up field values:

- Select and drag the boundary between two columns in the header of a list.
- Double-click the boundary between two columns to autofit the width of the column. The width adjusts to the optimal size for readability.

### Hide or resize a FactBox

A FactBox is a pane along the right side of a page that displays more information related to the record on the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/factbox.png" alt-text="Shows the FactBox position in the web client":::

- To hide or show the FactBox, select the ![Shows the collapse or expand FactBox icon in Business Central](media/collapse-expand-factbox.png) **Collapse/Expand the FactBox pane** icon at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To resize the FactBox, drag the vertical divider between the FactBox and main content. Double-click the divider to reset the width to default.

   If you can't resize the FactBox, you're either using Business Central version earlier than 26.0, or **Feature: Optimize screen estate usage for web** isn't turned on in **Feature Management**. Contact your admin, or learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

## Start personalizing by using the personalization mode

1. Open any page that you want to personalize.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") and then choose the **Personalize** action.

    The **Personalizing** banner appears at the top to indicate that you can start making changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

    If you see **Personalize lock** ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") or **Personalization blocked** ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") on the banner, you can't personalize the page. For more information, see [Why a Page is Locked from Personalization](ui-personalization-locked.md).

1. To change a user interface (UI) element, point to the element, such as an action, a field, or a part. The element is immediately highlighted with an arrowhead or border. Choose the element, and then choose either **Move**, **Remove**, **Hide**, **Show**, **Show under "Show more"**, **Show when collapsed**, **Show always**, **Set/Clear Freeze Pane**, or **Include/Exclude from Quick Entry**, depending on the type and state of the UI element.
1. To add a field, choose the **+ Field** action. From the **Add Field to Page** pane, drag and drop a field into the desired position on the page.
1. When you finish changing the layout of one or more pages, choose **Done** on the **Personalizing** banner.

For more information, see [What You Can Personalize](#What).

## <a name="Actions"></a>Personalize action bar and menus

Personalization lets you decide which actions to show on the navigation and action bars and on Role Centers, and where to show them. You can show, hide, or move individual actions or action groups.

The following video shows how you can personalize actions on pages and Role Centers.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=88d1055a-6b3d-4767-bbf7-98a78170e394]

Personalizing the navigation and action bars is done basically the same as with other UI elements. However, what you can do with an action or group depends on where the action or group is located. The best way to find out is to enter personalizing mode and then let the arrowheads guide you.

There are a couple of terms that you should be familiar with to better understand action personalization: *action group* and *promoted category*.  

An *action group* is an element that expands to display other actions or groups. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, one action group is the **Functions** action that appears when you choose the **Actions** action.

A *promoted category* is an action group that appears before the vertical line `|` on the action bar. The categories typically include the most commonly used actions, so that you can quickly find them. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, the **Order**, **Release**, and **Posting** actions are promoted categories.

> [!NOTE]  
> To clear personalization, select the arrowhead around the part's designer menu, and then choose **Clear personalization**.

### Remove, hide, and show actions and action groups

When you want to show or hide an action, the options under the arrowhead define what you can do depending on the action's state. 

1. Choose the arrowhead for an action or action group.
2. Choose from one of the following options:

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Remove**|This option appears if the selected action is also shown somewhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Choosing this option deletes the action from the selected location so that it no longer appears. The action or action group remains in the other locations. |
   |**Hide**|This option appears if the action or action group isn't located anywhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Like **Remove**, choosing this option makes the action or action group disappear from the navigation bar or action bar. However, in personalizing mode, the action, or action group is still shown in the current position, except that it appears dimmed.|
   |**Show**|This option appears if the action or action group is hidden (dimmed). Choosing this option makes the action or action group appear on the navigation bar or action bar.|

### Move actions and action groups

A horizontal line between two actions or a border around an action group indicates where you can drop actions or actions groups. There are the following limitations:

- You can move individual actions into the promoted categories, but you can't rearrange the order of the actions in the category.
- You can't move an action group into a promoted category.

To move an action or action group, drag and drop it into the desired position, like you do with fields and columns.

To move an action or action group into another action group that is empty, drag the action or action group to the new group and drop it in the **Drop an action here** box.

### About the Automate menu

- You can't hide or move the **Automate** menu or the **Power Automate** submenu and its actions.
- You can move flows included under the **Automate** item, but you can't hide them using personalization. Moving the flow makes a copy the flow in the destination, it doesn't remove it from the **Automate** item.

> [!TIP]
> As an administrator, you can hide the **Automation** item from users. Learn more at [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

## <a name="Parts"></a>Personalize parts

Hover over or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to get information about a field.

Parts are areas on a page that are typically composed of multiple fields, charts, or other content. A part shows a colored border when you focus on the part. For example, a Role Center home screen has multiple parts. Because of their well-defined boundary, you can personalize the entire part and its contents.

- To move a part, drag and drop it into the desired position. A colored line indicates valid positions on the screen. For example, FactBoxes can only be moved next to other FactBoxes in the FactBox pane.
- You can hide a part by choosing the **Hide** option under the arrowhead.
- When you start personalizing or navigate to a new page, any parts that are currently hidden appear on the page with distinctive visuals to indicate they're hidden. You can unhide that part by choosing the **Show** option under the arrowhead.

You can clear all personalization changes that you made within a single part by choosing the **Clear personalization** option under the part's arrowhead. Clearing personalization of a part only affects changes to the contents of the part. It doesn't affect the placement or visibility of the part on the page.  

## <a name="fields"></a> Work with fields and columns

When personalizing a page, you use the **Add field to page** pane to include fields or columns on the page that are currently hidden from view. To open this pane, select the **+ Field** action near the top of the page. Unlike other hidden elements, hidden fields aren't indicated on the page itself in personalization mode. However, you can identify hidden fields by using the **Add field to page** pane.

Here are some general guidelines to follow when using the **Add field to page** pane:

- By default, the pane lists all hidden fields. To find hidden fields, look for the ![Shows the hidden field icon](media/hidden-icon.png "Shows the hidden field icon") icon.
- You can filter the list to show other fields, for example, those fields currently shown on the page, by selecting the **Recommended fields** button above the list and choosing a filter option. The name of the button changes based on the filter option you choose.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/personlaization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the personalization mode.":::
- Selecting a field in the list highlights its location on the page. If the field is hidden, its location shows in a shaded state.
- To get more details about a field in the list, hover over it or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to display a tooltip.
- The fields available in the **Add field to page** pane are determined by the developer of the page and its source table or by a profile admin who [customized the page](ui-personalization-manage.md). You can't create new ones.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.

### Add a field so it's visible on the page

From the **Add field to page** pane, there are two ways to include a hidden field on the page:

- Drag the field to the desired position. A thick horizontal or vertical line indicates the target location.
- Select the field in the list, then go to the shaded field on the page and select the **Show** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Some fields that you add won't be editable on the page when you're done with personalization. These fields are either originally designed this way or an administrator [customized](ui-personalization-manage.md) the page to prevent you from editing them.

## Clear personalization

At some point, you might want to undo some or all of the personalization changes that you made to a page over time.

1. On the **Personalizing** banner, choose the **Clear personalization** action.
2. Choose one of the following options.  

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Clearing personalization can't be undone.

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Only Navigation Menu**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the navigation menu that is shared across the Role Center and other pages. Such changes include any new actions that were added as bookmarks, and any changes to links and groups in the menu.|  
   |**Only Actions**|Clears any personalization changes that you made on the navigation or action bars on the page.|
   |**Only Fields and Columns**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the page except changes on the navigation or action bars. Such changes include changes to fields, columns, parts, and tiles. |
   |**All**|Clears all personalization changes that you made to the page so it looks like it did originally. Such changes include changes to navigation and action bars, fields, columns, parts, and tiles.|

## Tips and other points of interest

To help you better understand personalization, here are some pointers:

- When you make changes to a card page that you open from a list, the changes take effect on all records that you open from that list. For example, let's say you open a specific customer from the Customers list page, and then personalize the page by adding a field. When you open other customers from the list, the field that you added is also shown.
- Changes that you make affect all your Role Centers. For example, if you make a change to the Customer list when the Role Center is set to Business Manager, you also see the change on the **Customers** page when the Role Center is set to Sales Order Processor.
- Changes to a page in a pane take effect on the page wherever it appears.  
- You can't personalize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you happen to switch to personalization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analysis mode is automatically switched off.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.
- If a part or group is hidden, ghosted fields still show inside it, but you can't drag-and-drop or add/show that field until you make the group/part visible.

> [!NOTE]

# Set Up Fixed Asset Insurance

To manage fixed asset insurance coverage, you must first set up some general insurance information and an insurance card per policy.

## To set up general insurance information

To use the insurance features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up some general insurance information.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Setups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up insurance types

You can group your insurance policies into categories, such as insurance against theft or fire insurance. The insurance types are used on the insurance card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance cards

You may accumulate information about each insurance policy on the insurance card.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Insurance** page, choose the **New** action to create a  new insurance card.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance journal templates

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates an insurance journal template the first time that you open the **Insurance Journal** page, but you can set up additional journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance journal batches

You can set up batches in an insurance journal template. The values in the journal batch are used as default values if the fields are not filled in on the journal lines. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an insurance journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **Insurance Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Numbers have a special function in journal names. If a journal template name or journal batch name contains a number, the number automatically advances by one every time that the journal is posted. For example, if HH1 is entered in the **Name** field, the journal name will change to HH2 after the journal named HH1 has been posted.

# Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers an add-in that lets you manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in for Outlook, you can see financial data related to customers and vendors, and create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in consists of two separate add-ins that provide the following capabilities:

- Contact insights

   This add-in lets you look up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also lets you create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such a sales quote or invoice to a contact.

- Document view

   When a business document is sent in an email, the add-in provides a direct link from email to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Get started

1. The first thing to do is get the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in installed in Outlook. Your administrator may have already installed the add-in for you. So if you're not sure, check with your administrator or see the next step to verify whether it's installed.

    If the add-in hasn't been installed for you, see [Install the add-in for your own use](admin-outlook.md#install). 

2. With the add-in installed, you can access the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in from any new or existing email message or calendar appointment in Outlook.

    Start by signing in to Outlook and opening an email message. Then, if you're using the Outlook app, go to the ribbon, and look for **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.  Or if you're using Outlook on the web, at the top the email message, select **Apps** ![Shows the apps button in Outlook.](media/apps-icon.png) > **Business Central** ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) or go to the more actions ![Show more actions for an email in Outlook.](media/outlook-more-actions-button.png) button.

    ![Access Business Central add-ins in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-addin.png)

   If you've installed the add-in on your own and chose to get a sample email, check your inbox for the welcome email. This email provides information to help you get started.

The first time you use the add-in, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in pane, you might be asked to sign in. In this case, choose **Sign in now** and follow the instructions onscreen to sign in to Business Central using your account.

> [!TIP]
> If you use the new Outlook on the web, you can pin **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** so that it is always immediately visible, instead of having to go to the more actions button, making it convenient to view contact insights while you browse through different emails.

For more information, see [Use add-ins in Outlook on the web](https://support.office.com/article/using-add-ins-in-outlook-on-the-web-8f2ce816-5df4-44a5-958c-f7f9d6dabdce?ns=OLWAO365B&version=16).  

## Work with contacts and documents using the Contact Insights add-in

Let's say that you get an email from a customer that wants to get a quote on some items. Directly in Outlook, you open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in, which recognizes the sender as a customer, and opens the customer card for that company. From this dashboard, you see overview information for the customer, and drill down for more detail on specific documents. You can also dig into the sales history for the customer. If it's a new contact, you can create them as a new customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] without leaving Outlook.  

In the add-in, you can create a sales quote and send it back to this customer without leaving Outlook. All of the information that you need to send the sales quote is available in your business inbox in Outlook. Once you have the data entered, you post the quote and send it by email. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates a .PDF file with the sales quote and attaches it to the email message that you draft in the add-in.  

Similarly, if you get an email from a vendor, you can use the add-in to work with vendors and purchase invoices.  

Sometimes you want to see more fields than you can see in the add-in, such as when you want to fill in lines in an invoice. To give you a bit more space to work with, you can pop out the add-in to a separate page. It's still part of Outlook, but you have more space. As you enter data for the document in the pop-out view, the changes are automatically saved. 
The following sections lead you through some basic tasks to give you a general understanding how to use it.

> [!TIP]
> The tasks explain how to use the add-in from an email message. But you can do the same from a calendar appointment in Outlook.

### Look up a business contact when composing an email

1. Create a new email message.
2. In the ribbon, go to **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** and choose **Contact Insights**. Or if you're using Outlook on the web, at the top of the message, select **Apps** ![Shows the apps button in Outlook.](media/apps-icon.png) > **Business Central** ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) > **Contact Insights**.
3. In the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in pane that opens, scan for and choose the contact you want.

    An overview of the contact displays in the pane and the contact is added in the **To** line of the email.

### View and change the contact details or switch company

The action bar at the top of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add-in pane includes several actions that let your dig deeper into details about the contact and change things.

![Business Central add-in action bar in Outlook.](media/outlook-addin-action-bar.png)

For example, you can open the full contact details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you work with more that one [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, you can easily switch between companies.

### Track incoming documents

Perhaps you use the **Incoming Documents** list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to track documents for processing that vendors send to you, such as a purchase invoice that needs to be paid. If you do, you can easily create Incoming Documents records from the Outlook add-in and include the email attachments.

1. When you receive an email from a vendor that has an attachment, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**  > **Contact Insights**.  

2. In the action bar of the add-in, choose **Show more actions**, then choose the **Send to Incoming Documents…** action.  

### Create and send new document to a contact

1. In the ribbon or at the bottom of the email message, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** > **New**, then choose the type of document you want to create, such as **Sales Quote**.
2. Make changes to the document in the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** add-in pane.
3. When the document is ready to send to the contact, in the action bar, choose **Show more actions**, then choose the **Send by Email** action.

### Attach files to records

Your email inbox often serves as a source of incoming files that initiate or unblock workflows. Files can include things like PDF invoice payments, photos of goods, or requirements in a Word document. When working in Outlook with Business Central records like vendors, customers, purchase invoices, or sales orders, you can attach these files to the records.

There's a couple ways you can attach files. One way is to upload files from your device. The other way is upload files that are attached to an email. For example, suppose you get an email with files from a contact. The add-in will automatically display the contact record that matches the email sender. From there, you can navigate to a document for the contact, like the latest sales order. Once you've identified the order that the email relates to, you quickly upload the files from the email to that order.

![Shows how to add attachments from an email to records in Business Central.](media/outlook-attach-files.png)

After attaching a file, coworkers can instantly download and view the file from the **Attachments** FactBox in any of their Business Central clients. Or, they can open the file in OneDrive to share and collaborate with their department.

#### How to attach a file

1. Open the email, choose ![Business Central add-in icon in Outlook.](media/outlook-business-central-icon.png) **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**  > **Contact Insights**.
2. In the action bar of the add-in, choose **Show more actions** > **Attachments**.

    The **Attached Documents** page opens to list any documents that are already attached to the record.
3. Choose **Attached File(s)...**, then choose one of the following options:

   - Choose **Attach from email** to upload all or selected files that are attached to the email.
   - Choose **Upload from file** to upload one or files from your device.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't attach files to all records. This feature is available for records that use the **Attachments** FactBox, such as a vendor, customer, purchase invoice, or sales order.

## View a document from an email using the Document View add-in

Whether it's an email you sent or received, you can surface any [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] document, like the sales quote, directly in Outlook. From there, you can make changes and navigate to related information&mdash;just as you would from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

If you're using the Outlook app, just choose **Document Link** at the top of the email message. For Outlook on the web, look for the document reference link in the email message. The reference link text will include the document number, which is based on the number series used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, the link for a sales quote would be something like **Sales Quote S-QUO1000**.  

> [!TIP]
> Starting in 2022 release wave 1, documents open in a new browser window with all the capabilities that you know from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can navigate from a document to a list and back again, open lists in Excel, send documents to be printed, and run or preview related reports. You also have all of the familiar keyboard shortcuts right there when you open documents from Outlook.

# Revalue inventory
If you want to appreciate or depreciate an item or a specific item ledger entry, you must use the revaluation journal.

## To revalue inventory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Revaluation Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory Value** action.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. On each line on the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, in the **Unit Cost (Revalued)** field, enter the new unit cost. Alternatively, enter the new total amount in the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.

    The relevant fields are automatically updated. The **Amount** field shows the actual change in inventory value for the selected item ledger entry. It calculates the difference between the **Inventory Value (Calculated)** field and the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.
6. When you have completed all lines in the revaluation journal, choose the **Post** action.

New value entries are now created to reflect the revaluations that you have posted. You can see the new values on the respective item cards.

# Walkthrough conducting a sales campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This increases the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers (contacts) in a follow-up campaign.  

 The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales & Marketing department. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Preparing the data.
- Setting up a campaign.  
- Selecting the target audience.  
- Mining data.  
- Sending letters to contacts.  
- Registering campaign responses.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager  
- Marketing Staffer  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. The marketing manager also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting up a campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the target audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use various criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too large. The manager decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to focus on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a segment to a campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending letters and email messages to contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

> [!NOTE]  
> If needed click on the **Edit Pencil** icon to open the page in edit mode.

1. Open the **Segment** card for the **Visitors at the FUTURUS trade show**.  
2. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template code **BUS** and select **Yes**.
3. Choose the **Language Code (Default)** field to open the **Segment Interaction Languages** page. Select a **Language Code** and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Make sure that the **Correspondence Type (Default)** is set to **Hard Copy**.
5. In the **Attachment** field, select the **Ellipsis** box. This opens the Import Attachment dialog.
    1. Select the **Choose** button to choose your file.
    1. Find the file and select the **Open** button to attach it.
6. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**. Select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to leave the field, and select the **Yes** button.
7. Slide the **Send Word Docs as Attmt** to on and select the **Yes** button.
8. Choose the action **Log**. In the Log Segment pop-up window enable:
 **Create Follow-up Segment**
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the **Log Segment batch job**.  

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.  

Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Interaction Log Entries**, and then choose the related link. There's an entry for each sent letter.  

### To send an email message to a contact  

1. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template, code **BUS**.  
2. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**.  
3. In the **Correspondence Type** field, choose **E-Mail**.  
4. Specify language settings, and attach a Word document, as in the previous procedure.  
5. Choose the **Log** action. The **Log Segment** page opens.  
6. Select the **Send Attachments** check box to have the attachments sent by email.  
7. Select the **Create Follow-up Segment** check box.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

 The letters are automatically sent by email, and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is saved in the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Register campaign responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and records these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.  

 There's no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns. Therefore, create a new template.  

2. On the **Interaction Templates** dropdown, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter **RESP**, and in the **Description** field, enter **Campaign Responses**.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to apply this interaction template code to all segment lines.
6. On the **Campaign** FastTab, select the **Campaign Response** field. Choose **Yes** to confirm the message *You have modified Campaign Response*.  
7. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Log** action.  
8. On the **Log Segment** page, clear the **Send Attachments** check box. Then choose the **OK** button to confirm the message that the segment has been logged.

# Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** page, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPrem Notes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

# How to use banking and payment formats in Business Central

Banking and payment formats can change over time and vary by country/region and bank. To help you connect to your bank and handle transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft works with partners who provide apps that support different formats and integrations. 

In some countries/regions, Microsoft also provides built-in imports and export options. However, these options aren't adapted to newer versions of the formats, unless the bank requires it. Also, there will be no development of new banking and payment-related formats. This affects the country/region localizations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that Microsoft releases. For a list of local versions, see [list of localizations here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). 

## Frequently Asked Questions about supported banking and payment formats

### Will [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] discontinue these import/export options and the current formats?  

No, there are no plans to remove the current formats and import/export options. You can still use them, and partners, and customers can still build integrations for them.  

### How can I find banking and payment apps for my country/region?

You can find ISV banking solutions that support banking and/or payment-related functionality on the **Banking Apps** page or on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)

Make sure to check the features of each app to see if they match your business needs and your bank requirements. 

> [!NOTE]
> There's one exception. The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds and AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals apps aren't impacted and still supported. 

### Is there no plan to support banking connectivity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the future?  

Yes, Microsoft wants to enable you to connect to your bank and perform fundamental tasks in a modern and secure manner. This is why Microsoft supports partners who create apps for this purpose.

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

>[!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Row group</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Columns that only have a few possible values are the best candidates for using in column **Values**.

## Want to Export data to Excel?

Right-click on the data area or a selection of cells to export data.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-export-to-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to export data from an analysis to Excel":::


## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).

# Managing inventory costs
Cost management, also referred to as 'costing,' is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.   


The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|
|Specify a default costing method for the company to govern how incoming cost is used to assess inventory value and the cost of goods sold.|[Set Up General Inventory Information](inventory-how-setup-general.md)|  
|Specify a costing method on individual items if they require a different costing method.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|  
|Define inventory periods to control inventory value over time by disallowing transaction posting in closed inventory periods.|[Work with Inventory Periods](finance-how-to-work-with-inventory-periods.md)|  
|Ensure that sales returns are applied to the original outbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page|  
|Ensure that purchase returns are applied to the original inbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Purchases & Payables** page|
|Set up the rounding rules to apply when adjusting or suggesting item prices and when adjusting or suggesting standard costs.|**Rounding Method** page|  

Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Ensure that you know the cost of shipped items by assigning added item costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur after selling.|[Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md)|
|Appreciate or depreciate the value of one or more items in inventory by posting their current, calculated value.|[Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md)|
|View and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.|[Remove and Reapply Item Ledger Entries](finance-how-to-remove-and-reapply-item-entries.md)|
|Adjust item costs, either automatically or manually, to forward cost changes from inbound entries to their related outbound entries.|[Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md)|
|Perform period-end control and reporting tasks, such as calculate the value of inventory and post costs to the general ledger.|[Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md)|
|Learn how you can use the job queue to move the tasks for adjusting inventory cost or reconciling it with the general ledger to the background.|[Adjust and Reconcile Inventory Cost with General Ledger with Job Queue](finance-adjust-reconcile-inventory-cost-job-queue.md)|
|Use the **Applies-from Entry** field in the item journal to manually create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction.|[Close Open Item Ledger Entries Resulting from Fixed Application in the Item Journal](finance-how-to-close-open-item-ledger-entries-resulting-from-fixed-application-in-the-item-journal.md)|  

Use special costing functions for every-day item transactions in the item operations.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Read why standard costs are often used by manufacturing companies as a valuation base for components and end items and how to periodically update the standard costs of components, in assembly or production BOMs, and roll the new costs up to the parent item.|[About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)|
|Calculate the unit cost of a BOM item based on the unit costs of its underlying components.|[Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) |  
|Complete the costing life cycle of a produced item by adjusting the costs and reconciling the value entries with the general ledger.|[About Finished Production Order Costs](finance-about-finished-production-order-costs.md)|  

Read various conceptual information to understand the principles and definitions that govern the inventory costing accounting functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Understand all mechanisms in the costing engine, including what happens when you post assembly and production transactions.|[Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md)|

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

This extension uses the Computer Vision API from Azure Cognitive Services, which may have varying levels of compliance commitments than [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you enable the Image Analyzer extension, Customer Data such as a contact image or an item image will be sent to the Computer Vision API. By installing this extension, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the Computer Vision API. Note that you may disable, and uninstall, the Image Analyzer extension at any time to discontinue use of this functionality. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851463).

## Requirements

There are a few requirements for the images:

* Image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP  
* Maximum file size: Less than 4 MB  
* Image dimensions: Greater than 50 x 50 pixels  

## Switch on the Image Analyzer extension

The Image Analyzer extension is built in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You just need to switch it on.

> [!NOTE]  
> To enable the Image Analyzer extension, you must be an administrator. Make sure that you are assigned the **SUPER** user permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

To enable the Image Analyzer extension, take one of the following actions:

* Open an item or contact card. In the notification bar, choose **Analyze Picture**, then follow the steps in the assisted setup guide.  
* Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose **Image Analysis Setup**. Choose the **Enable Image Analyzer** check box, and then complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > The **Image Analysis Setup** page is also where you can change the degree of confidence for attribute suggestions. For example, if you want to require a greater degree of confidence, you can enter a higher percentage.

## Analyze an item image

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the item, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. The **Image Analyzer Attributes** page displays the detected attributes, the confidence level, and other details about the attribute. Use the **Action to perform** options to specify what to do with the attribute or choose **Add to item description** to add the name of the attribute to the item description. For example, this action can be useful for quickly adding detail.

The **Action to perform** field has following options:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| *Ignore* | No actions will be performed. |
| *Use as attribute* | The value is added to the item attributes. Learn more at [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md). |
| *Use as a category* | The selected value is added as a category. Learn more at [Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md). |
| *Add to blocklist* | If the analysis suggests an attribute that you do not want to see, you can block the attribute. Use caution, however. Blocked attributes are not suggested for other items either. If you regret blocking an attribute, choose **View Blocked Attributes**, and then delete the attribute from the list. |

> [!NOTE]  
> By default **Item Attributes** displays attributes where **Confidence Score** is above **Confidence Score Threshold %** defined in the **Image Analysis Setup**. To see all detected attributes, choose the **View All Attributes** action.

## Analyze a contact person picture

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contact person, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. On the **Profile Questionnaire** FastTab, review the suggestions, and make corrections if needed. Learn more at [Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts](marketing-create-contact-profile-questionnaire.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >
    > The Computer Vision API returns following attributes:
    >
    > * *age*
    >
    >     An estimated "visual age" in years. It is how old a person looks as opposed to the actual biological age.
    > * *gender*
    >
    >    Male or female.
    >
    > The Computer Vision API doesn't return a confidence level for age and gender attributes.
  
## Use your own Computer Vision API account

You can also use your own account for the Computer Vision API, for example, if you want to analyze more images than the default integration offers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the **API URI** and **API Key** that you received for Computer Vision API.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must add **/analyze** at the end of the API URI, if it isn't already there. For example: ```https://cronus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze```.

## See how many analyses you have left in the current period

You can view the number of analyses you've done, and how many you can still do, in the current period.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Limit Type**, **Limit Value**, and **Analyses Performed** fields provide the usage information.  

## Stop using the Image Analyzer extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose **Image Analysis Setup**.  
2. Clear the **Enable Image Analyzer** field.  

Alternatively, uninstall the extension completely. You can always fetch it again from AppSource. For more information, see [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md#uninstall-an-app).

# Create Blanket Assembly Orders

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

 As with any other type of item, you can also create blanket sales orders for customized assembly items before periodically making the actual sales orders according to the blanket order agreement. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular blanket sales order, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is a blanket assembly order.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all blanket orders, quantities on assembly blanket orders are only forecasts and are not operational until they are converted to actual assembly orders. Therefore, order functionality, such as availability calculation, reservation, and item tracking, is not active on blanket assembly orders.  

## To create a blanket assembly order for an assemble\-to\-order item  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new blanket sales order with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).  
3. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the blanket assembly order line, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not create blanket order agreements for a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the blanket sales order line.  

4. Choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order)** field on the line.  
5. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement that you have made with the customer. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket assembly order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6. When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Blanket Sales Order** page.  
7. When the customer requests to create a sales order based on the agreed blanket sales order, create a sales order for the agreed assembly item or items. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

The linked blanket assembly order and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Ship items with a warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about shipping items, go to [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to methods C and D in the table. In both methods, you start by creating a shipment document from a business source document. Then you pick the specified items for the shipment.

When a location requires warehouse shipments, you can ship items based on source documents that were released to the warehouse. Releasing source documents makes the items on them ready to be handled in the warehouse. The following are examples of source documents:

* Sales orders
* Purchase return orders
* Transfer orders
* Service orders

You can create a warehouse shipment in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Shipment** action in the source document to create a warehouse shipment for the document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document to release it to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a **Warehouse Shipment** for one or many released source documents. The following procedure describes how to create warehouse shipment in a pull fashion.

## To ship items using a warehouse shipment document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipments**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**.  
3. In the **No.** field, choose the number series to use to create an ID for the shipment.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, choose the location you're shipping from. 

    When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information from the location is copied to each line.  
5. If the location requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  
6. You can get the source document in two ways:

    * Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Outbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires shipment.
    * Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page opens. You can select the source document filter and apply it. All released source document lines that fulfill the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your location uses cross-docking and bins for each line, you can review the quantity of items placed in the cross-dock bins. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantities whenever the fields on the shipment are updated. If they're the items on the shipment you're preparing, you can create a pick for all the items and then complete the shipment. Learn more at [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

7. Create a warehouse pick. If the location requires picking, you can create pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

    * In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to pick and specify information about the picks. For example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
    * In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get your assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted. Learn more at [Pick Items for Warehouse Shipment](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > For a location that doesn't require picking, you can print warehouse shipment and use it as a picking list.

8. Specify the quantity to ship.  

    For a location that requires picking, the **Qty. to Ship** field is updated automatically when the pick is registered. Otherwise, the **Qty. to Ship** field is filled with the quantity outstanding for each line when warehouse shipment line is created.

    You can change the quantity, but you can't ship more items than the number in the **Qty. Outstanding** field on the source document line or the **Qty. Picked** field if picking is required.

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Ship** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the shipping quantities. To add the quantity available for shipping, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Ship** action.

9. Post the shipment.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse shipment, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that define which items to ship.

1. In the warehouse shipment, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. 
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Outbound** page opens.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example you can select types of source documents, such as sales or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page on which you set the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page and are available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

If bins are mandatory at the location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests a zone and bin code on the warehouse shipment document.

* For advanced configurations in which a location uses directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card**. If a **Shipment Bin Code** isn't specified, the field is blank. If the item and shipment bin don't match, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] leaves the shipment bin blank.
* In other cases, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card** first. If a shipment bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

## Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments

In assemble-to-order scenarios, use the **Qty. to Ship** field on warehouse shipment lines to record how many units are assembled. The quantity is posted as assembly output when you post the warehouse shipment. For other warehouse shipment lines, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is zero.

When workers finish assembling some or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, record the quantity on the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line. Then choose the **Post Shipment** action. The assembly output is posted, including the component consumption. A sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the sales order.

From the assembly order, you can choose **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** to access the warehouse shipment line.

After you post the warehouse shipment, various fields on the sales order line are updated to show progress in the warehouse. The following fields are also updated to show how many assemble-to-order quantities remain to be assembled and shipped:

* **ATO Whse. Outstanding Qty.**
* **ATO Whse. Outstd. Qty. (Base)**

> [!NOTE]
> In combination scenarios where a part of the quantity must be assembled and another must be shipped from inventory, two warehouse shipment lines are created. One is for the assemble-to-order quantity, and one is for the inventory quantity.
>
> The assemble-to-order quantity is handled as described in this article. The inventory quantity is handled as a regular warehouse shipment line. To learn more about combination scenarios, go to [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

# Set up data exchange definitions

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to exchange data in specific tables with data on external files. For example to send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll, and item catalogs. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

To create a data exchange definition for a data file or stream, you can use the related XML schema to define which data elements to include on the **Column Definitions** FastTab. See step 6 in [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#to-describe-the-formatting-of-lines-and-columns-in-the-file). Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Normally, you set up data exchange definitions on the **Data Exchange Definition** page. However, for updating currency exchange rates, it's faster to use a currency exchange rate service. Learn more at [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the file that is being converted is in the XML format, the term *"column"* in this article should be interpreted as an *"XML element containing data"*.  

This article includes the following procedures:  

* Create a data exchange definition.
* Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others.
* Import an XML file for an existing data exchange definition.

## Create a data exchange definition

Creating a data exchange definition involves two tasks:  

1. On the **Data Exchange Definition** page, describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file. Learn more in the [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](#formatlinescolumns) section.  
2. On the **Data Exchange Mapping** page, map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](#mapfields) section.  

### <a name=formatlinescolumns></a>To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, describe the data exchange definition and the data file type by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Definition|

    |**Footer Tag**|If a footer line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the footer line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the footer data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  

   > [!TIP]
   > To see which codeunits Microsoft uses in existing definitions in the standard product, review the three **Codeunit** fields on the **Field Mapping** page, under the **General** FastTab, for each definition.  

4. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, describe the formatting of lines in the data file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For import of bank statements, you only create one line for the single format of the bank statement file that you want to import.  
    >
    > For export of payments, you can create a line for each payment type that you want to export. In that case, the **Column Definitions** FastTab shows different columns for each payment type.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Line Type**|Specifies the type of the line in the file.|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the line in the file.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name that describes the line in the file.|  
    |**Column Count**|Specify how many columns the line in the data file has. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Data Line Tag**|Specify the position in the related XML schema of the element that represents the main entry of the data file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Namespace**|Specify the namespace that's expected in the file to enable namespace validation. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to enable namespace validation.|  
    |**Parent Code**|Specify the line's parent, as displayed in the **Code** field in cases where the data exchange setup is for files with parent and children entries, such as a document header and lines.

5. Repeat step 4 to create a line for every type of file data that you want to export.  

     Proceed to describe the formatting of columns in the data file by filling the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab as described in the table in step 8. You can use a structure file, such as an .xsd file, for the data file to prefill the FastTab with the relevant elements. Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).

6. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, choose the **Get File Structure** action.  
7. On the **Get File Structure** page, select the related structure file, then choose **OK**. The lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab are filled according to the structure of the data file.  
8. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, edit or fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Column No.**|Specify the number that reflects the column's position on the line in the file.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the number that reflects the type of element in the file that contains the data.|  
    |**Name**|Specify the name of the column.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the markup that marks the data to be exchanged.|  
    |**Data Type**|Specify if the data to be exchanged is of type **Text**, **Date**, or **Decimal**.|  
    |**Data Format**|Specify the format of the data, if any. For example, **MM-dd-yyyy** if the data type is **Date**. **Note:** For export, specify the data format according to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For import, specify the data format according to the .NET Framework. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).|  
    |**Data Formatting Culture**|Specify the regional data format, if any. For example, **en-US** if the data type is **Decimal** to make sure that comma is used as the 0.000 separator, according to the US format. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings). **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Length**|Specify the length of the fixed-width line that holds the column if the data file is of type **Fixed Text**.|  
    |**Description**|Specifies a description of the column, for informational purposes.|  
    |**Path**|Specify the position of the element in the related XML schema.|  
    |**Negative-Sign Identifier**|Enter the value that is used in the data file to identify negative amounts, in data files that can't contain negative signs. This identifier is then used to reverse the identified amounts to negative signs during import. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Constant**|Specify any data that you want to export in this column, such as extra information about the payment type. **Note:** This field is only relevant for export.|  
    |**Text Padding Required**|Specify that the data must include text padding.|  
    |**Pad Character**|Specify the text padding character.|  
    |**Justification**|Specify if the column justification is left or right.|  

9. Repeat step 8 for every column or XML element in the data file that has data that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The next step in creating a data exchange definition is to decide which columns or XML elements in the data file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> The specific mapping depends on the business purpose of the data file to be exchanged and on local variations. Even the SEPA bank standard has local variations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import of SEPA CAMT bank statement files out\-of\-the\-box. This is represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition record code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page. For information about the specific field mapping of this SEPA CAMT support, see [Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files](across-field-mapping-when-importing-sepa-camt-files.md).  

### <a name=mapfields></a>To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in one business app the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in another it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you exchange data. This happens through transformation rules that you define for the fields. Learn more at [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

You can also group by any field, use the key index to sort results, and the new transformation types **Rounding** and **Field Lookup**.

1. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select the line for which you want to map columns to fields, then choose **Field Mapping**. The **Data Exchange Mapping** page opens.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, specify the mapping setup by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table ID**|Specify the table that holds the fields to or from which data is exchanged according to the mapping.|  
    |**Use as Intermediate Table**|Specify if the table that you select in the **Table ID** field is an intermediate table where the imported data is stored before it's mapped to the target table.<br/><br/> You typically use an intermediate table when the data exchange definition imports and converts electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, documents such as vendor invoices into purchase invoices. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the mapping setup.|  
    |**Key Index**|Specify the key index to sort the source records before exporting.|
    |**Pre-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that prepares the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data.|  
    |**Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to map the specified columns or XML data elements to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Post-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that completes the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data. **Note:**  When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension feature, the codeunit converts exported data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a generic format that's ready for export. For import, the codeunit converts external data to a format that is ready for import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
3. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, specify which columns map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by filling the fields as described in the following tables, depending on whether the **Use as Intermediate Table** field was enabled or not.  
   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle off:

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field ID**|Specify which field the column in the **Column No.** field maps to.<br /><br /> You can only select from fields that exist in the table that you specified in the **Table ID** field on the **General** FastTab.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Optional**|Specify if the map should be skipped if the field is empty. If you don't select this option, then an export error occurs if the field is empty.|  
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about how to apply transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Overwrite Value**|Specify that the new value can overwrite the current value.|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|
     |**Multiplier**|Specify a multiplier to be applied on numeric data, including negative values.|

   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle enabled:

     |Field|Description|  
     |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Table ID**|Specify the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Table Caption**|Specify the name of the table in the **Target Table ID** field, which is the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Field ID**|Specify the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the name of the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Validate Only**|Specify that the element-to-field map isn't used to convert data, but only to validate data.|
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|

4. On the **Field Grouping** FastTab, specify rules you want to use to group your fields when you create the file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Field ID**|Specify the number of the field in the external file that is used for grouping, and that the user must set this field.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is used for grouping.|

## Transformation Rules

If the values in the fields you're mapping differ, you must use transformation rules for data exchange definitions to make them the same. You define transformation rules for data exchange definitions by opening an existing definition, or creating a new definition, and then on the **Line Definitions** FastTab, choosing **Manage**, and then **Field Mapping**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. The following table describes the types of transformations that you can perform.

|Option|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Uppercase**|Capitalize all letters.|
|**Lowercase**|Make all letters lowercase.|
|**Title Case**|Capitalize the first letter of each word.|
|**Trim**|Remove empty spaces before and after the value.|
|**Substring**|Transform a specific portion of a value. To specify where to start the transformation, choose either a **Start Position** or **Starting Text**. The starting position is a number that represents the first character to transform. The starting text is the letter immediately before the letter to replace. If you want to start with the first letter in the value, use a starting position instead. To specify where to stop the transformation, you choose either **Length**, which is the number of characters to replace, or the **Ending Text**, which is the character that is immediately after the last character to transform.|
|**Replace**|Find a value and replace it with another. This transformation is useful for replacing simple values, such as a particular word.|
|**Regular Expression - Replace**|Use a regular expression as part of a find and replace operation. This transformation is useful for replacing multiple, or more complex, values.|
|**Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters**|Delete characters that aren't letters or numbers, such as symbols or special characters.|
|**Date Formatting**|Specify how to display dates. For example, you can transform DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.|
|**Decimal Formatting**|Define rules for decimal placement and rounding precision.|
|**Regular Expression - Match**|Use a regular expression to find one or more values. This rule is similar to the **Substring** and **Regular Expression - Replace** options.|
|**Custom**|This transformation rule is an advanced option that requires assistance from a developer. It enables an integration event that you can subscribe to if you want to use your own transformation code. If you're a developer and want to use this option, go to [Tip for developers: Example of the custom option](#tip-for-developers-example-of-the-custom-option).|
|**Date and Time Formatting**|Define how to display the current date and the time of day.|
|**Field Lookup**|Use fields from different tables. To use it, you need to follow some rules. First, use **Table ID** to specify the ID of the table that contains the record for the field lookup. Then, in the **Source Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field that contains the record for the field lookup. Finally, in the **Target Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field to find the record for the field lookup. Optionally, use the **Field Lookup Rule** field to specify the type of the field lookup. For the **Target** field, the value from the **Target Field ID** is used, even if it's blank. For the **Original If Target Is Blank** field, the original value is used if the target is blank.|
|**Round**|Round the value in this field using some extra rules. First, in the **Precision** field, specify a rounding precision. Then, in the **Direction** field, specify the rounding direction.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Learn more about date and time formatting at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).

### Tip for developers: Example of the custom option

The following example shows how to implement your own transformation code.

```AL
codeunit 60100 "Hello World"
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::"Transformation Rule", 'OnTransformation', '', false, false)]
    procedure OnTransformation(TransformationCode: Code[20]; InputText: Text; var OutputText: Text)
    begin
        if TransformationCode = 'CUST' then
            OutputText := InputText + ' testing';
    end;
}
```

After you define your rules, you can test them. In the **Test** FastTab, enter an example of a value that you want to transform, then check the results by choosing **Update**.

## Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others

After you create the data exchange definition for a specific data file, you can export the data exchange definition as an XML file that you can import. This task is described in the following procedure.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the data exchange definition that you want to export.  
3. Choose the **Export Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  

    If a data exchange definition was already created, you just have to import the XML file into the Data Exchange Framework. This task is described in the following procedure.  

## Import an existing data exchange definition

1. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
3. Choose the **Import Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Choose the file that you saved in step 1.

# Design details: costing methods

The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Together with the posting date and sequence, the costing method also influences how the cost flow is recorded.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change an item's costing method if item ledger entries exist for the item. For more information, see [Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

The following methods are supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

| Costing method | Description | When to use |
|--|--|--|
| FIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. | In business environments where product cost is stable.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.)<br /><br /> For items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date. |
| LIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. | Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates.) |
| Average | An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that all inventories are sold simultaneously. | In business environments where product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> When inventories are piled or mixed together and can't be differentiated, such as chemicals. |
| Specific | An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. | In production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> For items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> For items with serial numbers. |
| Standard | An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values. | Where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> In repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Where there's discipline and staff to maintain standards. |

The following image shows how costs flow through the inventory for each costing method.  

![Costing methods visualized.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_7_costing_methods.png "Costing methods visualized")  

Costing methods differ in the way that they value inventory decreases and if they use actual cost or standard cost as the valuation base. The following table explains the different characteristics. (The LIFO method is excluded, as it's similar to the FIFO method.)

## Example

This section gives examples of how different costing methods affect inventory value.  

The following table shows the inventory increases and decreases that the examples are based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|1|1|  
|01-01-20|1|2|  
|01-01-20|1|3|  
|02-01-20|-1|4|  
|03-01-20|-1|5|  
|04-01-20|-1|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting quantity in inventory is zero. Consequently, the inventory value must also be zero, regardless of the costing method.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Increases  

For items with costing methods that use actual cost as the valuation base (**FIFO**, **LIFO**, **Average**, or **Specific**), inventory increases are valued at the item's acquisition cost.  

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

#### Standard  

For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Decreases

- **FIFO**  

    For items using the **FIFO** costing method, items that were purchased first are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the first inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the first inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **FIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|6|  

- **LIFO**  

    For items using the **LIFO** costing method, items that were purchased most recently are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the last inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the most recent inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **LIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------|--------|--------------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-30.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|  

- **Average**  

    For items using the **Average** costing method, inventory decreases are valued by calculating a weighted average of the remaining inventory on the last day of the average cost period in which the inventory decrease was posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md).  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Average** costing method.  

    | Posting Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
    |--|--|--|--|

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory decreases are valued similar to the **FIFO** costing method, except valuation is based on a standard cost, not on the actual cost.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Standard** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-15.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-15.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-15.00|6|  

- **Specific**  

    Costing methods make an assumption about how cost flows from an inventory increase to an inventory decrease. However, if more accurate information about the cost flow exists, then you can override this assumption by creating a fixed application between entries. A fixed application creates a link between an inventory decrease and a specific inventory increase and directs the cost flow accordingly.  

    For items that use the **Specific** costing method, inventory decreases are valued according to the inventory increase that the fixed application links it to.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Specific** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Applies-to Entry|Entry No.|
    |------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-20.00|**2**|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-10.00|**1**|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|**3**|6|

# Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files.

## To find posted documents without incoming document records

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a G/L account for whose general ledger entries you want to see posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records, and then choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** action.
3. Alternatively, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. On the **General Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Documents** action.

The **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page opens showing posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records represented by general ledger entries on the G/L account that you opened the page for. The page can show a maximum of 1000 lines. By default, the **Date Filter** field therefore contains a filter that limits the lines to entries with posting dates from the beginning of the accounting period to the work date.

## To connect found documents to existing incoming document records

1. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, select the line for a posted document that you want to connect to an existing incoming document record, and then choose the **Select Incoming Document** action.
2. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the incoming document record that you want to connect to posted document found, and then choose the **OK** button.
3. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, the selected incoming document record is now connected to the posted document, as you can see in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

If a relevant incoming document record doesn't exist on the **Incoming Documents** page, then you can create it. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

# Sustainability value chain in sales

When you sell items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the **CO2e per Unit** field from the **Item** card for each sales line that contains emission values. It uses the average calculation method to calculate the value.  

When you post all sales documents, the posted documents keep the **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values for each line.

The result of posting shows as a new sustainability value entry for each line that has **Sale** as its **Item Ledger Entry Type**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values aren't used in default report layouts. However, if you want to show these details when you print reports, you can create a new document report to show this data.

# Average Production Times (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Average Production Times** report shows the detailed average production times for each item. The report can help you make informed decisions and optimize your production processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Average Production Times Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the average time it takes to produce each item. For example, you might want to identify the items that take the longest to produce and schedule their production process.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the production time for a particular item and the quantity produced on production orders. For example, you notice that the production time for a particular item is longer than expected. You can use the report to identify the cause of the delay and optimize the production process to increase efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Average Production Times* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Setup Time per Unit (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#setup-time-per-unit-hours)
- [Run Time per Unit (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#run-time-per-unit-hours)
- [Stop Time per Unit (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#stop-time-per-unit-hours)

# Batch post production consumption

If the flushing method is **Manual**, use a consumption journal to post the components manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field on the location card to indicate that the location requires inventory pick processing, you don't need to use this batch job. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles consumption when you post the inventory pick. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  

You can also set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    Use the **Calc. Consumption** action to generate journal lines from production orders based on the actual output (the quantity of finished goods that you reported) or on the expected output (the quantity of finished goods that you expect to produce).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured the location to require warehouse pick processing, only quantities that are already picked through a warehouse activity can be entered in the **Quantity** field in the **Consumption Journal** page. It can't be a calculated quantity. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production or Assembly in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).

3. Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related inventories are reduced.

# Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze inventory data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "expiring stock" or "top sellers," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of inventory processes:

- [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis)

## Inventory ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of inventory scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Inventory on-hand](#example-inventory-on-hand) | Get an overview of items that are available in your inventory. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Item No.**, **Remaining Quantity** |
|[Example: track expiring or old stock](#example-track-expiring-or-old-stock) | Get an overview of items in your inventory that have been on stock for a long time and aren't selling well. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Posting Date Year**, **Posting Date Month**, **Item No.**, **Posting Date**, **Entry type**, **Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity**. |
| [Returned items by return reason](#example-returned-items-by-return-reason) | Get an overview of goods that customers return, categorized by the return reason. Use this for analysis for quality control. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Return Reason Code**, **Posting Date Month**, **Quantity** , **Cost Amount**, **Posting Date**, **Document Type**, **Item No.**, and  **Document No.** . |
| Inventory throughput | Get an overview of purchases and sales in your inventory by month or quarter. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Posting Date Year**, **Posting Date Month**, **Item No.**, **Quantity**, **Sales Amount**, **Cost Amount (Actual)**, and **Posting Date Month** |
| [Inventory movements] | Get an overview of how goods in your inventory move between locations. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Location Code**, **Quantity**, **Posting Date**, **Item No.** |

## Example: inventory on-hand

To analyze items in your inventory that are in stock, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you add the Posting Date field, you can also track movements over time.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on inventory

When you post a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries.

- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables. To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the purchase line is of the Item type). In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables. To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

# Project analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for project managers, such as:

- Cost performance for projects
- Completion rates for projects
- Financial data for projects

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's project data:

- Power BI reports for projects
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in project analytics tools
- Built-in project reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your projects.

## Analytics needs in projects

When you think about the analytics needs in projects management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in project management interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
|Project Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
|Project participant | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor project KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In project management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor project performance:

- % Complete
- % Invoiced
- Realization %
- Actual Profit
- Actual Profit Margin %
- Actual (Total Cost)
- Budget (Total Cost)

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Projects Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-overview.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for projects in the Project Power BI app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-projects-app](includes/power-bi-projects-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of project data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Project Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for projects

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help project organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-projects](includes/report-explorer-projects.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for project management, go to [Built-in project reports](project-reports.md).

## On-screen project analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you project overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [Monitor project progress and performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)

# Set Up Shipment Methods

Shipment methods often depend on the items, the customers, and the vendors. For example, if the customer lives on an island, they can choose to have items always shipped by air or always by sea. Some customers may require next day delivery. Some may want to pick up the order. On the customer and vendor cards, you can specify what sort of delivery is desired.

You set up the description and code for each shipment method on the **Shipment Methods** page. For example, you can set up the code FOB, and enter Free on Board in the **Description** field. You can then enter the code in **Shipment Method Code** fields elsewhere in the system, such as on a customer card. Then when you create new orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on, the system will enter the description represented by the code. You can change it on the document as needed.

## To set up a shipment method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Shipment Methods** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, specify a code and description for the shipment method.

> [!TIP]
> If you use Incoterms, set up shipment methods to represent the relevant Incoterms rules.

# Manage fixed assets

The fixed assets functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an overview of your fixed assets and helps ensure that their depreciation is correct. It also helps you track maintenance costs, manage insurance policies, post fixed asset transactions, and generate various reports and statistics.

## What is a fixed asset?

Fixed assets differ from other items in your warehouse. A fixed asset, also known as a capital asset, is a tangible piece of property, plant, or equipment (PP&E) that you own or manage with the expectation that it will continue to help generate income. An asset is fixed when it’s an item that your business won’t consume, sell, or convert to cash within the next calendar year. Fixed assets are different than current assets, which are in cash or slated to be converted to cash within the next 12 months. Fixed assets also differ from your inventory, because inventory is typically consumed within a short time.

## Types of fixed assets

Businesses typically invest in a few types of fixed assets. Some examples are:

- Buildings and facilities
- Computer equipment and software
- Furniture and fixtures
- Machinery
- Vehicles

## Understanding fixed asset accounting

Fixed asset accounting means keeping precise financial records about your capital assets. These records include details about the five stages in an asset's lifecycle. After your initial purchase, each fixed asset’s lifecycle includes at least three of the following stages:

- Acquisition: You add a new fixed asset to your books.
- Depreciation: You record an asset's periodic decline in value, which you use a depreciation method to calculate. To learn more, go to [FA Depreciation Calculation](LocalFunctionality/India/FA_Depreciation.md).
- Revaluation: You record an assessment of the current fair market value of an asset. To learn more, go to [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).
- Impairment: You record a reduction in value due to events or circumstances.
- Disposal: You sell, scrap, or use another way dispose of an asset at the end of its service life.

Audits are also included in the detailed checks of your company’s accounting records after closing the books for the financial year. Whether internal or external, audits are where you might notice inconsistencies or differences between your notes and the actual state of your assets. Audits promote transparency in your assets and accounting if you’re losing more money than anticipated.

## Video overview

The following video covers the basics of fixed assets:

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=32fa27be-9e9a-4637-bc9b-87eb994f5ae0]

## Initial setup of fixed assets

Before you can manage fixed assets, you must complete the following setups:

- Default values
- Fixed asset accounting
- Posting groups and types
- Allocation keys
- Fixed asset journals

To learn more, go to [Setting Up Fixed Assets](fa-setup.md).

## Register fixed assets

For each fixed asset, you must set up a card that contains information about them. For example, you can set up buildings or production equipment as main assets with a component list. You can group assets in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. Then you can acquire, maintain, and sell the fixed assets. You can also set up budgeted assets. Budgeting lets you include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.

## Set up depreciations for your fixed assets

To track fixed asset depreciations and other financial transactions for fixed assets, set up one or more depreciation books for each one. There are a few steps to depreciate assets:

1. Run a report that calculates periodic depreciation.
1. Fill in a journal with the resulting entries.
1. Post the journal.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports several depreciation methods. To learn more, go to [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md). You can set up multiple depreciation books for each fixed asset for different purposes, such as one for tax reporting and another for internal reporting.

## Fixed assets maintenance and insurance

You can record maintenance costs and the next service date for each asset. Tracking maintenance expenses can be important for budgeting purposes and deciding whether to replace a fixed asset. You can attach each fixed asset to one or more insurance policies, and verify that policy premiums align with the value of the assets.

## Tips for improving your fixed asset accounting

There are a few things you can implement in your accounting strategy for fixed assets that can help ensure you’re maximizing your earnings.

- Establish a threshold for capitalization. When you purchase an item, determine a fixed amount for capitalization. The amount helps ensure your accounting books are consistent, and makes it easier for you and your team to spot accounting errors.
- Reevaluate equipment lifecycle. It's important to correctly estimate the length of time you can use your fixed assets for their original purpose. Because accounting and depreciation rely on accurate lifecycle estimates, reevaluate when necessary because it might change over time.
- Tag your assets. It’s essential to track and tag your assets throughout their lifecycle because many factors can affect their value. Tagging helps track your items throughout the stages of their lifecycle, and help prevent theft, eliminate misplacement, and support financial statistics.
- Automate insight with fixed asset accounting software. Automating manual activities to track your data with fixed asset accounting software make processes easier to complete. Password protection can help provide access only to the people who need it and are trained for it.

# (Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

By default, reports have a built-in layout. The report layout can be either an RDLC (report definition language client side) report layout, a Microsoft Word report layout, or both. And while you can't modify built-in layouts, you can create custom layouts. A report can have multiple custom report layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations you send to customers as PDF files.

To create a custom layout, either copy an existing custom layout or add a new custom layout. Custom layouts are often based on a built-in layout. When you add a new custom layout, you can choose to add either an RDLC or a Word report layout type, or both. The new custom layout is based on the built-in layout for the report, if one is available. If there's no built-in layout for the report type, a new blank layout is created. You modify and design this blank layout from scratch. Learn more about RDLC, Word, built-in, and custom layouts in [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Learn more at [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

After you define your custom report layouts, you can select them on the customer card and vendor card pages. The layouts are then used when you create documents for the customer or vendor. Learn more at [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

You can also use custom report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Create a custom layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports available in the company specified in the **Company Name** field at the top of the page.
1. In the **Company Name** field, choose the company you want to create the report layout for.
1. Select the row for the report you want to create the layout for, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

   The **Custom Report Layouts** page appears and lists all the custom layouts available for the selected report.
1. If you want to create a copy of an existing custom layout, select the existing custom layout in the list, then choose the **Copy** action.  

   The copy of the custom layout appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page and has the words *Copy of* in the **Description** field.
1. If you want to add a new custom layout based on a built-in layout, follow these steps:  
   1. Choose the **New** action. The **Insert Built-in Layout for a Report** page appears with the **ID** and **Name** fields automatically filled in.
   1. Turn on the **Insert Word Layout** toggle to add a custom Word report layout type OR turn on the **Insert RDLC Layout** toggle to add a custom RDLC report layout type.
   1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The new custom layout now appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If a new layout is based on a built-in layout, then the words **Copy of a Built-in Layout** appear in the **Description** field. If there was no built-in layout for the report, then the new layout has the words **New Layout** in the **Description** field, which means that custom layout is blank.
1. By default, the **Company Name** field is blank and the custom layout is available for reports by all companies. To make the custom layout available to a specific company only, choose **Edit**, then set the **Company Name** field to the company you want.

The custom layout is created and you can modify it as you like.

> [!TIP]
> You can export the report results to a Microsoft Excel file to view the full dataset, including all columns, but without the layout. The Excel file can help you validate the report returns the expected data or diagnose problems. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel](report-analyze-excel.md).

## <a name="ModifyCustomLayout"></a>Modifying a custom layout

To modify a custom report layout, you must first export the report layout as a file to a location on your computer or network. Then, open the exported document and make the changes. When you're finished making the changes, you import the report layout.

### Modify a custom layout

1. Export a custom layout from the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If that page isn't already open, search for and open the **Report Layout Selection** page, select the report that has the layout you want to modify, then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  
1. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the layout you want to modify, choose the **Export Layout** action, then choose **Save** or **Save As** to save the report layout document to a location on your computer or network.  
1. Open the report layout document you saved and make changes.

   If you're changing a Word layout, open the layout document in Word. Learn more about editing Word reports at [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)<!--the next section [Making Changes to the Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#MakeChangesToLayout)-->.

   RDLC report layouts are more advanced than Word report layouts. Learn more about modifying an RDLC report layout at [Designing RDLC Report Layouts](/dynamics-nav/Designing-RDLC-Report-Layouts).

   Remember to save your changes when you're done.

1. Return to the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the report layout you exported and modified, then choose the **Import Layout** action.  
1. In the **Import** dialog box, select **Choose** to find and select the modified report layout document, then choose **Open**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to import the report layout document that you modified. Otherwise, the new report layout isn't available.

<!--
##  <a name="MakeChangesToLayout"></a> Create and modify custom report layouts

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

### Embedding fonts in Word layouts for consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

###  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields in Word layouts

 Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

 ![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

 The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field you want to delete, then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.  

### Adding data fields

Adding data fields from a report dataset is more advanced and requires some knowledge of the report dataset. Learn more about adding fields for data, labels, and images at [Add Fields to a Word Report Layout](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).  -->

# Set up company consolidation

Before you can consolidate the general ledger entries of two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company, you must prepare the charts of accounts and the consolidation company.  

Depending on the complexity of your businesses, there are two ways to set up consolidation:

* If you don't need advanced settings, such as including a company that you only own part of, you can use the **Company Consolidation** setup guide to quickly set-up a consolidation. The guide helps you through the basic steps.
* If you need more advanced settings, you can set up the consolidated company and business units yourself.
  * In each business unit, specify the general ledger accounts to include in the consolidation and the translation method for each account.
  * In the consolidated company, set up a business unit card for each company to include in the consolidation. The business unit card includes information such as the dates of the business unit's fiscal year, and the percentage of each account to include in the consolidation.

## Simple consolidation setup

If your consolidation is straightforward, for example because you wholly own the business units to consolidate, the **Company Consolidation** guide helps you through the following steps:

* Create a new consolidated company, or consolidate a company you already created. The company shouldn't contain transactions.
* Preview the results. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that you can successfully transfer the master data and transactions to the consolidated company.

To use the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Process Consolidations**, and then complete each step in the Company Consolidation assisted setup guide.

## Advanced consolidation setup

If you need more advanced settings for your consolidation, you can set up consolidation manually. For example, if you have companies that you partially own, or you have companies that you don't want to include.  

### Set up the consolidated company

First, you must set up the consolidated company. You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. To learn more about setting up a company, go to [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

The following list illustrates key aspects of the consolidated company.

1. Set up the chart of accounts.

    To learn more about setting up a chart of accounts, go to [Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

    The charts of accounts can be identical across a business unit and the consolidated company, or the consolidated company can have a different chart of account. If a business unit's chart of accounts differs from the consolidated company's, you must map the accounts to the accounts in the business unit. To learn more, go to the [Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation](#glacc) section.

2. Add business units.

    To consolidate several companies' data, you must set up the subsidiaries as business units and specify how much of their balances to include. To learn more about business units, to go the [Add business units](#busunit) section.

3. Specify exchange rates, if needed.

    Specify exchange rates if you consolidate data for business units that use different currencies. The exchange rates you can use are **Average Rate (Manual)** and **Closing Rate**. To learn more about exchange rates, go to [Specify exchange rates for consolidations](#exchrates).

4. Consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

    To learn more, go to the [Include or exclude dimensions](#dim) section.

### <a name="busunit"></a>Add business units

In the consolidated company, set up each company that you want to consolidate data from as a business unit. Before you run a consolidation and generate your consolidation report, it's a good idea to verify the financial data in each business unit.

A significant part of setting up the business unit is to specify how the unit shares it's financial data with the consolidated company. There are manual and automated options:

* To use a manual process, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises, you can export an .xml file that contains the unit's general ledger entries. Then import the file in the consolidated company.
* To automate the data exchange, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online you can use an API that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides to share data across environments. If your companies are in the same environment, you can use the **Database** option.

> [!NOTE]
> The API option also lets you share general ledger entries from other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. To use the API option, the user who configures the consolidation must have permission to access G/L entries. For example, the D365 Basic and D365 Read permission sets provide access.

#### Set up business unit currencies

When you run consolidation for business units in a foreign currency, pay attention to the exchange rates that various parts of the process use. This is especially true when you rerun consolidation. Use the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page to easily keep track of the rates.

The **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page gives you the last rates for average and closing. You can look up the exchange rates in the currency exchange rate table, which makes it easier to validate rates. You can change the rates for the current run by entering the values or copying them from previous runs. To copy rates, choose **Select from previous consolidation**. This page is valuable when you want to rerun a previous consolidation and use a previous closing rate. This step helps to correctly revaluate your balance sheet items. The **Select from previous consolidation** page is also useful if you just want to view the rates that were used, for example, when you're troubleshooting. The page is filtered to runs that included the selected business unit.

You start the **Run Consolidation** batch job from the **Business Units** list page. You can also find the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page by choosing the **Exchange Rates** action.

> [!NOTE]
> The exchange rate setup pages for average and closing that are currently available on the **Business Unit** card will be deprecated in a future version. However, you can still maintain these rates if you have business units that you import through files.

#### Create a business unit

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields on the **General** and **G/L Accounts** FastTabs. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, make sure you comply with GAAP rules concerning the fiscal periods of the business unit versus the parent company.
4. On the **Data Import** FastTab, in the **Default Data Import** field, specify how you share general ledger entries with the consolidated company:

   * To share data between companies in the same environment, choose **Database**.
   * To share data between companies in different environments, choose **API**, and then fill in the **API's Endpoint** field.
        
        To get the endpoint URL, in the business unit company's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Consolidation Setup Page** and check the Current environment's API Endpoint field value. 
   * To export an .xml file and manually share it, choose **File Format**.

### <a name="glacc"></a>Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation

The chart of accounts for a company that you will consolidate must specify accounts for consolidation. For each posting general ledger account in each company, you must specify the general ledger account in the consolidated company to transfer the balance to. This mapping lets you consolidate companies that have different charts of accounts.

If the chart of accounts in the business unit differs from the consolidated company, you must prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation. You can specify the accounts to post debits and credits to, and the method to use to translate currencies in the consolidated company.

1. In each business unit's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the account, and then fill in the fields on the **Consolidation** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Consol. Debit Acc.** and **Consol. Credit Acc.** fields, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes they're mapped to the same accounts in the consolidated company.

> [!TIP]
> There might be scenarios where you don't want to include an account in a consolidation. For example, if you want your consolidation company to reflect only the balance sheets from the subsidiary companies. To exclude an account from consolidation, turn on the **Exclude from Consolidation** toggle for the account.

### <a name="exchrates"></a>Specify exchange rates for consolidations

If a business unit uses a different currency than the consolidated company, you must specify exchange rate methods for each account before you consolidate. For each account, the content of the **Consol. Translation Method** field determines the exchange rate. In the consolidated company, on each business unit card, in the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field you specify whether consolidation uses exchange rates from the business unit or the consolidated company. If you use exchange rates from the consolidated company, you can change the exchange rates for a business unit. For business units, if the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field on the business unit card contains **Local**, you can change the exchange rate from the business unit card. The exchange rates are copied from the **Currency Exchange Rate** table, but you can change them before consolidating.

The following table describes the exchange rate methods you can use for accounts.

|Exchange rate | Typical use |
|---|---|
|Average Rate (Manual) | You manually calculate the average rate for the period to consolidate. Calculate the average either as an arithmetic average or as a best estimate, and specify the result for each business unit. Use for income statement accounts.|
|Closing Rate | Used for balance sheet accounts.|
|Historical Rate | The exchange rate that was valid when the transaction occurred.|
|Composite Rate | The current period amounts are translated at the average rate and added to the previously recorded balance in the consolidated company. You typically use this method for retained earnings accounts. Those accounts include amounts from different periods, so they contain amounts translated with different exchange rates.|
|Equity Rate | This option is similar to **Composite**. Differences post to separate general ledger accounts.|

To specify exchange rates for a business unit, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Business Unit List** page, choose the business unit, and then choose the **Exchange Rates** action.  
3. On the **Setup Business Unit Currencies** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### <a name="dim"></a>Include or exclude dimensions

You can consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

* On the dimensions, specify the **Consolidation Code** field, or leave it blank.
  * To exclude a dimension in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank on the dimension, and don't choose dimensions in the **Copy Dimensions** fields in any consolidation functions or reports.
  * To include dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank. However, the consolidation works only if the dimension values in the business unit are the same as the consolidated company.
  * To consolidate the dimension value code in the business unit with a different dimension value code in the consolidated company, fill in the **Consolidation Code** field on the dimensions.  
* Add the dimensions to the general ledger accounts.

### <a name="exclude"></a>Exclude a company from consolidation

If you don't want to include a business unit in the consolidation, you can exclude it. To do that, go to the business unit card, and clear the **Consolidate** checkbox.

### <a name="include"></a>Include a partially owned company in consolidation

If you own only part of a company, you can include a percentage of each transaction that reflects the percentage you own. For example, if you own 70% of the company, consolidation includes $70 of an invoice for $100. To specify the percentage of the company you own, go to the business unit card and enter the percentage in the **Consolidation %** field.

# Save and personalize list views

When you set a filter on a list and you want to keep the filter for later, you can save it as a view. To learn more about filtering lists, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).

If views exist, the **Views** group appears at the top of the filter pane. Views are variations of the list that is preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want per list. The views will be available the next time you open the list, from any device or browser.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## To save a view

1. Open any list page.
2. Select ![Filter pane icon.](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.
3. Set one or more new filters. To learn more, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).
4. When you set  the filters, choose the ![Save View.](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon.

    If you set a filter for a list view that was already saved as a view, the existing view updates when you save.
5. If you're saving a new view, enter a name for the view in the **All (Copy)** box, such as "Items I own".
6. To accept the name, select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or move the cursor from the text box.

If you don't give it a name, the default name is **All (Copy)**.

> [!TIP]
> Not seeing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon? To learn more, go to [Why don't I have a Save icon](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-views-faq#save).

## To rename or remove a view

1. For the view that currently displays the list, choose the ![Show more options.](media/show-more-options-icon.png "Show more options") icon to see which options are available.
2. Choose either the **Rename** or the **Remove** action.

## Managing Many Views

As the number of views on a page grows, you might need more control over how views are presented in the filter pane. With the **Personalizing** banner, you can hide unwanted views or reorder your views to get the perfect sequence. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

# Frequently asked questions about the Power BI apps in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses do I need?

To use the Power BI apps, you need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses for the following users:

- Users who install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps.
- Users who refresh the report data.
- Users who access the reports.

Alternatively, you can use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)].

To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central (prerequisites)](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites).

## Why do I need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses?

You must have [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses for the following reasons:

1. You must install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps from Microsoft AppSource.
2. You must share a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace.

The use of free license alternative for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] allows you to embed your own reports. Anything in the free [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] license must be present in your personal [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace. So, the free license alternative does not work with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps.

## Can I install the same app multiple times for different companies or environments?

Yes. Just rename the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace after installing the app.

To learn more, see [Rename a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace](/power-bi/create-reports/service-rename#rename-a-workspace).

## Can I use the same app to do reporting across multiple companies or environments?

No. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## How do I refresh the data in an app?

To learn more, go to [Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)](./across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#get-the-latest-data-refresh-the-semantic-model).

## My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

## I can't see any dimension data in my reports

Check whether the job queue entry for updating dimension set data is stopped.

To learn more, go to [Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#job-queue-entry-for-updating-dimension-set-entries).

## How do I change the connection parameters for an app?

To learn more, go to [Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#connect-the-power-bi-semantic-models-to-business-central).

## How do I update an app?

To learn more, go to [Updating a Power BI app](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#updating-a-power-bi-app).

## Can I get a copy of the source code (.pbix files) for the apps?

No. At the moment, the source code (.pbix files) for the apps isn't available. However, its availability might change in a later release.

## Are the apps available for on-premises installations?

No. At the moment, the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are only available for online environments.

# Create contacts

When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When you convert a contact to a customer, vendor, or employee, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data synchronizes going forward.

## To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

## To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).
>
>Also, you must also have at least one template set up for each of them. For example, to create a customer from a contact, you must have a customer template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronize data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritize if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

## To remove a link between a contact and an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronizes.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, employees, and bank accounts

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronize them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronization between contacts and customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## To view which customer, vendor, employee, or bank account a contact is related to

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a contact, choose the **Related Information** action, and then choose the **Customer/Vendor/Bank Account/Employee** action.

# Analyzing report data with Excel and XML

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

As a developer or advanced user, it helps to inspect the data that is generated for a given report dataset while you create new reports or modify existing ones. To support this capability, you can export a report dataset as raw data to an Excel workbook or XML file&mdash;directly. In Excel, for example, you can then do ad-hoc analysis of the data and diagnose issues.

## Get started

To export a report dataset to an Excel workbook or XML file, open the report in the client, then in the request page, select **Send to** > **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** or **XML Document**. The file downloads to your device.

## More about Excel (data only)

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports the report results and the criteria used to generate them&mdash;but it doesn't include the report layout. The Excel file includes the full dataset, as raw data, arranged in rows and columns. All data columns of the report's dataset are included, regardless of whether they're used in the report layout.

Once you have the Excel file, you can start analyzing the data. For example, you could filter the data and use Power Pivot to display it.

Each time you export results, a new worksheet is created. Using the **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option, you can run the same report and reuse formatting changes. For example, for Power Pivot, you can run the report again for another time period, copy the results to the worksheet, and then refresh the worksheet. You can also find a reporting app on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You can't export a report that has more than 1,048,576 rows or 16,384 columns. With Business Central on-premises, the maximum number of exported rows might be even less. Business Central Server includes a configuration setting, called **Max Data Rows Allowed to Send to Excel**, for decreasing the limit from the maximum value. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General) or contact your administrator.

## For administrators

- **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** was introduced as an optional feature in the 2021 release wave 1, update 18.3. To give users access to this feature when running 2021 release wave 1, enable the **Save report dataset to Microsoft Excel Document** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management). In 2021 release wave 2, this feature became permanent.

- To use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, user accounts need the **Allow Action Export Report Dataset To Excel** permission. You can give users this permission by assigning either the **Troubleshooting Tools** or **Export Report Excel** permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md)  

## For developers and advanced users

The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** option exports all columns, including columns that hold filters and formatting instructions for other values. Here are a few points of interest:

- Binary data in a field, like an image, isn't exported.

  In columns that hold binary data, fields include the text **Binary data ({0} bytes)**, where **{0}** indicates the number of bytes.
- The Excel file also includes the **Report Metadata** worksheet.

  This worksheet shows the filters applied to the report and general report properties, like the name, ID, and extension details. The filters are shown in the **Filter (DataItem::Table::FilterGroupNo::FieldName)** column. The filters in this column include filters set on the report's request page. It also includes filters defined in AL code, for example, by the [DataItemLink property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemlink-reports-property) and [DataItemTableView property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataitemtableview-property).

# Set up reminder terms and levels

You can use reminders to inform customers about overdue amounts and to request payment. [!INCLUDE [reminder-terms](includes/reminder-terms.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you set up reminder terms and levels, you can include them in automated processes for creating, issuing, and sending reminders. To learn more about the automated process, go to [Automate reminders in collections](finance-automate-reminders.md).

## Reminder terms

If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send a reminder. In addition, you might want to debit their accounts for interest or fees. You can set up any number of reminder terms.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to calculate interest on overdue payments, you can do so when you create reminders. If, however, you just want to calculate interest and inform your customers about this without sending a reminder, use a [finance charge memo](finance-setup-finance-charges.md). For more information, see [Reminders](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#reminders) or [Finance Charges](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#finance-charges).

### Set up attachment and email body texts for communications

On the **Reminder Terms Setup** page, you can set up attachment texts and standard email messages to use either for all reminder levels, or create specific messages for each level. For example, the message you send for the first reminder level might have a different tone or content than the second or third. To create attachment and email message texts for all levels, choose **Customer Communication** at the top of the page. To create messages for specific lines, on the **Reminder Level** FastTab, choose a line and then choose the **Customer Communication** action on the FastTab.

By default, attachment and email texts use your language setting. If you issue reminders to customers in other countries, however, you might want to communicate in different languages. You can create texts for each language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports by using the **Add text for language** action. If you do, ensure that the languages are the same for attachment texts and email texts. If they don't match, and the reminder term has more than one level, the automation might not be able to customize the message for one or more levels. To verify that the languages match, use the **Overview communications** action and compare the communications for the texts.

When you send an email, the reminder is a report you attach to the email. You define the report that generates the reminder on the **Report Selection Reminder/Finance Charge** page, where you also select the report that holds the email body text in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. When you send emails to your customers, the texts on the **Email Text** FastTab are inserted in the report selected in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. The standard report has a text field for this text. If you want, you can edit this report, for example, to add or remove content. Edit the layout of these reports on the **Report Layouts** page. To learn more about report layouts, go to [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Communicating by email directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you're set up to do that. To learn more about connecting email accounts with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

### Set up reminder terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To use more than one combination of reminder terms, set up a code for each one.

## Reminder levels

For each reminder term, you can define an unlimited number of reminder levels, though most companies use only two or three levels. The first time a reminder is created for a customer, the setting from level 1 is used. When the reminder is issued, the level number is registered on the reminder entries that are created and linked to the individual customer ledger entries. If it's necessary to remind the customer again, all reminder entries linked to open customer ledger entries are checked to locate the highest level number. The conditions from the next level number will then be used for the new reminder.

If you create more reminders than you define levels for, the conditions for the highest level are used. You can create as many reminders as are allowed by the **Max. No of Reminders** field in the reminder terms.

### To set up reminder levels

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the line with the terms you want to set up levels for, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!TIP]
    > The setting of the **Calculate Interest** field determines if interest will appear on the reminder when the reminder is issued. However, the **Post Interest** field in the **Reminder Terms** page determines if the calculated interest must be posted to G/L and customer accounts.
    >
    > To indicate that interest should be calculated, choose the **Calculate Interest** field.

    Optionally, for each reminder level, specify extra fees in both local and foreign currencies. You can define many extra fees in foreign currencies for each code on the **Reminder Levels** page.  

    The extra fees can be calculated in three different ways that are defined by the value of the **Add. Fee Calculation Type** field.  

    - **Fixed**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the **Additional Fee** fields on the line for the reminder level itself.  
    - **Single Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the relevant line in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.
    - **Accumulated Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the combined lines in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.

4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Reminder Levels** page, define for each reminder level code and corresponding reminder level number a currency code and an extra fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create reminders in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create reminders. If there are no foreign currency reminder conditions set up, the LCY reminder conditions that are set up on the **Reminder Levels** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each reminder level, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the reminder.

6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill in the **Reminder Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the reminder text, you can enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.  

    |Placeholder|Value|  
    |-----------------|-----------|  
    |%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
    |%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the reminder header|  
    |%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
    |%8|Content of the **Reminder Level** field on the reminder header|  
    |%9|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the reminder header|  
    |%10|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%11|The company name|  
    |%12|Content of the **Add. Fee per Line** field on the reminder header|  

    For example, if you write **You owe %9 %7 due on %2.**, the reminder contains the following text: **You owe USD 1.200,50 due on 02-02-2024.**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the due date according to the date formula that you enter. For more information, see [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

8. To specify the language for an email message, choose the **Add text for language** action. The **Language Code** field updates to show your selection. On the **Email Text** FastTab, enter the content of the message in the selected language.

After you set up the reminder terms, you can assign them to customers on Customer Card pages. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

# Set up contact sync with Outlook for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In this article, you learn how to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to synchronize contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with contacts in Outlook. For more information the feature, go to [Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook](admin-synchronize-outlook-contacts.md).

## Introduction

Contact synchronization requires using the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with Exchange Online. Previously, basic authentication was also supported, but it's been deprecated and no longer supported with Exchange Online. You can read more about the deprecation at [Deprecation of Basic authentication in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online). This change means that contact synchronization in Business Central may have stopped working on your on-premises environment. This article will explain how to get it working again.

## Prerequisites

- Exchange Online, either a standalone version or through Microsoft 365 plan  
- Access to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Exchange Online
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users have a Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online email account, which is assigned to their accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of user profile in the **Users** list. 

## Set up contact sync

Complete the following steps to set up contact sync. If you're running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (v.14), you'll have to do an extra step that either modifies application code or sets up a connection to Power BI.

1. <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app for Exchange Online API in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

   In this step, you add a registered app in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, Exchange Online requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and Exchange Online.

   Follow the detailed instructions in the developer and IT pro help at [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory). As you go through the instructions, remember the following points:

   - If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set up the app with the Office 365 Exchange Online permissions described in the next bullet.

   - Configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the Office 365 Exchange Online API:

     - Contacts.ReadWrite
     - EWS.AccessAsUser.All

2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 14, do one of the following tasks:

   - Modify page 6700 by changing `FALSE` to `TRUE` in the following line of code in the `OnPageOpen` trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Create new page with the following code on the OnPageOpen trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Set up Power BI by following the instructions at [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](across-working-with-business-central-in-powerbi.md).

   After the solution you choose is in place, ask users to either run the new/modified page or [connect to Power BI](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect). They'll only need to do this step once.

# Delivering Service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you deliver service according to the contracts that you have created and the service orders that you have committed to fulfilling. Your service technicians or dispatcher will find outstanding service orders easy to locate when they use the **Dispatch Board**. At a glance, the **Dispatch Board** shows which orders are in progress and which orders are complete.  
  
Another way to review pending service orders is to use the **Service Tasks** page. In this view of your service obligations, you can see where in your service workflow an order is and change that status to reflect interactions with your customer.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.   

A service management application must interface with a customer request for service. That service request usually is translated into a service order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides tools to create an order both directly in response to a customer request or as part of the contract process, if that is how your application is set up.  
  
If needed, you can manage a loaner program for your customers. You can also determine your pricing structure, put service pricing offerings into logical groupings, and create price adjustments.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Searching for Customers, Vendors, and Other Contacts from Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]. Introduced in 2021 release wave 1.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a comprehensive business contact management system that is essential for users in sales, operations, or other departmental roles. If you're a user in one of these roles, you'll often need to look up, meet, or start a conversation with your vendors, customers, and other contacts. With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can do these tasks directly from Teams, without having to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From within Teams, you can:

- Look up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts from the Teams command box or from the message compose area. Contacts can include prospects, vendors, customers, or other business relationships.
- Share a contact as a card in a Teams conversation.
- View details about the contact, interaction history, and other insights like outstanding payments or open documents.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)
- You've got a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account with access to contacts in at least one company.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you searching from the command box or message compose box, you may be asked to sign in or set up the app the first time. This step is necessary to search for contacts in the right Business Central company. Learn more about setting up the app to choose your company in [Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams](across-teams-settings.md).

## Look up contacts from the command box

The command box is at the top of every screen in Teams. It lets you search, take quick actions, or launch apps, like the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. Searching from the command box is great for quickly looking up contacts and their related data for your own use. For example, suppose you want to look up an email address of a vendor to set up a calendar meeting. Or maybe you want to look up interaction history during a meeting with a customer.

1. In the command box, type **/Business Central**, then select the Business Central app from the results.

    ![Open Business Central app  to search for contacts from command box.](media/teams-contacts-command-1b.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search Business Central contacts from command box in Teams.](media/teams-contacts-command-3.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears beneath the command box.

4. If you want to add the contact card into a conversation, go to the upper right corner of the card, select **... (More options)** > **Copy**. Then, paste the copy in the message compose box of a conversation.  

Learn more about the Teams command box at [Teams - Use the command box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-command-box-13c4e429-7324-4886-b377-5dbed539193b).

## Look up contacts from the message compose box

The advantage of using the message compose box is that you can add a contact card directly to a conversation, for others to see.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+** and then select **Business Central** from the list to launch the app.

    ![Open Business Central app to search for contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-message-box-2.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search for Business Central contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-6.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears in the message compose box.

> [!NOTE]
> The contact card isn't sent to the conversation right away for others to see. You have the opportunity to review the contents of the card, and add text before or after it as you like. Then, send your message to the chat when ready.

## Viewing contact card details

The contact card in Teams gives you a quick overview of the customer, vendor, or contact. The card is interactive&mdash;meaning you can view more information or even modify a contact by using the **Details** or **Pop-out** buttons.

The **Details** button opens a window within Teams that displays more information about the contact, but not as much as you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To see all the information about a contact in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Pop-out**.

The contact card works just like cards for records, like items, customers, or sales orders. Learn more in [View card details](across-working-with-teams.md#view-card-details).

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central contact that you submit to a conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:  

quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.

# Set Up Standard Service Codes

When you perform typical service, you often have to create service documents that use service lines that contain similar information. To make it easy to create these lines, you can set up standard service codes that have a predefined set of service lines. When you choose the code on a service document, the lines are entered automatically. You can set up any number of standard service codes, and each code can have an unlimited number of service lines of different types, including item, resource, cost, or standard text linked to it. You create service lines of each standard service code on the **Standard Service Code** card. You then assign standard service codes to service item groups on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page. Later, when you create a service document, you can use the **Get Standard Service Codes** action to add service lines.  
  
> [!Tip]
> You can use the same concept to create lines on sales and purchase documents. For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).  
  
## To set up a standard service code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Service Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.  

## To assign a standard service code to a service item group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service item Groups**, and then choose the related link.

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

5. Leave the **Row Definition** and **Column Definition** fields blank.

## Set up row definition lines

After a financial report name is set up, Ken defines each line in the cash flow financial report. Ken defines lines to be shown in reports in addition to lines that are only for calculation purposes.  

### Set up row definition lines  

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report you created, then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.  
2. On the **Row Definition** page, enter each line as shown in the following table.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Use the **Insert CF Accounts** function to quickly mark, in the cash flow accounts chart, the cash flow accounts you want and copy them to row definition lines.

The row number R50 is used to capture the sum of cash surplus. The row number R60 is used to capture the liquid funds. The row number R70 is used to calculate the forecasted cash flow.

## Set up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|

## Assig the column definition to the financial report name

Ken is now ready to assign the column definition to the financial report name.  

### Assign the column definition to the financial report name

1. In the **Financial Reports** page, select the **Forecast** financial report, then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.  
2. In the **Name** field, choose the column definition **Cash Flow** to assign as the default column definition.  

## View and print the cash flow forecast

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **Forecast** financial report [Financial analytics overview](bi.md)  to view the cash flow forecast.  
2. On the **Financial Report** page, you can select an amount and then view the cash flow forecast entries that make up the amount. In addition, you can view the formula used to calculate that amount. You can also filter the amounts by date and dimension.  
3. Choose the **Print** action to print the cash flow forecast.

# Working with Microsoft Excel layouts

Microsoft Excel report layouts are based on Excel workbooks (.xlsx files). With them, you can create reports that include familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data such as formulas, PivotTables, and PivotCharts.

![Shows an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)

This article explains some important things you need to know to get started with Excel layouts.

## Why use Excel layouts?

Benefits of using Excel layouts:

- You can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.
- An Excel report layout can contain multiple worksheets, be interactive and use visualizations, pivot tables, and slicers.
- View raw data from the report dataset, which helps you understand how the report works and where the data in visuals comes from.
- Use built-in Microsoft Office features to do post-processing on rendered reports, including:
  - [Protecting worksheets](https://support.microsoft.com/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6)
  - [Applying sensitivity labels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9)
  - [Adding comments and notes](https://support.microsoft.com/office/insert-comments-and-notes-in-excel-65f504d8-160b-4a05-ac30-46fbd5227a52)
  - [Forecasting and analysis](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4)
- Use installed add-ins and app integrations, such as Power Automate flows or OneDrive.

> [!TIP]
> With OneDrive integration set up, when you run a report with an Excel layout, the Excel workbook file is copied to OneDrive and then opened in Excel online. For more information, see [Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive](./across-onedrive-overview.md#save-excel-workbooks-and-report-files-in-onedrive)

## Get started

There are basically two tasks involved in setting up an Excel layout for a report:

1. Create the new Excel layout file.
2. Add the new layout to the report.

## Task 1: Create the Excel layout file

There are several ways to create an Excel layout file for a report:

* From any report.
* From an existing Excel report layout.
* From Visual Studio Code.

### [From any report](#tab/any-report)

Follow these steps to create an Excel layout from any report, regardless of the current layout type. The Excel layout contains the required **Data** sheet and table, and a **Report Metadata** sheet.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Send to**, then **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, and then **OK**.

   This step downloads an Excel workbook that contains the report dataset.
4. Open the downloaded file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From another Excel report layout](#tab/other-layout)

If there's already an Excel layout for a report, you can use the existing layout as a starting point. There are two approaches to getting a copy of the layout. You can either export the existing layout from the **Report Layouts** page or download the layout from the report's request page. Both ways download an Excel layout file that includes all the sheets of the existing file. The difference is when you download it from the request page, the layout includes actual data. The data isn't required, but it helps when you design the layout.

**Approach 1: Export the layout from the Report Layouts page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the Excel layout from the list, and then choose the **Export Layout** action.
3. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

**Approach 2: Download the layout from the report's request page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, and then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Download**.
4. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From Visual Studio Code](#tab/from-code)

Using Visual Studio Code is the most advanced way to create an Excel report layout. It requires knowledge of AL code and is intended for programmers. In this approach, the Excel layouts are part of an extension package you install. Learn more at [Creating an Excel Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

---

## Task 2: Add the Excel layout to the report

When you have the Excel layout file, the next task is to add it as a new layout for the report.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Choose **New Layout**.
3. Set **Report ID** to **Report**.
4. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a name.
5. In the **Format Options** field, choose **Excel**.
6. Select **OK**, and then do one of the following steps to upload the layout file for the report:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

   The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and the **Report Layouts** page opens.
8. To review the report in the new layout, choose the layout from the list, and then select **Run Report**.

<!--

**Data** sheet
  - An Excel layout must contain a sheet named **Data**.
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.

**Data** table
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.
  - The table must have at least one column and can only include columns that are also in the report dataset.
  - The table must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.

3. Report metadata 
-->

## Understanding Excel layouts

There are a few things you need to know or consider when you create or change Excel layouts. Every Excel layout must have a **Data** sheet and a **Data** table. These elements define the business data that you can work with from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Data** sheet links the layout to the business data, which is the basis for the calculations and visualizations that you present on other sheets.

For the layout to work, there are some requirements to the structure of the Excel workbook that must be met. The following diagram and table outline the elements of an Excel layout and the requirements.

[![Shows the different elements of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png)](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png#lightbox)

|No.|Element|Description|Mandatory|
|---|-------|----|---|
|1|**Data** sheet|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Can only include one table, which must be named **Data**.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png) | 
|2|**Data** table|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Must have at least one column.</li><li>Can only include columns that are in the report dataset.</li><li>Must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png)|
|3|Presentation sheets|<ul><li>Used to present data.</li><li>Data comes from the **Data** sheet. </li></ul>||
|4|**Report Metadata** sheet|<ul><li>Automatically included if the layout was created by exporting another Excel report.</li><li>Contains general information about the report.</li><li>Can be deleted.</li></ul>|

In summary, you can or shouldn't do the following things on the **Data** sheet:

- You can delete or hide columns.
- You can place the sheets in any order, with the **Data** sheet first or last.
- Don't change the name of **Data** sheet, **Data** table, or columns.
- Don't add any columns unless they're included in the report dataset.

# Design Details: Assembly Order Posting
Assembly order posting is based on the same principles as when posting the similar activities of sales orders and production consumption/output. However, the principles are combined in that assembly orders have their own posting UI, like that for sales orders, while the actual entry posting happens in the background as direct item and resource journal postings, like that for production consumption, output, and capacity.  

Similarly to production order posting, the consumed components and the used resources are converted and output as the assembly item when the assembly order is posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.  

The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting:  

-   The item journal posts positive item ledger entries, representing output of the assembly item, from the assembly order header  
-   The item journal posts negative item ledger entries, representing consumption of assembly components, from the assembly order lines.  
-   The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources (time units), from the assembly order lines.  
-   The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage, from the assembly order lines.  

The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting.  

![Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_1.png "Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly.  

The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting:  

![Assembly-related entry flow during posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_2.png "AAssembly-related entry flow during posting")  

## Posting Sequence  
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order:  

1.  The assembly order lines are posted.  
2.  The assembly order header is posted.  

The following table outlines the sequence of actions.  

|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Initialize Posting|1.  Make preliminary checks.<br />2.  Add posting number and modify the assembly order header.<br />3.  Release the assembly order.|  
|Post|<ol><li>Create the posted assembly order header.</li><li>Copy comment lines.</li><li>Post assembly order lines (consumption):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Create a status page to calculate assembly consumption.</li><li>Get the remaining quantity on which the item journal line will be based.</li><li>Reset the consumed and remaining quantities.</li><li>For assembly order lines of type Item:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li></ol></li><li>For assembly order lines of type Resource:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line. This creates capacity ledger entries.</li><li>Create and post resource journal line.</li></ol></li><li>Transfer field values from the assembly order line into a newly created posted assembly order line.</li></ol></li><li>Post the assembly order header (output):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li><li>Reset the assembly quantities and remaining quantities.</li></ol></li></ol>|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unlike for production output, which is posted at expected cost, assembly output is posted at actual cost.  

## Cost Adjustment  
 Once an assembly order is posted, meaning that components (material) and resources are assembled into a new item, then it should be possible to determine the actual cost of that assembly item, and the actual inventory cost of the components involved. This is achieved by forwarding costs from the posted entries of the source (the components and resources) to the posted entries of the destination (the assembly item). The forwarding of costs is done by calculating and generating new entries, called adjustment entries that become associated with the destination entries.  

 The assembly costs to be forwarded are detected with the Order Level detection mechanism. For information about other adjustment detection mechanisms, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).  

### Detecting the Adjustment  
The order Level detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

-   Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
-   Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted.  

![Assembly-related entry flow during cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Assembly-related entry flow during posting")  

### Performing the Adjustment  
The spreading of detected adjustments from material and resource costs onto the assembly output entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job. It contains the Make Multilevel Adjustment function, which consists of the following two elements:  

-   Make Assembly Order Adjustment – which forwards cost from material and resource usage to the assembly output entry. Lines 5 and 6 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  
-   Make Single Level Adjustments – which forwards costs for individual items using their costing method. Lines 9 and 10 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  

![Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_4.jpg "Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Make WIP Adjustments element, in lines 7 and 8, is responsible for forwarding production material and capacity usage to the output of unfinished production orders. This is not used when adjusting assembly order costs as the concept of WIP does not apply to assembly.  

For information about how costs from assembly and production are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Assembly Costs are Always Actual  
 The concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly order posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

This is enabled by the following data structure.  

-   In the **Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Resource* is used to identify assembly resource entries.  
-   In the **Item Ledger Entry Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Assembly Output* and *Assembly Consumption* are used to identify the output assembly item entries and the consumed assembly component entries respectively.  

In addition, posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows.  

|Entity|Type|Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|  
|Assembly Order Header|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Resource||Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  

Accordingly, only actual costs are posted to the general ledger, and no interim accounts are populated from assembly order posting. For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md)  

## Assemble to Order  
The item ledger entry that results from posting an assemble-to-order sale is fixed applied to the related item ledger entry for the assembly output. Accordingly, the cost of an assemble-to-order sale is derived from the assembly order that it was linked to.  

Item ledger entries of type Sale that result from posting assemble-to-order quantities are marked with **Yes** in the **Assemble to Order** field.  

Posting sales order lines where a part is inventory quantity and another part is assemble-to-order quantity results in separate item ledger entries, one for the inventory quantity and one for the assemble-to-order quantity.  

### Posting dates

In general, posting dates are copied from a sales order to the linked assembly order. The posting date in the assembly order is automatically updates when you change the  posting date in the sales order directly or indirectly, such as if you change the posting date in the wareshouse shippment, inventory pick, or as part of a bulk posting.

You can change the posting date in the assembly order manually. However, it can not be later then posting date in the linked sales order. The system will keep this date unless you update the posting date in the sales order.

# Post Capacities

In the capacity journal, you post consumed capacities that are not assigned to the production order. For example, maintenance work must be assigned to capacity, but not to a production order.  

## To post capacities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.  
3. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the capacity, either **Machine Center** or **Work Center**, that you are posting.  
4. In the **No.** field, enter the number of the machine center or work center.  
5. Enter the relevant data in the other fields, such as **Starting Time**, **Ending Time**, **Quantity**, and **Scrap**.  
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the capacities.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view work center ledger entries  

In the **Work Center Card** and **Machine Center Card** pages, you can view the posted capacities as a result of finished production orders.    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant **Work Center** card from the list, and then choose the **Capacity Ledger Entries** action.  

    The **Capacity Ledger Entries** page displays the posted entries from the work center in the order they were posted.

# Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse
1. Open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, and then turn off the **Enabled** toggle. Then close the page to disconnect from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, and in the **Ownership Model** field, choose **Person**. Then choose the **Enabled** toggle to turn on the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to Dataverse.
4. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** to reinstall the Business Central Integration Solution.
5. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to reconnect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This enables integration with tables that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as sales orders, quotes, and invoices.
6. On the **Sales Connection Setup** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup** to initialize the integration table mappings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Using the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action will apply the default integration table mappings. All custom mappings will be overwritten. If you have custom mappings that you want to keep, we recommend that you export them to Excel or talk to your Microsoft partner about other ways to keep your custom mappings.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| | **Current Assets**| Formula | |Balance at Date    | Yes |
|CA | Cash                | Posting Accounts | 18000..18999 |Balance at Date|     |

|CA |  Other Receivables  | Posting Accounts | 13000..13999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA | Inventory           | Posting Accounts | 14000..14999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Prepaid Expenses     | Posting Accounts | 16000..16999 |Balance at Date|    |

|F1 | **Total Current Assets**  | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   |                           | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   | **Long Term Assets**      |            |              |Balance at Date|Yes |
|LTA|Fixed Assets         | Posting Accounts| 10000..12899  |Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Accumulated Depreciation| Posting Accounts|12900..12999|Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Other Long Term Assets | Posting Accounts|17000..17999|19000..19999|Balance at Date|
|F2 |**Total Long Term Assets**|Formula     |   LTA         |Balance at Date | Yes |
|   |                          | Formula    |               |Balance at Date |     |
|F3 | **Total Assets**         |            | F1+F2         | Balance at Date|     |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |
|Description  | Used to hold the words to label each row of the report.        |
|Totaling type| Formula is used in three ways:<br><br>* To add the results of rows together.<br><br>* When combined with a section header or total.<br><br>* When inserting a blank row into the report.<br><br> Posting accounts are used to indicate that the row pulls the result of posted transactions based on the accounts listed in the Totaling column. |
|Totaling | Contains either a range of accounts shown as 10000..11999, or multiple nonconsecutive ranges of accounts shown as 17000..17999\|19000..19999.<br><br> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as CA, which adds all accounts with Row No. of CA.<br><br> Following the general accounting convention of displaying financial report lines in the order of liquidity, general ledger accounts initially appear out of order. Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|
|Posted documents|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|Posted direct transfer|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|
|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Create prepayment invoices

If you require customers to pay before you'll ship their order, you can use the prepayment features. The same applies if your vendor requires you to pay before they ship an order to you.  

You can start the prepayment process when you create a sales or purchase order. The default prepayment percentage for an item on the order, or for the customer or vendor, will be included in the prepayment invoice. You can also specify a prepayment percentage to the entire document.

After you create a sales or purchase order, you can create a prepayment invoice for it. Either use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or adjust the amount. For example, you might specify a total amount for the entire order.  

The following procedure describes how to invoice a prepayment for a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase orders.  

## To create a prepayment invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new sales order for the relevant customer. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

    On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment %** field specifies the percentage to use to calculate the prepayment amount. If there's a default prepayment percentage on the customer card, the field is filled in automatically. You can change the percentage. <!--This percentage is applied to lines where the item on that line does not already specify a prepayment percentage. The prepayment percentage is only copied from the header to lines that do not copy the default prepayment percentage from the item.-->  

    Choose the **Compress Prepayment** field if you want to create lines on the prepayment invoice that combine lines from the sales order if:  

    - They have the same general ledger account for prepayments as determined by the general posting setup.  
    - They have the same dimensions.  

    If you want to specify a prepayment invoice with one line for each sales order line that has a prepayment percentage, don't choose the **Compress Prepayment** field.  

    The due date for the prepayment is calculated automatically based on the value of the **Prepmt. Payment Terms Code**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When some lines on an invoice require 100% prepayment and other lines don't, and there's VAT on the prepayment account, the rounded amount might cause an error when you create a prepayment invoice. The error occurs because the prepayment invoice amount is higher than the amounts on the document lines. To fix the problem, change the amounts on one or all of the lines that require 100% prepayment. The change will recalculate the VAT amount rounding and use the accumulated rounding difference on the last modified line.
    >
    > Two more ways to fix the problem are:
    >
    > * Create a separate VAT product posting group and a VAT posting setup with a separate VAT identifier and use that for the items or lines that require 100% prepayment. Rounding is done for each VAT identifier, so separate rounding will be done for items that are assigned to the VAT product posting group.
    > * Use a separate invoice for the items or lines that do and don't require 100% prepayments.

3. Fill in the sales lines.  

    If you've specified a default prepayment percentage either for the customer or on the **Prepayment** FastTab on this document, this value is copied to each line. You can change the contents of the **Prepayment %** field on the line.  

    > [!TIP]
    > If you do not see the **Prepayment %** field, you can add it through personalization.  For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

4. To view the total prepayment amount, choose the **Statistics** action.

    If you want to adjust the total prepayment amount for the order, you can change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field on the **Sales Order Statistics** page.  

    If the **Prices Including VAT** field is selected, the **Prepayment Amount Incl. VAT** field is editable.  

    If you change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field, the amount will be distributed proportionately between all lines, except lines that have **0** in the **Prepayment %** field.  

5. To print a test report before posting the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Prepayment Test Report** action.  
6. To post the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action.  

    To post and print the prepayment invoice, choose the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  

You can issue other prepayment invoices for the order. To issue another invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines, adjust the document date if necessary, and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced so far and the new prepayment amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are located in North America, you cannot change the prepayment percentage after the prepayment invoice has been posted. This is prevented in the North American version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because the calculation of sales tax will otherwise be incorrect.  

 When you're ready to post the rest of the invoice, post it as you would post any invoice, and the prepayment amount will automatically be deducted from the amount due.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# The PayPal Payments Standard extension

The PayPal Payments Standard extension can help you increase your customer service levels by making it easier for your customers to pay their bills.

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, customers can pay through their PayPal account. When you send a sales invoice by email, there's a PayPal link in the email body and in the attached PDF document. If the customer chooses the link, the service page for their PayPal account opens and shows the payment details. The customer can then pay the invoice as any other PayPal payment.

The PayPal Payments Standard service provides the following benefits:

* Customer payments arrive faster in your bank account.
* Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
* PayPal offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on web sites.
* PayPal offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, PayPal accounts, and other sources.
* The PayPal link can be added automatically to sales documents or manually by the user.
* The PayPal Payments Standard service doesn't involve monthly fees or setup fees.
* Because it's an extension, you can easily enable the PayPal Payment Standard service when and if your business requires it.  

To learn more about how to set up the extension, go to [Enable Customer Payment Through PayPal](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

## Register payments automatically for business accounts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can register payments automatically if you have a Business Merchant account for the PayPal Commerce Platform. When your customers use the PayPal link to pay an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts the entries and close the document.

To use this capability, on the **Payment Registration Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Register payments automatically** toggle and verify the accounts you'll use for the payments. If you decide that you don't want to register payments automatically, you can turn it off again.

> [!TIP]
> Developers can use sandbox accounts to test the setup. To do that, change the PayPal URL to **sandbox.paypal.com**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the PayPals Instant Payment Notification (IPN) through notify_url.

# Design Details: Item Tracking
As the flow of goods in today's supply chain becomes more and more complex, the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important to the companies involved. Monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement in the business of medical and chemical supply, but other businesses may want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.  

An item tracking system should provide a company with easy handling of serial and lot numbers, considering each unique piece of merchandise: when and where received, where stored, when and where sold. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has gradually expanded its coverage of this business requirement and today provides application-wide functionality and a solid core on which to develop extensions.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Create Service Orders
You can use the **Service Order** page to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request.  

When creating a service order, you only have to fill in a few fields. Some fields are optional and many are automatically filled in when you fill in related fields.  

## To create a service order    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  

     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders on the **Service Management Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service order number.  

4. In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list. The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  

5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Management Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
7. Register the service item lines.  

## To create a service order from a contract  
You can automatically create service orders for the maintenance of service items based on service contracts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Contract Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Service Contract Header** FastTab, set the filters you want to apply.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields with the starting date and ending date for the period that you want to create contract service orders for. The batch job creates service orders that include service items in service contracts with next planned service dates within this period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There is a limit to the number of days you can use as the date range each time you use this batch job. You set this limit in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field on the **Service Management Setup** page.  

4. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Service Order**.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You will not be able to create order with multiple service item, if you set **One Service Item Line/Order** field on the **Service Management Setup** page. 

## To convert a service quote to a service order
When a customer has accepted a service quote, you convert it to a service order. The quote is deleted and a new service order is set up with the same description as the service quote. The response date and time are recalculated for the service order and the status is set to **Pending**. The repair status of the service items in the order are changed to **Initial**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for allocation entries for all the service items in the service quote that have the status **Active**. If it finds such allocation entries, their allocation status is updated to **Reallocation Needed**. When you reallocate the service items in the service order, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote are updated to **Finished**.   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service quote to convert to a service order.  
3. Choose the **Make Order** action.  

## To check item availability for one or more orders  
You can check and see if an item you need to fulfill an order is in stock, and if it is not, when the item will be in stock. In addition, if an item is available to reserve, you can reserve it to make sure it is available for your use. You can check availability for a particular order, or for all orders.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following:  

    * For a particular order, choose the order, and then choose the **Demand Overview** action.  
    * For all orders, choose **Show Document**. The **Service Order** page opens.  

3. On the **Demand Overview** page, expand the item grouping, and view information about the availability of the item. For example, you can see how many items are in inventory. You can also see if and when an item will be available if it is on back order, that is, Source Type = Purchase, or whether it has been reserved.

## To reserve an item for a service order
If you need to be sure that an item is available for a service order, you can reserve the item.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. On the **Service Lines** page, choose the item to reserve, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. On the **Reservation** page, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.

## To insert lines based on standard service codes  
If you have set up standard service codes and assigned them to service item groups, you can insert the standard lines linked to the standard service codes on service documents. For more information, see [Set Up Standard Service Codes](service-how-setup-service-coding.md).   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary..  
4. Fill in the service item lines with the required information.  
5. Choose the line with the service item that you want to create service lines for, and then choose **Get Std. Service Codes**. The **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page opens with the standard codes for the service item group specified on the line.  
6. Choose the appropriate code, and choose the **OK** button to enter standard service lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **Service Item Group Code** field on the service item line of the document is blank, this means that the service item does not belong to any service item group. In this case, the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page will contain a list of all standard service codes. You should select from the list to insert standard service lines in the document. You may also select from the list of standard service codes assigned to a specific service item group. To view the list, select the relevant code in the **Service Item Group Code** field on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page.  

## To register internal or public comments
You can add comments that will be printed on service orders and service quotes to provide additional information. You can add up to 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, choose another line. To register a comment, choose a line, and then choose the **Comments** action.  

## To delete invoiced service orders  
Orders are usually deleted automatically after having been fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. The posted document can be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoice** page.  

Service orders are not deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order has been posted not from the service order itself, but from the **Service Invoice** page. Then you may need to delete invoiced orders that were not deleted. You can do this by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Service Orders**, and then choose the related link. The **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job request page opens.  
2. To select the orders to be deleted, you can set filters in the **No.**, **Customer No.**, and **Bill-to Customer No.** fields.  
3. Choose **OK**.

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify which items aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Category
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# FAQ for marketing text suggestions with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is item marketing text suggestions?

Copilot provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as copy) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature is known as [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as *copy*) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The feature is available on any item card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To use it, just open an item and then select **Marketing Text** > **Draft with Copilot**. This action automatically generates a text suggestion that's engaging, creative, and specific to the item that's shown. Suggestions are based on various inputs, including:

- The item's attributes, category, and name.
- Personal writing style preferences, like tone of voice, emphasized quality, format and length.

You can change the value of these input options to influence the outcome of the AI-generated text. Before you save a suggestion, you can easily review and edit it for accuracy or try another suggestion.

Some key benefits of this feature include:

- Decreases the time used on copy writing, which can accelerate time-to-market for items being sold in online shops.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing material for product lines.

## What are the system's capabilities?

The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to access powerful language models that analyze and generate natural language. These models have been trained on a wide body of text datasets. As a result, Copilot can generate suggested, personalized responses in English based on a minimal amount of input data, like an item's attributes, category, or description. Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service at [Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

## What is the system's intended use?

This feature is intended to assist users in creating marketing text for items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Writers use the feature to quickly get compelling and engaging text suggestions, which are then reviewed and edited for accuracy. 

## How was item marketing text evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous texts in different languages were evaluated by language experts against various criteria. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious product catalogs.
- This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure Copilot capabilities remain operational and generate content of the highest quality.

- Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to report inappropriate content and improve the functionality.

  - If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). 

    Microsoft might disable the Copilot-driven features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

  - We track user feedback on [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] to help us improve suggestions. 

    You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We gather the telemetry of these gestures for each AI output that you submit feedback for.

# Assemble Items

If the **Replenishment System** field on the item card contains **Assembly**, the default method of supplying the item is to assemble it according to an assembly BOM, and potentially by a specific resource. Learn more at [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). Learn more about how to set up an assembly item at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

You can set up assembly items for two assembly processes.

|Process  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assemble to stock     | Items that you assemble and stock for future sales. For example, kits for an upcoming sales campaign. The items aren't related to a sales order, at least not yet. Typically, these items aren't customized for customer requests.        |
|Assemble to order     | Items that you don't want to stock. For example, because they're customized based on customer orders or to reduce the cost of on-hand inventory. |
  
This article describes the standard settings for assemble to stock. There might be other ways that are more suited for your business though. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md) and [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Assembly components are handled in a special way in basic warehouse configurations. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

## To assemble an item to stock

Follow the steps in this procedure to assemble an item to stock. To learn about assemble to order, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **New Assembly Order** page opens.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Item No.** field, select the item that you want to assemble. You can select items that are set up for assembly and have an assembly BOM, or items without an assembly BOM. The latter is useful for unplanned assemblies or scenarios when you want to use item reclassification and track costs.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the item that you want assembled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components are not available to fulfill quantity on the due date, the **Assembly Availability** page opens. The page shows how many assembly items can be assembled based on component availability. Learn more at [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md). When you close the page, the assembly order is created with availability alerts on the lines for the affected components.  

    The lines contain the contents of the assembly BOM and the specified quantities.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Assembly Availability** page opened when you filled in the assembly order header, each affected assembly order line contains a **Yes** in the **Avail. Warning** field with a link to detailed availability information. <!--check whether this field help is useful For more information, see Check Availability.--> You can resolve a component availability issue by:

    > * Postponing the starting date.
    > * Replacing the component with another item.
    > * Selecting an available substitution if one is defined.  

6. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, enter how many units of the assembly item that you want to post as output the next time you post the assembly order. This quantity can be lower than the value in the **Quantity** field to reflect a partial output posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To make sure that component consumption posting matches the assembly item output posting, the quantity fields in the assembly order lines automatically adjust to the value that you enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field.  
7. On assembly order lines of type **Item** or **Resource**, in the **Quantity to Consume** field, specify how many units you want to post as consumed the next time that you post the assembly order.
8. When you are ready to partially or fully post, choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If warnings are still present in the assembly order lines, you can't post the order. A message displays the component or components that are not in inventory.  

After posting succeeds, the assembly item is posted as output to the location code and potential bin code that are defined on the assembly order. For manually created assembly orders, the location may be copied from the **Default Location for Orders** setup field. For assemble-to-order flows, the location code may be copied from the sales order line.

# Design details: Creating warehouse entries

Warehouse entries contain information about item movements within the warehouse. For example, you create entries when you post a warehouse journal, or any transaction that moves items from one place to another. Each transaction can create several warehouse entries and warehouse register records. Warehouse register records have the first and last warehouse entry numbers. This information lets you identify the warehouse entries that a particular action created. And, conversely, each warehouse entry has a field that points to the warehouse register.

The following image illustrates the relationship between warehouse registers and warehouse entries for three transactions.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the relations between warehouse register records and warehouse entries.":::

## Creating warehouse transactions

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates warehouse transactions, it checks the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key to determine how to assign entry numbers to warehouse register records and warehouse entries.

### If the feature key is turned off

If the feature key is turned off, both tables are locked. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in both tables and assigns a number that is one digit higher. For example, if the last entry number is 10, then it assigns the number 11. This method of assignment ensures that warehouse entry numbers are consecutive in the warehouse register, but it blocks other users from registering warehouse transactions.

### If the feature key is turned on

If the feature key is turned on, which it is by default, entry numbers in both tables are assigned from `SequenceNumbers` in the database to allow users to register warehouse transactions at the same time. Using sequence numbers might cause warehouse entry numbers from two or more transactions to overlap, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries 2.png" alt-text="Diagram shows how warehouse register records and warehouse entries can overlap.":::

## When to turn off the feature key

You might want to turn off the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key if you work with a feature or extension that extends warehouse management and the following are true:

* The feature relies on consecutive entry numbers.
* The feature locks tables during a process.

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and non-transactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Using a pull model, subsidiaries pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you won't be able to complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that will be the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you haven't set that up yet. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you'll pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will find the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization get's stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain non-transactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. This helps prevented unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Delete** action.

## Use export and import to share a synchronization setup

If you're setting up several subsidiaries that use the same or similar synchronization settings, there's a time saver. Set up one subsidiary company and then export its setup to an .xml file. The file contains the entire setup, including table and field mappings and filter criteria. You can then import the file to the next subsidiary. To import or export a setup, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, use the **Import** or **Export** actions.

# Audit changes to your setup

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to configure your system in many ways. This article explains ways to monitor changes to your setup for financial auditing.

## Set up the Change Log to capture changes

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes to your setup. For example, you can find out what changed, who changed it, and when the change was made.

To use the Change Log to monitor your setup, you must specify the tables you want it to monitor. The following table lists some examples of finance setup tables where you might want to setup change tracking. To learn more about the Change Log, go to [Log changes](across-log-changes.md).

| If you want to audit changes to... | Table | Table ID | Learn more... |

## Get notified when system setup change

To add an extra layer of security to your setup, you can monitor changes to fields and get an email when someone changes a value. To learn more, go to [Monitor sensitive fields](across-log-changes.md#monitor-sensitive-fields).

## Analyze changes to your setup

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

# Setting Up Relationship Management

Before you get started working with your contacts and marketing interests, there are a few decisions and steps that you should take to set up how the marketing area manages certain aspects of your contacts. For example, you can decide whether to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, vendor card, and bank account card, how number series are defined, or what the standard salutation should be when writing to your contacts.

Managing your contacts and having a strategy in place to identify, attract, and retain customers will help optimize your business and increase customer satisfaction. Using a good contact management system will also help you create and maintain relationships with your customers. Communication is the key to these relationships. Being able to tailor communication with potential and existing customers, vendors, and business partners according to their needs, is necessary for companies to succeed. Establishing a strategy and defining how your company uses contact information is a primary step. This information will be viewed by many different groups in your company, so having a good system in place will help everyone be more productive.

You set up the marketing and contact management from the **Marketing Setup** page. To open the **Marketing Setup** page, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Marketing Setup**, and then choose the related link.

## Automatically Copying Specific Information from Contact Companies to Contact Persons
Some information about contact companies is identical to the information about the contact persons working within these companies, for example, the address details. In the **Inheritance** section of the **Marketing Setup** page, you can set the application to automatically copy specific fields from the contact company card to the contact person card each time you create a contact person for a contact company. For example, you can select to copy the salesperson code, address details (address, address 2, city, post code, and county), communication details (fax number, telex answer back, and phone number), and more.

When you modify one of these fields on the contact company card, application will automatically modify the field on the contact person card (unless you have manually modified the field on the contact person card).

For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use Predefined Defaults on New Contacts
You can decide that the application automatically assigns a specific language code, territory code, salesperson code, and country/region code as defaults to each new contact you create. You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The inheritance of fields overwrites the default values you have set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, application will automatically assign German as the language code for the contact persons recorded for that company.

<!--You can also setup a default salutation that application automatically assigns to your contacts. You can use these salutations in your interaction template attachments (for example, Microsoft Word documents). When setting up a default salutation, you can enter a salutation text and a salutation format. For example, if the salutation text is Dear, and the salutation format is Salutation Text + Title + Name, application will automatically enter Dear Mr. John Smith as a salutation for a contact called John Smith.-->

## Automatically Recording Interactions
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically record sales and purchase documents as interactions (for example, orders, invoices, receipts, and so on), as well as emails, phone calls, and cover sheets.

For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## Synchronizing Contacts with Customers and More
In order to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, the vendor card and the bank account card, you must select a business relation code for customers, vendors, and bank accounts. For example, you can only link a contact with an existing customer if you have selected a business relation code for customers on the **Marketing Setup** page.

For more information, see [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).  

## Assigning a Number Series to Contacts and Opportunities
You can set up a number series for contacts and opportunities. If you have set up a number series for contacts, when you create a contact, and select <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the No. field on the contact card, application automatically enters the next available contact number.

For more information about number series, see [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## Searching for Duplicate Contacts when Contacts are Created
You can choose to have application automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact company, or you can choose to search manually after you have created contacts. You can also choose to have application update the search strings automatically each time you modify contact information or create a contact. You can decide the search hit percentage, that is, the percentage of identical strings two contacts must have for application to consider them as duplicates.

# Design details: Item tracking and planning
Because they are stored in the reservation system, item tracking numbers are fully coordinated with order tracking records. This means that items with order tracking records can be assigned item tracking numbers. Conversely, items that have item tracking numbers can become order tracking records. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Design](design-details-item-tracking-design.md).

For more information about the integrated systems, see [Design Details: Reservations, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

Because order tracking is only concerned with specific item application, the coordination with item tracking numbers only applies to items that are set up to use specific item tracking. This is set by the **SN Specific Tracking** and **Lot Specific Tracking** fields on the item card, which specify the following:

- The item must carry a serial number or lot number when it is posted.
- The item must apply to the same serial number or lot number when it is posted outbound.

In alignment with standard supply/demand balancing principles, the planning system and the related order tracking feature only match supply and demand carrying item tracking numbers if the item in question uses specific item tracking. In all other cases, the planning and order tracking systems ignore item tracking numbers when they apply supply to meet demand or apply demand to supply. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

For example, when order tracking exists for a given item, it implies that records for the item are already in the **Reservation Entry** table, which is the core of the reservation system, before the item tracking numbers are defined. Therefore, the following coupling restrictions apply to the item tracking numbers to be order tracked:

- Demand with a serial number or lot number can only cover supply with the same serial number or lot number.
- Demand without a serial or lot number can cover any supply, with or without a serial or lot number.

Apart from their consequences on dynamic order tracking, the item tracking coupling restrictions do not affect the planning system significantly.

On the supply side, a serial or lot number is typically not entered until immediately before the order is posted, such as a purchase receipt into the warehouse. When entering a serial or lot number on the demand side, such as on a sales order, that serial or lot number is already in inventory. Accordingly, item tracking numbers are typically not an issue in supply planning.

For items that use specific item tracking, all demand carrying serial or lot numbers must be matched by corresponding supply. In most cases, it does not make sense to reorder a specific serial or lot number, so the planning of purchase or production supplies is probably not affected. However, when transferring items from one location to another, it is likely that the transfer is for a specific lot, so planning transfer supplies might be affected by the specific coupling restriction.

For more information, see [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).

## Balancing demand and supply
If an item requires specific item tracking, then an order tracking link is made from all the item’s item tracking demand to any corresponding item tracking supply, with the sole limitation that supply should come before demand. If, under those circumstances, no item tracking supply can be found that corresponds to the item tracking-specific demand, then a new item tracking supply is created immediately and without considering order sizing, planning parameters, or rescheduling of existing supply of the same serial or lot number.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the demand side or on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then an order track link is made from the demand to that supply, based on the most suitable timing and quantity, as in the usual balancing procedure. The specified item tracking number goes into the order tracking record in the same way that any specified item tracking quantity defines one end of the order tracking link. This means that the item tracking number that is entered is preserved while it is also part of the order tracking record.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then this supply is regarded as fixed by the planning system. No resizing or rescheduling is suggested for this supply, but the supply is taken into consideration when the planning system tries to meet the gross requirements.

For more information, see [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).

# The Company Hub for Business Central Extension

This application provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that the user has access to across all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, such as the many clients of an accountant. The home page displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the individual environments and companies so that users can.

The dashboard is a highly specialized Role Center for a better overview of your work.

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.

## Installing the extension

When you install the extension in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you will be asked if you want to use it now. If you do, then you must sign out and sign in again, because the extension replaces your current Role Center and adds permissions to your user profile.

# Configuring OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="url"></a>Get your OneDrive URL

[!INCLUDE[onedrive-url](includes/onedrive-url.md)]

## Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Run OneDrive setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Microsoft Entra ID registered app, the **Set Up Microsoft Entra ID** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. Learn more in [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it enables you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration 

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup leads you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Microsoft Entra app for authentication. The Microsoft Entra app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup changes your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Microsoft Entra app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already a Microsoft app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it compares the app configured in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, the Microsoft Entra app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration changes to use the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text: 

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.**

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to.

  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. Learn more in the section [Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee).**

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup copies app configuration to the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, so it's used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations.**

### Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.

# Close accounting periods

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it.

## To close accounting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Year** action.

    If more than one fiscal year is open, the earliest one is automatically selected to be closed. A message identifies the year that will close and the results of its closing.
3. To close the year, choose the **Yes** button.

The fiscal year is closed, and the **Closed** and **Date Locked** fields for all the periods in the year are selected. The fiscal year can't be opened again and you can't remove the check mark from the **Closed** or **Date Locked** fields.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't close a fiscal year before you create a new one. Notice that after a fiscal year is closed, you can't change the starting date of the following fiscal year.

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior-Year Entry** field is selected.

After a fiscal year is closed, you must close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. You can repeat this every time that you post to the closed fiscal year.

# Work with payment tolerances and payment discount tolerances

You can set up a payment tolerance to close an invoice when the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, payment tolerances are typically for small amounts that would cost more to correct than to just accept. You can set up a payment discount tolerance to grant a payment discount after the payment discount date.  

Use payment tolerances so that every outstanding amount has a set maximum allowed payment tolerance. If the payment tolerance is met, the payment amount is analyzed. If the payment amount is an underpayment, the underpayment fully closes the outstanding amount. A detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the applied invoice entry. If the payment amount is an overpayment, then a new detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the payment entry.

You can set up payment discount tolerances so that if you accept a discount after the payment discount date, it always posts to a payment discount or payment tolerance account.

## Applying payment tolerance to multiple documents

A single document has the same payment tolerance, regardless of whether you apply it on its own or with other documents. Acceptance of a late payment discount when you're applying payment tolerance to multiple documents automatically occurs for each document where the following rule is true:  

*payment discount date < payment date on the selected entry <= payment tolerance date*  

This rule also determines whether to display warnings when you apply payment tolerance to multiple documents. The payment discount tolerance warning displays for each entry that meets the date criteria. For more information, see [Example 2 - Tolerance Calculations for Multiple Documents](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#example-2---tolerance-calculations-for-multiple-documents).

You can choose to display a warning that is based on different tolerance situations.  

- The first warning is for the payment discount tolerance. You're informed that you can accept a late payment discount. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the discount date.  
- The second warning is for the payment tolerance. You're informed that all entries can be closed because the difference is in the sum of the maximum payment tolerance for the applied entries. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the payment amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling the warning message will let choose how to process payments that are within tolerance. If you do not enable the message, and a tolerance level is specified, invoices with amounts that are within tolerance will be automatically closed and you cannot choose to leave the remaining amount. 

For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings). 

## To set up tolerances

Tolerance on days and amounts allows you to close an invoice even though the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, because the due date for the payment discount has past, goods were deducted, or because of a minor error. This principle also applies to refunds and credit memos.  

To set up tolerance you have to set up various tolerance accounts, specify both payment discount tolerance and payment tolerance posting methods and then run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job.  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, set up a debit and a credit sales payment tolerance account and a debit and a credit purchase payment tolerance account.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.    
4. On the **Customer Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account. For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Vendor Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account.  
7. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
8. Open the **General Ledger Setup** page.  
9. On the **Application** FastTab, fill in the **Payment Disc. Tolerance Posting**, **Payment Discount Grace Period** and **Payment Tolerance Posting** fields.   
10. Choose the **Change Payment Tolerance** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you choose **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on a **Customer Card** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not automatically post payment tolerances, even when they're within the thresholds set on the **General Ledger Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that  the Apply to Oldest setting indicates that the customer (or you as a customer of your vendor) has an account with you where they regularly pay the balance. Therefore, remaining amounts shouldn't be removed by posting a payment tolerance entry.

11. On the **Change Payment Tolerance** page, fill in the **Payment Tolerance %** and **Max Pmt. Tolerance Amount** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have now set up tolerance for local currency only. If you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle tolerance on payments, credit memos, and refunds in a foreign currency, you must run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job with a value in the **Currency Code** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To get a payment tolerance warning every time that you post an application in the tolerance, you must activate the payment tolerance warning. For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings) section.  
>
> To deactivate tolerance for a customer or vendor, block tolerances on the relevant customer or vendor card. For more information, see [To block payment tolerance for customers](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-block-payment-tolerance-for-customers).  
>
> When you set up tolerance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also checks if there are any open entries and calculates the tolerance for these entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you enable the **Adjust for Payment Discount** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, the VAT amount is considered as it relates to the **Payment Tolerances** and **Payment Discounts** amounts, and VAT will be reduced for both of transaction amounts if they exist. The system can't be configured to use VAT reducing only for one type of transaction.  

## To enable or disable payment tolerance warnings

The payment tolerance warning appears when you post an application that has a balance in the allowed tolerance. You can then choose how you want to post and document the balance.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **Application** FastTab, turn on the **Payment Tolerance Warning** toggle to activate the warning. To deactivate the warning, turn off the toggle.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default option for the **Payment Tolerance Warning** page is **Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount**. The default option for the **Payment Discount Tolerance Warning** page the is **Do Not Accept the Late Payment Discount**.

## To block payment tolerance for customers

The default setting for payment tolerance is allowed. To disallow a certain customer or vendor payment tolerance, block the tolerance on the respective customer or vendor card. The following steps describe how to do it for a customer. The steps are similar for a vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payments** FastTab, select the **Block Payment Tolerance** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the customer or vendor has open entries, you must first remove payment tolerance from entries that are currently open.

## Example 1 - Tolerance calculations for a single document

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:

- Payment Discount Grace Period: 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance: 5  

Scenarios with alternative A or B represent:  

- **A** In this case, the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post the Balance as Payment Tolerance).  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount (Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount).

### Payment Range Diagrams

In relation to the scenario, the diagrams of payment ranges are as follows:  

#### (1) Payment Date <=01/15/03 (Scenarios 1-3)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 1.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Pre1503.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 1")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (2) Payment Date is between 01/16/03 and 01/20/03 (Scenarios 4-9)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 2.](media/singlePmtTolRules_GracePeriod.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 2")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (3) Payment Date is after 01/20/03 (Scenarios 10-15)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 3.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Post0120.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 3")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed even with tolerance.  

## Example 2 - Tolerance calculations for multiple documents

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations. The examples are limited to scenarios that result in all entries in the application being closed.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:
- Payment Discount Grace Period 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance 5  

Scenarios with alternative A, B, C, or D represent the following:  

- **A** In this case the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post as Tolerance) in any invoice.  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on any invoice.  
- **C** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but not the second.  
- **D** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but allowed it on the second.

# Work with responsibility centers

Responsibility centers provide the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. For example, companies can set up user-specific views of sales and purchase documents related to a particular responsibility center.  

Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in flexible, optimal ways.

Multiple locations allow companies to manage their inventory in multiple locations using one database. Two concepts, locations and stockkeeping units, are the cornerstones of this granule. A location is defined as a place that handles physical placement and quantities of items. The concept is broad enough to include locations such as plants or production facilities and distribution centers, warehouses, showrooms, and service vehicles. A stockkeeping unit is defined as an item at a specific location and/or as a variant. Using stockkeeping units, companies with multiple locations can add replenishment information, addresses, and some financial posting information at the location level. As a result, they can replenish variants of the same item for each location and order items based on location-specific replenishment information.  

## To set up a responsibility center

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If you're using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
5. On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field, enter a responsibility center code.

This code is used on all purchase, sales, or service documents, if the user, customer, or vendor has no default responsibility center. On sales, purchase, or service documents, you can enter another responsibility center than the default.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.  

## To assign responsibility centers to users

You can set up users so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  

To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas: Purchases, Sales, and Service Management.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **User Setup** page, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
3. In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to sales.  
4. In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to purchasing.  
5. In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to service management.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users can view only those posted documents that related to their own responsibility center. However, they can view all ledger entries and navigate to other posted documents from the ledger entries.

# Set up an additional reporting currency

As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they're able to review and report financial data in more than one currency.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if you're looking for real time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates, it's referred to as currency. In addition to this article, see also [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. If you designate a second currency as an additional reporting currency (ACY), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and ACY on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries.

> [!Warning]
> You shouldn't use the ACY feature as a basis for financial statement translation unless you understand its limitations. It can't translate foreign subsidiary financial statements as part of a company consolidation. The ACY can only be used to prepare reports in another currency, as if that currency was the company's LCY.
>
> For example, you have a large amount of accounts receivable in British pounds (GBP), and you have set up your ACY to be GBP. In this scenario, amounts in the accounts receivable that use GBP aren't adjusted for currency exchange gains/losses in the ACY, only amounts in the accounts receivable that are in other currencies. That means that if you use ACY to report your financial statements, it might result in understated or overstated outstanding balances of accounts receivable.

## Displaying reports and amounts in ACY

Using an ACY can assist the reporting process for a company in the following cases:

- Companies in non-EU countries/regions that have a high proportion of transactions with EU country/region companies. In this case, the non-EU company might also want to report in euro to make its financial reports more usable for EU trade partners.
- Companies that also wish to display reports in a more internationally traded currency than their own local currency.

Several financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the ACY, select the **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox on the **Options** FastTab for the relevant G/L report.

## Adjusting exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, ACY equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments aren't done, amounts that converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY can be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into application must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job is used to adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. It can also update ACY amounts on G/L entries. For more information, see [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

## Setting up an ACY

To set up an ACY, follow these steps:

- Specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries.  
- Activate the ACY.  

### To specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, fill in the following fields for the ACY.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Realized GL Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate gains for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Realized GL Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate losses for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Residual Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are gains are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|  
|**Residual Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are losses are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Residual amounts can occur when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] rounds debit and credit amounts that have been converted from LCY to an ACY.  

For each general ledger account, you must specify how general ledger amounts for that account are adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

### To specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **GL Account Card** page, select the relevant method in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  

    If you post in an ACY, in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field, specify how this general ledger account is adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Select this option if the exchange rate between the LCY and ACY is always fixed.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

    Exchange rate gains and losses are posted when you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. In that batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the general ledger entry are compared to determine whether there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field to determine how to calculate and post exchange rate gains or losses for general ledger accounts.  

4.  Close the **G/L Account Card** page.  

### To specify exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the relevant method in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  
3. If you post in an ACY, in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field you can specify how the accounts set up for VAT posting on the **VAT Posting Setup** page are adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

    When you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rate** page and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the VAT entry are compared to determine if there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in this field to determine how to post exchange rate gains or losses for VAT accounts.  

    You have the same options as with general ledger entries but in this case the entries adjusted are the VAT entries. The following table describes the options.

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

### To activate the ACY  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Additional Reporting Currency** field, choose the additional currency that you want to report in.  
3. When you leave the field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a confirmation message describing the effects of activating the ACY.  
4. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to activate the currency.  
5. The **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job opens.

    This batch job converts LCY amounts on existing entries to the ACY. The batch job uses a default exchange rate copied from the exchange rate that is valid on the work date on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. Residual amounts that occur on conversion of LCY to ACY are posted to the residual gains and losses accounts specified on the **Currencies** page. The posting date and document number for these entries are the same as for the original general ledger entry. After you post all residual entries, the batch job posts a rounding entry on the closing date of each closed year to the retained earnings account. This posting makes sure that the ending balance of the income accounts for each closed year is 0 in both LCY and the ACY.
6. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]      
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.  

After you run the batch job, amounts on the following existing entries are in both the LCY and ACY:  

- General ledger entries  
- Item application entries  
- VAT entries  
- Project ledger entries  
- Value entries  
- Production order lines  
- Production order ledger entries  

In addition, all future entries of the same type have amounts recorded in both LCY and the ACY.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Add. Reporting Currency** field will only be activated after you choose the **OK** button in the **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, may have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Get the Business Central add-in for Outlook

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in [!INCLUDE [outlook-name](includes/outlook-name.md)]. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] add-in, you can view financial data related to customers and vendors. You can also create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

There are two ways to get the Business Central add-in for Outlook installed, depending on your role in the organization:

- As a Microsoft 365 administrator, use *Centralized Deployment* to install the add-in automatically for the entire organization, groups, or specific users.

- As any user, install the add-in for your own use if not already done by your admin.

## About the Business Central add-in for Outlook

The Business Central add-in for Outlook consists of two smaller add-ins:

- Contact insights

    This add-in provides users with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also enables you to create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such sales quotes and invoices to a contact. <!--To support these task, the add-in adds actions to the Outlook ribbon, in the **Business Central** group. --> 

- Document view

    When an email refers to a business document number in the email body, this add-in provides a direct, in-line link from email body to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For more information about what you do with the add-ins, see [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

Each add-in is provided as an XML file, called a *manifest*, which must be installed in Outlook of anyone who wants this functionality. These files describe how to activate the add-ins and connect to Business Central when they're used in Outlook. Working with these files is typically done by an admin. As a user, in most cases, you won't have to handle with these files directly. Either your admin will set up the add-in to install automatically for you or you'll use the built-in assisted setup to handle the installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Working with multiple environments? The Business Central add-in for Outlook is designed to work with a single Business Central environment. When the add-in is installed, the name of the environment is included in the add-in's manifest. This configuration means that the add-in will only connect to the environment that it was installed from. To use the add-in with a different environment, you'll open the environment and install the add-in again.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment as an admin

Centralized Deployment is a feature in Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Outlook. It's the recommended way for admins to deploy for Office add-ins to users and groups within your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For Business Central on-premises, see [Setting Up the Add-In for Outlook Integration with Business Central On-Premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/setting-up-office-add-ins-outlook-inbox) in the administration content (English only).

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 subscription  
- Users are assigned a Microsoft 365 license  
- Your Microsoft 365 account has at least the [Exchange Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#exchange-administrator) role

### Deploy the add-in

1. In Business Central, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link.
1. Select **Outlook Add-in Centralized Deployment** to start the assisted setup guide.
1. Review the first page and select **Next** to open the page for downloading the add-ins.
1. In the **Deploy** column, select the check box for the add-ins that you want to deploy, then select **Download and Continue**.

    A file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device.

1. At this point, you're finished with the work you need to do in Business Central, so you can select **Done**.

   >[!TIP]
   > Before you select **Next**, select the **Go to Microsoft 365 (opens in a new window)** link to open and sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a new browser window. You'll have to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a later step anyways.

1. Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** files from the .zip to a folder of your choice.

    For more information, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, then go to [Integrated Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967).

1. Select **Upload custom apps**.
1. On the **Upload Apps to deploy** page, set **App type** to **Office Add-in**.
1. Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device** > **Choose file**.
1. Choose one of the add-in files **Context Insights.xml** or **Documents.xml** that you extracted earlier.
1. Follow the instructions to assign users and deploy the add-in.
1. Repeat step 9 through 11 for the other add-in file if you want.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A green check mark appears when the add-in is deployed to the admin center. However, it can take up to 24 hours before users see the add-in in the [!INCLUDE [outlook-name-short](includes/outlook-name-short.md)] app. Users might have to restart Outlook as well.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-do-you-target-add-in-user-assignments-with-centralized-deployment-&preserve-view=true).

## <a name="install"></a>Install the add-in for your own use

If your organization allows it, you can install the Business Central add-in for just yourself. Contact your administrator if you're not sure.

1. In Business Central, go to the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Get the Outlook Add-in**, and then select the related link.
2. Read the page and select **Next** when ready.
3. If you want to receive a welcome email message from Business Central with overview of using the add-in, turn on **Send sample email message**.

### <a name="onprem"></a>For Business Central on-premises

If you're using Business Central on-premises, installing the add-in might be slightly different.

1. In Business Central, go to the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Get the Outlook Add-in**, then select the related link.
1. Read the page and select **Next** when ready.
1. Do one of the following steps, depending on the page you see:

    - If you see the **Install to my Outlook** button, select it and you're all done.
    - If you see the **Next** button, select it. On the next page, if you want to receive a welcome email message from Business Central with overview of using the add-in, turn on **Send sample email message**. Then, select **Finish** and you're all done.
    - If you see the **Download Add-in** button, select it, then continue to the next step.
1. When you select **Download Add-in**, a file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device. You should find the file at the top of the browser.

   Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** file from the .zip to a folder of your choice. For more information about how to extract files, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).

# Create bins

The most effective way to create the bins of your warehouse is to generate groups of similar bins in the bin creation worksheet, but you can also create your bins individually from the location card. You can also use a function on the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page to create bins automatically.  

## To create a bin from the location card

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### The dedicated field

The **Dedicated** field on the **Bins** page specifies that quantities in the bin are protected from being picked for other demands. However, quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

Making a bin dedicated results in similar functionality in basic warehousing to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

### Example

A work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code.

> [!Caution]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production or assembly components with the **Inventory Pick** page. For more information, see [Pick for Production or Assembly in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

## To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you're creating.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bins** action.  

## To make bins automatically in the bin creation worksheet

Before you start creating bins automatically, you should determine the kind of bins that are essential for your operations, and the most practical flow of items through the physical structure of your warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As soon as you use a bin, you cannot delete it unless it is empty. But if you want to use another bin-naming system, you can use the reclassification journal to in effect move your items to a new bin system. This process is manual and takes time, however, so it is best to set up your bins correctly from the start.  

To work with the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page, you must be set up as a warehouse employee at the location where the bins exist. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).    

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Bins** action.
3. On the **Calculate Bins** page, in the **Bin Template Code** field, select the bin template that you want to use as the model for the bins you're creating.
4.  Fill in a description for the bins you are in the process of creating.  
5.  To create the bin codes, fill in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields in the three categories shown on the page: **Rack**, **Section,**, and **Level.** The bin code can contain up to 20 characters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The number of characters that you have entered in the three categories for either field, for example, the characters you have entered in the three **From No.** fields, plus the field separators, if any, must be 20 or less.  

     You can use letters in the code as an identifying combination, but the letter you use must be the same in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields. For example, you might define the Rack part of the code as **From No. A01** and **To No. A10**. The application isn't set up to generate codes with letter sequences, for example, from A01 to F05.  

6.  If you want a character, such as a hyphen, to separate the category fields you have defined as part of the bin code, fill in the **Field Separator** field with this character.  
7.  If you want application not to create a line for a bin if it exists already, select the **Check on Existing Bin** field.  
8. When you finish filling in the fields, choose the **OK** button.

    The application creates a line for each bin in the worksheet. You can now delete some of the bins, for example, if you have a rack with a passageway through the first two levels of a couple of sections.  

9. When you delete all unnecessary bins, choose the **Create Bins** action, and application creates bins for each line in the worksheet.  

Repeat the process for another set of bins until you create all the bins in your warehouse.

# The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension

This extension is included in the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide to help you migrate important business data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when your business is growing, and you've decided to upgrade your business management app by starting to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What data can I import from QuickBooks Online?

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Customers
* Vendors
* Items
* Chart of accounts
* Beginning balance transaction in the general ledger
* On-hand quantities for inventory items
* Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos, and payments

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:  

* The sale of items or services to customers.
* The purchase of items or services from vendors.  
* Adjustments in the general ledger.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks Online.

If transactions in QuickBooks Online have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you can post transactions.

## How do I start using the extension?

Getting started is easy. All you need to do is run the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide. Here's how:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Migrate business data**.
2. Follow the instructions on each step in the assisted setup guide.

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status **Unposted**, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the **Sales Invoices** page. To review payment journals, go to the **Payment Journals** page.  

There are a few things in particular that you should do:

* If the transactions in QuickBooks Online had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you post them.
* If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
* Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks Online does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Responsible AI FAQ for summarize (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s summarize feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is summarize?

Business Central users often need an overview of their data and what urgently needs their attention to decide how to proceed with their tasks optimally.

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to generate an insightful summary of any record, making it effortless for people to learn what is important or urgent.

## What are the capabilities of summarize?

- A concise summary is displayed as a FactBox on most card and document pages in Business Central. It typically provides the top two or three insightful points as brief sentences.

- From the initial summary, users can select **Show more** to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens and generates additional points of interest.

- When any summary is displayed, Copilot makes it easy to review and learn about the facts referenced by the summary. These references are hyperlinked, so that users can quickly view or navigate to the source where they can explore details and take action.

While the summary text is AI-generated, each insight is grounded in factual data from Business Central. Copilot inherits the user's data permissions and can’t read any more data than the user already has access to.

## What is the intended use of summarize?

This feature helps people understand their business data, reduces the time it takes to sift through Business Central’s rich dataset, and makes Business Central easier to use. It isn't designed to make decisions on your behalf, provide recommendations, or advise on how to act or optimize your business.

Summaries don't automatically trigger actions on behalf of the user or the organization, and they don't persist to the database for other automated functions to use.

## How was Summarize evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data supplemented with extra, fictitious business data and volume data. Testing primarily covered various fields and pages from Business Central’s base application, with some testing also carried out on custom pages and fields. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of ranked insights, use of language, grounding of values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various automated systems to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content.

Microsoft might turn off Copilot features for specific customers if abuse is detected.
 
Users can provide feedback on every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback and use it to improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons that are displayed alongside generated content.

## What are the AI limitations of Summarize? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment
to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot because of the sensitive nature of that domain.

- Summaries about people

  Summaries about people, such as customers, vendors, or employees in Business Central, might result in limited output from Copilot because of other safety mechanisms designed to reduce the risk of inaccuracies. Even though Copilot isn't designed to provide recommendations or conclusions about people, you should use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions.

## What data does Summarize collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to provide the service.

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your interactions with the feature. It doesn't collect summary texts or other company data used or collected by  Copilot to generate summaries.

- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Block vendors

You can block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor on purchase documents or post payments to the vendor.

The following table describes the options for blocking vendors.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
|**Payment**|New payments can't be created for this vendor.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this vendor.|  

## To block a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the vendor that you want to block.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose one of the options for blocking.

## Handling vendor payment disputes

You can out vendor ledger entries **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document.

To learn more, go to [Handling vendor payment disputes](payables-how-handling-payment-disputes.md).

# Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs

When running reports, users are typically presented with a page that lets them select options and set filters to change the data that is included in the generated report. This page is called the *request page*. A report can include one or more *saved settings* that users can apply to the report from the request page. *Saved settings* are basically predefined options and filters. Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. For more information, see [Use saved settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to *reports*, but similar information applies to *batch jobs*.

If you have the proper permissions, you can view, create, and modify the saved settings for all reports for all users in a company. You can assign saved settings for a report to individual users or to all users in the company.

## Manage saved settings

You manage saved settings on the **Reports Settings** page. There are two ways to open this page:

- Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Settings**, and then choose the related link.
- In a report's request page, choose the lookup in the **Use default values from** field, and then choose the **Select from full list** action.

    This field is only visible if you have run the report at least once earlier. The list will only show settings that are available to you, either because they are your own settings, or because the settings are shared with you.

The **Report Settings** page displays all the existing saved settings entries for all users. If there is a user name in the **Assigned to** field, only that user can use the saved settings for the associated report. If there is a check mark in the **Share with all users** field, all users can use the saved settings for the report.  

> [!TIP]
> When a user has run a report that supports shared settings, their settings are saved and added to this list. In most cases, the admin can then edit those settings and choose to share the settings with all users.
>
> However, in some cases, settings cannot be shared, and the admin cannot change them either. Most batch jobs do not support shared settings.  

## Create or modify saved settings for all users

From the **Report Settings** page, you can:

- Choose the **New** action to create a new saved settings entry from scratch.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Copy** action to create a copy.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Edit** action to modify a saved settings entry.

> [!Important]
> Consider the name that you give a saved settings entry. If you create a saved settings entry for all users, and you give it the same name as an existing saved settings entry that is assigned to a specific user only, then that user will not be able to use the saved settings entry that is assigned to everyone.  In the **Saved Settings** section on the request page, the user will see two saved settings entries with the same name. However, no matter which option they choose, the user-specific saved settings entry will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to save settings is available only on reports where the [SaveValues property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-savevalues-property) of the report's request page is set to **Yes**. The **SaveValues** property is set by the developer.

# Collect outstanding balances

This article describes features that can help you collect outstanding balances from your customers.

When customer payments are registered and reconciled, the collections process often involves one or more of the following steps to collect outstanding balances. Depending on the way you handle collections in your business, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you:

- Send statements to inform customers about their balances, overdue balances, and the relevant transactions. For example, either open entries or all entries posted in last year/quarter/month or other period. If customers have overdue payments, you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder. To learn more, go to [Statements](#statements).
- Send reminders (also known as *dunning letters* or *payment requests*) to customers to inform them of overdue balances. The reminder can include both overdue and open entries, so the customer is also aware of upcoming due dates. You can also use reminders to calculate finance charges, such as interest or fees and include them on the reminder. You can automate the processes for creating, issuing, and posting reminders. To learn more, go to [Reminders](#reminders).  
- Send finance charge memos to claim interest fees for overdue amounts. Use finance charge memos if you want to debit customers for interest or fees without reminding them of overdue amounts. To learn more, go to [Finance Charges](#finance-charges).
- Communicate with customers over the phone or by e-mail regarding overdue balances and manage potential misunderstandings and disputes, or simply to remind customers to balance their accounts in a more direct manner. To learn more, go to [Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work](#use-copilot-for-finance-in-outlook-to-streamline-manual-collections-work).

## Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot for Finance is currently in preview and available in the United States. It's planned to become generally available in the second half of 2024, at which point pricing information is expected to be published.

When you're communicating with customers via e-mail about outstanding balances, chances are you need to look up customer and invoice related information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot for Finance makes this task easier by ensuring that relevant customer data is on hand in Outlook. For example, for an email you received, Copilot for Finance can find the customer through the linked contact and display aged balance information and list outstanding invoices that you can easily attach to a reply. Copilot for Finance in Outlook also lets you:

- Access and update the **Dispute Status** and **Promise to Pay** date on invoices
- Update contact information
- Draft e-mail replies with Copilot
- Attach a statement and invoices directly from Outlook.

To learn more, go to [Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-for-finance) and [Deployment Guide for Copilot for Finance (preview)](/copilot/finance/get-started/deployment-guide).

## Statements

From the customer card, you can create a statement for customer's transactions with you. Then, you can generate a PDF file and send it to the customer. Alternatively, use the **Customer Statement** report to send your customers an overview of their business with you.

> [!TIP]
> If needed, you can send the statement to Excel to make changes.  

### To send the Customer Statement report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Statement**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Under **Output Options**, select how to send the report to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using multiple currencies, the Customer Statement report is always printed in the customer's currency. The last date in a statement period is also used as the statement date and the aging date, if aging is included.

## Reminders

[!INCLUDE [receivables-reminders](includes/receivables-reminders.md)]

## Finance charges

When a customer doesn't pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments. Alternatively, you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders.  

Before you can create finance charge memos, you must set up terms. For more information, see [Set Up Finance Charge Terms](finance-setup-finance-charges.md).  

You can manually create a finance charge memo for an individual customer, and fill in the lines automatically. Alternatively, you can use the **Create Finance Charge Memos** action to create finance charge memos for all or selected customers with overdue balances.  

After you create the finance charge memos, you can modify them. The text that appears at the beginning and end of the finance charge memo is determined by the finance charge terms, and can be seen in the **Description** column on the lines. If a calculated amount is added automatically in the beginning or ending text, the text won't be adjusted if you delete lines. Then you must use the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.  

After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos, typically as email.

### To create a finance charge memo manually

A finance charge memo is similar to an invoice. You can fill in a header manually and have the lines filled in for you, or you can create finance charge memos for all customers automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose **Suggest Fin. Charge Memo Lines** action.
4. On the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** page, set a filter on the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create finance charge memos only for specific entries.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although they're listed, selecting **Payment** and **Credit Memo** as **Document Type** filters won't have an effect because the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** action only handles positive amounts.
5. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.  

### To update finance charge memo texts

In some cases, you might want to modify the beginning and ending text for the finance charge terms. If you do this at a time when you have created, but not yet issued, finance charge memos, you can update the memos with the modified text.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memo**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the finance charge memo that you want to change text for, and then choose the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.
3. On the **Update Finance Charge Text** page, you can set a filter if you want to update several memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button to update the beginning and ending texts.  

### To issue finance charge memos

After you create finance charge memos and make any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos.

When you issue a reminder, the entries post according to your specifications on the **Finance Charge Terms** page. This specification determines whether interest and/or additional fees post to the customer's account and the general ledger. Settings on the **Customer Posting Groups** page determine the accounts that interest or fees post to.

For each customer ledger entry on the finance charge memo, an entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page.

If the **Post Interest** or the **Post Additional Fee** checkboxes are selected on the **Finance Charge Terms** page, the following entries are also created:

- One entry on the **Cust. Ledger Entries** page
- One receivables entry in the relevant G/L account
- One interest and/or one additional fee entry in the relevant G/L account

Also, issuing the finance charge memo might result in VAT entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant memo, and then choose the **Issue** action.
3. On the **Issue Finance Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The finance charge memo is either printed for sent to a specified email as a PDF attachment.

### To cancel an issued finance charge memo

If finance charge memos were issued in error, you can cancel them before they're sent out. You can do this either one by one or as a batch.

1. On the **Issued Finance Charge Memos** page, select one or more lines for issued finance charge memos that you want to cancel, and then choose the **Cancel** action.
2. On the **Cancel Issued Fin. Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

### To view reminder and finance charge entries  

When you issue a reminder, a reminder entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page for each reminder line that contains a customer ledger entry. You can then get an overview of the created reminder entries for a specific customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant customer card, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the line with the ledger entry you want to see the reminder entries for, and then choose the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** action.

# Exchanging Data Electronically
You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners.

In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Data Exchange Framework is used in processes such as exchanging electronic documents, importing and exporting bank files, and updating exchange rates for currencies. For more information, see [About the Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md).

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by specifying the data to exchange, and how to exchange it. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

# Setting Up Source Codes and Reason Codes for Audit Trails

All posted entries are automatically assigned a source code so that transactions can be traced to their origin. If you want to give entries a supplementary source code, you can use reason codes. Reason codes are used to indicate why an entry was created. When you set up reason codes, you can assign them to entire journal templates and journal batches, and you can assign them to individual journal lines and documents.  

For both source codes and reason codes, use codes that are easy to remember and descriptive. The code must be unique, and you can set up as many codes as you like.

## Define source codes

Sometimes, you want see how a particular entry arose, such as whether it came from posting a general journal or a purchase invoice. A source code indicates where an entry was created. Entries are created when journals and invoices are posted and when certain batch jobs are executed. Each posting type has a specific source code that is assigned when individual entries are created.  

Posting journals, orders, invoices, or credit memos, and running various batch jobs, creates entries in the financial statements. The **Source Code Setup** page contains several FastTabs, one for each application area. Each FastTab contains the source codes that are applicable for that application area.

When you post or run a batch job, the correct source code is automatically attached to the entry. For example, when you post from the general journal, the entry is coded as *GENJNL*. You can then filter the **General Ledger Entries** page to show which entries were posted from the general journal or from sales documents, for example

### To define source codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Source Code Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

2. In the **Source Code Setup** window, for each each posting type and batch job, specify the relevant source code.  

You can change the contents of a field later, and that change will then impact future postings.

## Change source codes

You may want to change a source code. For example, you want to change the source code *GENJNL* to *GNJ*.

### To change source codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Source Codes**, and then choose the related link.

2. On the line with the code to be changed, select the code in the **Code** field.

3. Enter the new code, and then choose the **Yes** button. You can also change the contents of the **Description** field.

All new entries that are posted from the general journal will have the new source code.

## Define reason codes

Reason codes supplement the source codes and are used to indicate why an entry was created. You can assign reason codes on individual entries, and you can assign permanent codes to specific journal templates and journal batches. When a reason code is linked to a journal line or a sales or purchase header, all entries are marked with the reason code when they are posted.  

### To set up reason codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon")  icon, enter **Reason Codes**, and then choose the related link.

2. In the **Reason Codes** window, enter the first code in the **Code** field. In the **Description** field, enter an explanatory text.

Repeat the procedure for each code you want to use. You can set up any number of codes.

The following procedure describes how to add a reason code to a journal template, but similar steps apply to adding a reason code to a journal line or journal batch.  

### To assign reason codes to journal templates

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon")  icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.

2. On the line with the selected journal template, in the **Reason Code** field, specify the relevant code.

3. Close the journal template.

The selected reason code will be copied to new journal batches created under this journal template. You assign reason codes to journal templates in the other application areas in the same way.

### To use reason codes on sales and purchase documents

1. Open the relevant sales or purchase document.

2. On the sales or purchase header, enter the code in the **Reason Code** field.

When the invoice is posted, the reason code is copied to each general ledger, customer, and vendor entry. You cannot assign different reason codes to the individual purchase and sales lines because all lines are posted as one entry.

# Set up e-documents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The E-Documents core module is a framework. By default, there's no **Service Integration** field. If you find the **Document Format** options by default, remember that they're offered as examples. Localization apps must provide format detail because they're specific to local requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> A standard PEPPOL document format is a global format in the **Document Format** field. Keep in mind that you probably can't use this format as is. It's a W1 format that Microsoft provides to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use this format.

The first step to configure electronic documents (e-documents) is to set up the E-Documents Service for e-document communication.

## Set up an e-document service

To set up an e-document service, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **E-Document Service** page, on the **General** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Code | Select the electronic export setup code. |
    | Description | Enter a brief description of the electronic export setup. |
    | Document Format | The export format of the electronic export setup. By default, there are two options in this field. You can select **PEPPOL BIS 3** as a generic code-based format or **Data Exchange** when you must set up predocuments of specific formats on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab.</p> |
    | Service Integration | Select the integration code for the electronic export setup. Currently, the only option is **No integration**. |

3. On the **Importing** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Automatic Import | Specify whether documents should be automatically imported from the service. |
    | Automatic processing| Specify whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses your e-document setup to automatically create a purchase document based on the received e-document. If you choose **No**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the e-document, but you must review its details before you create the purchase document. |
    | Validate Receiving Company | Specify whether the receiving company information must be validated during import. |
    | Resolve Unit Of Measure | Specify whether to resolve the unit of measure during import. |
    | Lookup Item Reference | Specify whether to search for items by item reference during import. |
    | Lookup Item GTIN | Specify whether to search for items by Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) during import. |
    | Lookup Account Mapping | Specify whether to search for accounts in **Account Mapping** by the incoming text during import. |
    | Validate Line Discount | Specify whether to validate a line discount during import. |
    | Apply Invoice Discount | Specify whether to apply an invoice discount during import. |
    | Verify Totals | Specify whether to verify invoice totals during import. |
    | Create Journal Lines | Specify whether a journal line must be created instead of a purchase document. Select this option when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Template Name | Specify the name of the general journal template that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Batch Name | Specify the name of the general journal batch that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | Batch Start Time | Specify the start time for import jobs. |
    | Minutes between runs | Specify the number of minutes between import job runs. |

4. If you selected **Data Exchange** in the **Document Format** field on the **General** FastTab, on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Document Type | Specify the document type that uses data exchange to import and export the data. Examples include **Sales Invoice**, **Sales Credit memo**, and **Purchase Invoice**. |
    | Import Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to import the data. Use this field only to receive a document in the purchase process. |
    | Export Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to export the data. Use this field only to deliver documents in the sales process. |

> [!NOTE]
> There are data exchange definitions for the PEPPOL format that are related to sales and purchase documents. However, you likely can't use these definitions as is. They're all W1 formats that are provided to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use them.
>
> If you configured the **Data Exchange Definition** format in your localization, you can add a line for the document types that you need. Add lines that match the default data exchange example for the W1 PEPPOL format. However, first select the **Document Type** option for each line that you need. For each data type, select the **Import Data Exchange Def. Code** or **Export Data Exchange Def. Code** value that you want to use.
>
> If you don't use the **Data Exchange Definition** format, you can create and configure formats by using the [interface](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extend-edocuments). Adjust the information on the **Export Mapping** and **Import Mapping** lines, where you can find the tables and fields to configure transformation rules. In this case, you must add a new option for your format in the **Document Format** field.  

5. On the **Exporting** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table:

   |Field  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   | Batch Exporting | Specify whether the service uses batch processing to export e-documents. |
   | Embed document PDF to export| Specify whether to embed a PDF version of the e-document in the e-document file when you export.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Embed document PDF to export** option can make life a little easier. When you post a document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a PDF file and embeds it as a PDF attachment in the e-document. The PDF is a human-readable version that's easier to understand than the full XML of the PEPPOL format.

### Supported document types

Support for document types is based on the **Document Format**. To check which document types are supported, on the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Supported Document Types** action. The **E-Document Service Supported Source Document Types** opens. In the **Source Document Type** column, you can choose different document types for the format you're planning to use. Only use the document type if that document is selected.

## Set up a document sending profile

You can set up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each customer. If you do, you don't have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you can set up sending profiles and then select the one to use in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** checkbox to specify that a document sending profile is the profile for all customers for which a profile isn't specified in the **Document Sending Profile** field.

This feature is used to set up electronic invoicing automation. When you choose **Post and Send** on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog shows the sending profile in use. It's either the profile set up for the customer or the default profile for all customers.

To set up a document sending profile, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Sending Profile**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the required fields.
4. On the **Sending Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Electronic Document | Specify whether the document is sent as an e-document that the customer can import into their system when you select **Post and Send**. To use this option, you must also set the **Format** or **Electronic Document Service Flow Code** field. Alternatively, you can save the file to your computer. |
    | Format | Specify the format to use to send an e-document. This field is required if you select **Through Document Exchange** in the **Electronic Document** field. |
    | Electronic Document Service Flow Code | Specify the electronic service flow that's used to send documents. This field is required if you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field, you must already have the workflow configured for your e-documents.

## Set up the workflow

To set up a workflow for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow Templates**, and then select the related link.
2. If you can't find **E-Document Workflow Templates** on the **Workflow Templates** page, select **Reset Microsoft Templates**. **E-Document Workflow Templates** should then appear. Close the page.
3. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, and then select the related link.
4. Choose the **New Workflow from Template** action to select a template for the e-documents process. The available templates are **Send to one service** and **Send to multiple services**.
5. Select **OK** to finish the workflow setup.
6. In the **Then Response** field, select **Send E-Document using setup** to configure the workflow responses.
7. Select the E-Document Service that you created as an option, choose **OK**, and then enable the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create your own workflow for e-documents without using predefined workflow templates. If you have more services, you can use different workflows.

To use more workflows, configure them through the document sending profiles for different customers. When you set up the workflow, specify the document sending profile in the **On Condition** column on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, because you can't have two services that use the same document sending profile in workflows.

When you configure your workflow on the **Workflows** page, point to the **On Condition** field on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab. On the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Filter** field, select the document sending profile that you want to use.

## Set up a retention policy for e-documents

E-documents can be subject to local legislation that specifies the period for which you must keep e-documents. To manage that, administrators can define retention policies that control how often [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes records. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

To set up retention policies for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Retention Policy** action.
2. When the action is completed, select one of the following retention policies to set up:

    - E-Document Log
    - E-Document Integration Log
    - E-Document Mapping Log
    - E-Document Data Storage

## E-Documents demo data  

> [!NOTE]
> From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 24.0, you can set up demo data for E-Documents.

To provide easier ways to test and demonstrate e-documents, Microsoft offers a demo module. To enable the module, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contoso Demo Tool**, and then select the related link.  
2. Before you enable the **E-Document Contoso Module**, you must first enable the  **Common Module** and **Warehouse Module**.
3. After you enable the modules, select the **E-Documents Contoso Module**, and then choose the **Generate** action.
4. Follow the steps.  
5. Close the page.

After you enable the module, you have demo items, six electronic documents (based on Peppol BIS 3), and configured **E-Document Services** with created workflows.

# Get the Business Central desktop app

If you have a Windows (PC) or macOS computer, you can install a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app on your desktop. The app works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises.

## Why use the app?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app resembles the web client, but it provides a few benefits like:

- The app is readily available from the **Start** menu, you can easily pin it to the task bar, or have it launch by default when you start your computer.
- In general, the app also is a faster and smoother to render on screen, with no performance differences, compared to running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the browser.
- The app opens in its own window, independent of any browser windows. This feature makes it easier to find when running a large number many apps or browser tabs.
- If there's more than one [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment (online only), you can install the app separately for each environment.

     When you open the app for specific environment, the environment name is included in the window title. When working across multiple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, each app window is displayed separately. The name makes it easier for you to see which window is associated with each environment.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

There are two ways to install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. You can install it directly from the browser or from Microsoft Store. Whichever approach you use, it's the same app. The difference is that  installing from the browser lets you install the app for each environment when there's more than one.

### From Microsoft Store

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2182870).
2. Choose **Get** > **Install**. 
3. When the app has been installed, choose **Open**, then sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The next time you want to open the app, look for it in **Start** menu.

### From the browser

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client in either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

2. If the page for selecting the environment appears, you can do one of two things:

   - Select the environment and go to the next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment you select.
   - Don't select the environment, and just go to next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment selection page, instead of a specific environment.

3. To install the app, depending on your browser, select ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central**, then **Install**.

   | Microsoft Edge | Google Chrome |
   |--|--|
   | :::image type="content" source="media/ui-edge-install-app-v2.png" alt-text="illustration of a button for installing an app in Edge."::: | :::image type="content" source="media/ui-chrome-install-app-v2.png" alt-text="illustration of a button for installing an app in Chrome."::: |

  > [!TIP]
  > With Edge, you can also install the app by going to the **Settings and more** menu in the browser, then selecting **Apps** > **Install this site as an app** > **Install**.

Once installed, the app appears in the **Start** menu. If you've selected a specific environment for the app, the environment name is added to the app name in the **Start** menu.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Installing the desktop app when you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises is done directly from the browser as [described above](#from-the-browser). If you only have one tenant, just open [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your browser, and select either ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central** as shown above.

The difference is when you have multiple tenants. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, where you can install the app for different environments, you can only install the app for one tenant. So before you install the app when you have multiple tenants, be sure to switch to the correct tenant. Once installed, when you open the app, it will directly open the tenant.

# Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners
When you use intercompany postings to transfer documents between partner companies, the VAT-related settings (primarily the VAT business posting group) assigned to the customer or vendor accounts (associated with the intercompany Partner) control whether, and how, VAT is calculated and registered. 
You can also do cost distributions directly from a purchase order to partner companies. For example, if you register a purchase invoice from an external vendor and you want to distribute some or all of the costs to one or more intercompany partners.

You can allocate costs can be to one or more intercompany partners using the following:

* **Intercompany General Journals** - These journals are useful when a service is purchased. For example, when a parent company hires a service to set up computer systems in two subsidiaries. The invoice is sent to the parent company, but the costs are allocate to the intercompany partners. For more information, see [Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md).
* Purchase orders and invoices - Using purchase documents is useful when the purchasing functions of, for example, operating expenses, are centralized in one company and then allocated to the intercompany partners.

## To allocate costs using an intercompany general journal
To enter a  line in an intercompany general journal, follow these steps. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journal** , and then choose the related link.
2. If required, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the document number on the invoice from the vendor.
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Invoice**.
4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Vendor**.
5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the vendor.
6. In the **Amount** field, enter a negative amount equal to the amount on the invoice.
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, choose the balancing account to use.
9. To allocate costs to intercompany partners, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new line.
   2. Leave the **Document Type** field, choose the option that leaves the field blank.
   3. In the **Document No.** field, enter a number that is different than the number in the **External Document No.** field. The cost allocation is considered a different transaction.
   4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **IC Partner**.
   5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
   6. In the **Balance Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   7. In the **Balance Account No.** field, choose the G/L account to which to post the amount you receive from the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of the invoice to allocate to the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, choose the G/L account that you want to post the amount to for the intercompany partner. 
   1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for each intercompany partner who should share in the cost.
1. To post the document and allocate the costs, choose **Post**.  

## To allocate costs using a purchase document
The following procedure describes how to allocate costs using a purchase invoice. The steps are the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete these steps you must personalize the **Purchase Invoice** page by adding the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Partner Ref. Type**, and **IC Partner** fields. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** , and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   
   G/L Account is the only option you can use to allocate costs.  
1. In the **No.** field, choose the G/L account to post to.
1. In the **IC Partner Code** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
1. In the **IC Partner Ref. Type** choose the G/L account to use for the allocation. This account will map the expense to an account in the intercomany partner's chart of accounts.
1. In the **Quantity** field, specify the number of units to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT (or Incl. VAT)** field, enter the cost per item to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
1. To post the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## To send the allocated costs to intercompany partners
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IC Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose lines to send, and then choose the **Send to IC Partner** action. 
3. To allocate the costs, choose the **Complete Line Actions** action.

## Calculating VAT for Cost Distributions
When you use a document to distribute costs to intercompany partners, there are two VAT settings to be aware of: 
* The settings on the G/L account for expenses:
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are set up on the G/L account, then the calculation depends on the groups and the product groups from the document line.
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are not specified on the G/L account, the calculation depends on the following:
* The posting group settings on the intercompany partner
   * Whether the intercompany partner is assigned to a customer number that does not have a general business or VAT business posting groups specified.
   * There is no customer number associated with the intercompany partner. Then the general business or VAT business posting groups are blank, and the line in the VAT posting setup is used, which is usually a group where 0% VAT is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to validate both the intercompany partner setup and the G/L account setup (for the expense account used for the cost distribution) before you allocate costs to intercompany partners.

# Manage product variants

Item variants are a great way to keep your list of products under control. For example, you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary only in color. You can define each variant as a separate item. But you can also choose to set up one item and specify the various colors as variants of the item.  

> [!TIP]
> For a practical introduction to using variants in production, see [Walkthrough: Variants](contoso-coffee/manufacturing/variants.md) for the Contoso Coffee demo data.  

## Add variants to an item

It's easy enough to define variants for an item.  

### To add variants

1. Open [the **Items List** page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=31), open the relevant item.  
2. On the **Item** card, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then choose the **Variants** action.  
3. On the **Item Variants** page, list the variants.  

Then, when you create a sales document and add the item, you can specify the variant of the item in the Variant **Code** field. The same applies to purchasing documents.  

## Item availability by variant

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Require use of variants

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, admins can require that users specify the variant in documents and journals for items that have variants. To activate the capability, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and select the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field. You can override this global setting for specific items.  

On item cards, the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field has the following options:

|Field value |Description|
|---------|----|
|Default (No)| The setting from **Inventory Setup** applies to this item.|
|No| Users aren't required to specify a variant for this item.|
|Yes| If the item has one or more variants, users must specify the relevant variant. If they don't, they're blocked from posting the transaction.|

> [!NOTE]
> These settings don't affect items that don't have variants.

If the capability is switched on, you can't post an entry if the variant isn't specified.

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.
