# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

# Record payments and refunds in the payment journal

On the **Payment Journals** page, you record payments that you make to vendors and refunds that you make to customers. When you post a payment journal line, the paid amount is recorded on the specified bank account. You must then take steps to perform the actual money transfer from the related bank account.  

Payment journals are general journals that are optimized for making payments. You can quickly add lines manually, you can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggest vendor payments, and you can apply the payment to posted documents. Although you're making payments, you enter a positive amount in the **Document Amount** field. Depending on the document type for the journal line, this amount is then converted to a negative amount in the underlying transactions. This way, it's faster for you to add journal lines manually. If you prefer to enter negative amounts, you can personalize the payment journal to show the **Amount** field instead. To learn more about personalizing pages, go to [Start personalizing by using the personalization mode](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).  

- Applying payments to invoices or credit memos

    If you fill in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field with the invoice or credit memo to pay or refund, the document is set to **Paid** when you post the journal. This setting is referred to as "applied." As an alternative to applying when you post a payment, you can use the **Apply Vendor Entries** and **Apply Customer Entries** pages after you post the payment. To learn more, go to, for example, [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

- Get suggested payments to vendors or employees

    The **Suggest Vendor Payments** and **Suggest Employee Payments** actions can help you fill in payment journal lines automatically according to vendor prioritization and due dates. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md). With this function, the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field is always filled in.  

- Print checks and submit payments electronically to your bank

    In addition to recording that the payment is made, you can also use the **Payment Journal** page to output the payment for further processing by your bank. To learn more, go to [Make Check Payments](payables-how-work-checks.md) and [Make Electronic Payments](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

## To make payments in the payment journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal batch that you use for payments.
3. If you know who to pay, fill in the fields manually. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To also apply the payment to the related invoice or credit memo, choose the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, on the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the relevant invoice or credit memo, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Many fields, such as the **Document Amount** and **Due Date** fields, now contain information from the selected document.
5. Alternatively, use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action. All the applies-to information and amounts are also entered on the journal lines. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).
6. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post** action.

## To issue a refund check

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Document Type** field, select **Refund**.  
3. In the **External Document No.** field, enter a reference for the refund check (for example, the return order number).  
4. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.  
5. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer's account number that the refund check is being issued to.  
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be refunded.  
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.  
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account the check comes out of.  
9. In the **Applies To Doc. No.** field, select the documents that require a refund.  
10. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post/Print** action, choose the **Post and Print** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Archive documents

You can archive sales, purchase, and service orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders. If you're using Project Management features, you can also archive your projects. You can archive documents and projects several times. A different archived version saves each time.

For sales documents, if the original still exists and isn't posted, you can use the **Restore** action to overwrite it with an archived version.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only restore sales documents and projects. The action isn't available for archived purchase documents.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can reuse the content by copying the data, for example, by using the **Copy from Document** action.  

To explore archived documents, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Archive**, and then choose the related link. If the archive you're interested in doesn't display right away in the **Go to Reports and Analysis** section, you might need to choose **Show more**.

## To set up automatic document archiving

You can automate archiving to create a new version of the archived document when someone does the following things:

* Changes the status or deletes a document or project.
* Prints, downloads, or sends a document by email.
* Converts a quote to an order or invoice.
* Posts an order.

The following steps describe how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents from the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. The steps are similar for purchase documents and projects.

* For purchase documents, use the **Purchase & Payables** page.
* For projects, use the **Project Setup** page.
* For services, use the **Service Management Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Archiving** FastTab, specify whether to turn on automatic archiving for the various types of sales documents. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

The following table describes the options for the **Archive Quotes** field.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Never**| Don't archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Question**|Prompt the user to choose whether to archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Always**|Archive a sales quote automatically when you delete it.|

## To manually archive a sales order

The following procedure describes how to manually archive a sales order. The steps are similar for all documents and projects that you can archive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a sales order that you want to archive.  
3. Choose the **Archive Document** action.

The sales order is archived. You can view it on the **Archived Sales Orders** page.

## To restore a nonposted sales document or a project from the archive

You can restore documents only if the original document isn't posted.

The following procedure describes how to restore an archived sales order to the original sales order. The steps are similar for all orders, blanket orders, return orders, and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order Archives**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the archived sales order, or version of it, that you want to restore, and then choose the **Restore** action.  

The contents of the original sales order or project are replaced with the archived version.

## To delete archived versions

Use a retention policy to clean up archived versions that you no longer need. Retention policies let administrators define how long they want to store data. For example, they can set up a policy that deletes data after an expiration date. To learn more, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

There are a few things to note about creating retention policies for archived documents and projects:

* If the original document isn’t deleted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you can’t delete the archived versions. Archived versions don’t expire as long as the original exists.
* When you set up the retention policy, you can specify that you want the policy to delete all archived versions except the most recent. For example, you might have 10 versions and want to keep a copy of the latest. 
* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the expiration date for documents based on the date of the most recent archived version.

# Depreciation methods for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports eight different methods of depreciation for fixed assets:

* Straight-Line (SL)
* Declining-Balance 1 (DB1)
* Declining-Balance 2 (DB2)
* DB1/SL
* DB2/SL
* Half-Year Convention
* Manual
* User-defined depreciation

## Straight-Line depreciation

With Straight-Line depreciation, you deprecate the asset value either with a fixed yearly percentage or with a fixed yearly amount over the depreciation period. When you use the straight-line method, you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book:  

* The depreciation period (years or months) or a depreciation ending date  
* A fixed yearly percentage  
* A fixed yearly amount  
* Depreciation period  

### Depreciation period

If you enter the depreciation period (the number of depreciation years, the number of depreciation months, or the depreciation ending date), the following formula calculates the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = ((Book value - Salvage Value) x Number of Depreciation Days) / Remaining Depreciation Days*  

The remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the depreciation starting date and the last fixed asset entry date.  

Book value can be reduced by posted appreciation, write-down, custom 1, or custom 2 amounts depending on whether the **Include in Depr. Calculation** field is deactivated and whether the **Part of Book Value** field is activated on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. This calculation ensures that the fixed asset is fully depreciated at the depreciation ending date.  

### Fixed yearly percentage

If you enter a fixed yearly percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Straight-Line % x Depreciable Basis x Number of Depr. Days) / (100 x 360)*  

### Fixed yearly amount

If you enter a fixed yearly amount, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Fixed Depreciation Amount x Number of Depreciation Days) / 360*  

### Example - Straight-Line depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The estimated life is eight years. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

For this example, the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |93,750.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |87,500.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |75,000.00 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |6,250.00  |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |0         |

## Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

This depreciation method allocates the largest part of an asset's cost to the early years of its useful lifetime. If you use this method, you must enter a fixed yearly percentage.  

The following formula calculates depreciation amounts:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Declining-Bal. % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*  

The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year. The number of depreciation days are the number of days between the posting date and the last depreciation date. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates depreciation assuming that any depreciation done in the fiscal year is done with this formula.  

The posted depreciation amount can contain entries with various posting types (write-down, custom1, and custom2) posted since the starting date of the current fiscal year. These posting types are included in the posted depreciation amount if there are check marks in the **Depreciation Type** and the **Part of Book Value** fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.  

### Example 1 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |

| ...      |             |    |          |          |

Calculation method:  

* Year 1: *25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*
* Year 2: *25% of 75,000 = 18,750 = 9,375 + 9,375*
* Year 3: *25% of 56,250 = 14,062.50 = 7,031.25 + 7,031.25*
* ...

The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered.  

### Example 2 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 1,778 on 2/2/23, which is the expected (proportional) amount of the year's depreciation at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 3 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

If you post an amount that doesn't align with the Declining Balance 1 depreciation method, for example, 5,000, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests the remainder of the expected amount.

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 5,000 on 2/2/2023, which is more than the expected (proportional) amount on 2/2/2023 at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 4 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2023. You post a depreciation of 95,000 on 2/2/2023, which exceeds the allowed depreciation amount for the year. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5000, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula: 

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

However, the remaining book value is only 5,000, so [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5,000 because a book value can't be negative.

## Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

The Declining-Balance 1 and Declining-Balance 2 methods calculate the same total depreciation amount for each year. However, if you run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job more than once a year, the Declining-Balance 1 method results in equal depreciation amounts for each depreciation period. The Declining-Balance 2 method, on the other hand, results in depreciation amounts that decline for each period.  

### Example - Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually. The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date     | FA Posting Type  | Days                       | Amount    | Book Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------  | --------- | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date)|100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-13,397.46 | 86,602.54 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-11,602.54 | 75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-10,048.09 | 64,951.91 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-8,701.91  | 56,250.00 |
| ...      |                  |                            |           |           |

Calculation Method:  

* *BV* = Book value  
* *ND* = Number of depreciation days  
* *DBP* = Declining-balance percent  
* *P* = *DBP*/100  
* *D* = *ND*/360  

The formula to calculate the depreciation amounts is:  

* *DA* = *BV* x (1 – (1 –P)<sup>D</sup>)

The depreciation values are:  

| Date     | Calculation                                                |
| -------- | -----------                                                |
| 06/30/20 |DA = 100,000.00 x (1 -(1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 13,397.46 |
| 12/31/20 |DA = 86,602.54 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 11,602.54 |
| 06/30/21 |DA = 75,000.00 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 10,048.09 |
| 12/31/21 |DA = 64,951.91 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 8,701.91  |
| ...      |                                                            |

## DB1/SL depreciation

DB1/SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line. The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount, or the salvage value that you entered.  

The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job calculates a straight-line amount and a declining balance amount, but only the greater of the two amounts are transferred to the journal.  

You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance.  

If you use this method, you must enter the estimated useful lifetime and a declining balance percentage on the **FA Depreciation Books** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use any of the declining balance depreciation methods, and you want to run depreciation for multiple years, you must run each year's depreciation separately. If you run depreciation for the whole period from acquisition date to the end of the last fiscal year or last accounting period, it's likely that the results will be incorrect. For example, you might want to run it for multiple years if you have imported legacy data and you use the actual acquisition dates for your assets and want to catch up on accumulated depreciation. For declining balance methods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the allowed depreciation per year, starting with the registered book value for each year. It can't do a multi-year depreciation in one step.
>
> The **Fixed asset - Projected Value** report can project depreciations for multi-year periods, which might be confusing compared to the results you get if you run depreciations for multiple years using one of the declining balance methods. 

### Example - DB1-SL depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 25 and the **No. of Depreciation Years** field contains **8**. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| 06/30/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |19,775.38 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |15,820.30 SL |
| 06/30/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |11,865.22 SL |
| 12/31/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |7,910.15 SL |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |3,955.07 SL |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1 (2020):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*  

    *Straight-line amount = 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 = 6,250 + 6,250*  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2025):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 23,730.46 = 4,943.85= 2,471.92 + 2,471.92*  

    *Straight-line amount = 23,730.46/3 = 7,910.15 = 3,995.07 + 3,995.08*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Half-Year Convention depreciation

The Half-Year Convention method is only applied if you turn on the **Use Half-Year Convention** toggle for the fixed asset on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.  

You can use this depreciation method with the following depreciation methods:  

* Straight-Line  
* Declining-Balance 1  
* DB1/SL  

When you apply the Half-Year Convention method, a fixed asset has six months of depreciation in the first fiscal year, regardless of the contents of the **Depreciation Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The estimated life of the fixed asset that is remaining after the first fiscal year will always contain a half-year using the Half-Year Convention Method. Thus, for the Half-Year Convention method to be applied correctly, the **Depreciation Ending Date** field on the **FA Depreciation Book** page must always contain a date which is exactly six months before the final date of the fiscal year in which the fixed asset will fully depreciate.  

### Example - Half-Year Convention depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 03/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-10,000.00 |90,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |70,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |50,000.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |30,000.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |10,000.00 |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-10,000.00 |0.00 |

## Example - DB1/SL depreciation using Half-Year Convention

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 11/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 40. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |60 |-20,000.00 |80,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-32,000.00 |48,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-19,200.00 |28,800.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |17,280.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |5,760.00 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-5,760.00 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1:  

    *Declining-balance amount = Full year amount = 40% of 100,000 = 40,000.* Thus, for half a year 40,000 / 2 = 20,000  

    *Straight-line amount = Full year amount = 100,000 / 5 = 20,000.* Thus, for half a year = 20,000 / 2 = 10,000  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2024):  

    *Declining-balance amount = 40% of 17,280.00 = 6,912.00*  

    *Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Duplicate entries to other depreciation books

If you have three depreciation books, B1, B2 and B3, and you want to duplicate entries from B1 to B2 and B3, you can turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle on the depreciation book cards for B2 and B3. For example, this setting can be useful in the following situations:

* Depreciation book B1 integrates with the general ledger and uses the fixed asset G/L journal.
* Depreciation books B2 and B3 don't integrate with the general ledger and use the fixed asset journal.  

When you make an entry in B1 in the fixed asset G/L journal, and turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] duplicates the entry in book B2 and B3 in the fixed asset journal when you post the entry.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you're duplicating from. If you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G/L journal using another batch.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the same number series in the fixed asset G/L journal and the fixed asset journal. When you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you must leave the **Document No.** field empty. If you enter a number in the field, the number is duplicated in the fixed asset journal. You'll have to manually change the document number before you can post the journal.  

## Manual depreciation

Use the manual method for assets that aren't subject to depreciation, for example, land. You must enter depreciation in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method.

## User-defined depreciation

If the built-in depreciation methods don't meet your needs, you can define your own depreciation method by using depreciation tables. To learn more about applying a user-defined depreciation method, go to [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

# Design details: accounts in the general ledger

To reconcile inventory and capacity ledger entries with the general ledger, the related value entries are posted to different accounts in the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## From the Inventory Ledger  

The following table shows the relationship between different types of inventory value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger.  

|**Item Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Variance Type**|**Expected Cost**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||Yes|Inventory  (Interim)|Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|Direct Cost Applied|

|Assembly Output|Variance|Capacity Overhead|No|Inventory|Cap. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Variance|Manufacturing Overhead|No|Inventory|Mfg. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  

## From the Capacity Ledger  

 The following table shows the relationship between different types of capacity value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger. Capacity ledger entries represent labor time consumed in assembly or production work.  

|**Work Type**|**Capacity Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Assembly|Resource|Direct Cost|Direct Cost Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Assembly|Resource|Indirect Cost|Overhead Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Direct Cost|WIP Account|Direct Cost Applied|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Indirect Cost|WIP Account|Overhead Applied|  

## Assembly costs are always actual  

 As shown in the table above, assembly postings are not represented in interim accounts. This is because the concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly output posting, unlike in production output posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Calculating the amount to post to the general ledger  

 The following fields in the **Value Entry** table are used to calculate the expected cost amount that is posted to the general ledger:  

- Cost Amount (Actual)  
- Cost Posted to G/L  
- Cost Amount (Expected)  
- Expected Cost Posted to G/L  

The following table shows how the amounts to post to the general ledger are calculated for the two different cost types.  

|Cost Type|Calculation|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Actual Cost|Cost Amount (Actual) – Cost Posted to G/L|  
|Expected Cost|Cost Amount (Expected) –  Expected Cost Posted to G/L|

# Exchanging Data
You can exchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external files or streams in connection with common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the data files or streams. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, and the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you distribute bank file conversions to an external service provider. For more information, see [Setting Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Track Relations Between Demand and Supply

From any supply or demand document in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan. For more information, see [Untracked Planning Elements](production-how-track-demand-supply.md#untracked-planning-elements).

## To track linked items
Order tracking shows how sales orders, production orders, and purchase orders are related to the manufacturing order through the planning and reservation systems.

The following describes how to track linked items on a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for all other order types, and from planning worksheet lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant firm planned production order from the list.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.

The lines in the **Order Tracking** display the documents that are related to the current production order line.

## Untracked Planning Elements
The **Untracked Planning Elements** page opens when you choose the **Untracked Qty.** field on the **order Planning** page. It serves two purposes:

1. To hold information about untracked quantities displayed when the user looks up from the Order Tracking page to see untracked quantities.
2. To hold warning messages displayed when the user chooses the **Warning** icon on the **Planning Worksheet** page.

The page contains entries which account for an untracked surplus quantity in order tracking network. These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# About the Data Exchange Framework

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.

 The following diagrams show the architecture of the data exchange framework.  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Import.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_import.png)  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Export.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_export.png)  

## Electronic documents

As an alternative to emailing business documents as file attachments, you can send and receive them electronically. An "electronic document" is a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Trading partners exchange electronic documents through external document exchange services. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. Currently, Avalara and Pagero exchange services are pre-configured and ready to be set up for your company (Microsoft will support more exchange services in near future). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you must check if they're already delivered in your localization to create new data exchange definitions.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

To send, for example, a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, read this [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments.md). The data conversion and sending of the PEPPOL sales invoice are performed by dedicated codeunits and XMLports.  

To receive, for example, an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, read the following [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). You can either set up the Job Queue feature to process such files regularly or you can start the process manually. For both sales and purchase processes, first, [you must set up](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) various master data, such as services, company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when you convert data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The receiving and data conversion of PEPPOL invoices are performed by the Data Exchange Framework.  

To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you process it the same way as you would when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. The receiving and conversion of electronic documents from OCR are performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition.  

## Bank files

The formats of files for exchanging bank data with business management applications vary depending on the supplier of the file and the country or region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import and export of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank files. Additionally, the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension lets you connect to a AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension provided by an external provider, AMC Consult. For more information, see [Make Payments with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the Data Exchange Framework.  

To export SEPA credit transfers, you choose **Export Payments to File** button on the **Payment Journal** page and then upload the file to process the payments in your bank. First you must set up various master data, such as bank account, vendors, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by a dedicated codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Credit Transfer** bank export/import setup. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the export, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension - Credit Transfer** data exchange definition.  

 To export SEPA direct debit instructions, you choose the **Export Direct Debit File** button on the **Direct Debit Collections** page and then send to your bank to automatically collect the involved customer payments. First you must set up bank accounts, customers, direct-debit mandates, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by dedicated a codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Direct Debit** bank export/import setup.  

 To import SEPA bank statements, you choose the Import Bank Statement button in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages and then you proceed to apply each bank statement entry to payments or bank ledger entries, manually or automatically. First you must set up bank accounts. The import and data conversion of SEPA bank data is performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the import, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension – Bank Statement** data exchange definition.  

 In addition, the local versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support various other file formats for importing and exporting bank data, payroll transactions, and other data. For more information, see the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) landing page for your country/region in the Help.  

## Currency exchange rates

You can set up an external service to keep your for currency exchange rates up to date. The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition. Accordingly, the **Exch. Rate Update Setup Card** page is a condensed view of the **Data Exchange Definition** page for the data exchange definition in question.  

For all exchanges of data in XML files, you can prepare the data exchange setup by loading the related XML schema file on the **XML Schema Viewer** page. Here you select the data elements that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  and then you either initialize a data exchange definition or generate an XMLport.

## Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the Data Exchange Framework for Intrastat reporting where you can easily create timestamped files in different formats for export. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains prepared formats for localized countries/regions and for default version. But you can change the out-of-box report or make your own.

# Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation

You can use various methods of depreciation for preparing financial statements and income tax returns. Many large corporations use straight-line depreciation in their financial statements because this generally permits reporting higher earnings. For income tax purposes, however, many businesses use an accelerated depreciation method, such as declining-balance depreciation. You define an asset's depreciation method with the **Depreciation Method** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page. For more information about what the different methods do, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).

You set up depreciation books where you define the different ways depreciation must be calculated for different types of fixed assets. Each depreciation book specifies individual depreciation terms. For example, you can specify that a fixed asset should be depreciated over a period of three years in one book and over a period of five years in another book.

When you have created the relevant depreciation books, you must assign one or more depreciation books to each fixed asset. A depreciation book that is assigned to a fixed asset is referred to as a fixed asset depreciation book. You can set up an unlimited number of depreciation books for a fixed asset.  

## To create a depreciation book

In a fixed asset depreciation book, you specify how fixed assets are depreciated. To accommodate various methods of depreciation, you can set up multiple depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Depreciation Books List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Follow the next step to define which type of journal is used for the different fixed asset activities by default.
4. On the **Integration** FastTab, select the check box for each fixed asset activity whose transactions you want to post using the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each depreciation method or posting method that you want to assign to fixed assets as a depreciation book.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Choose the **Use Rounding in Periodic Depr.** field to round the calculated periodic depreciation amounts to whole numbers. For example, if your company also uses invoice rounding to whole numbers in the **General Ledger Setup** page, rounding also depreciation amounts to whole numbers can help provide transparency.

For example, if you dispose of a fixed asset where the depreciation book does not specify rounding, but your company's general ledger setup requires rounding, then, when you dispose of the fixed asset, you will see an error message that an amount must be rounded on a ledger entry.  

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Depreciation Books** action to specify one or more fixed asset depreciation books.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   When you use the manual depreciation method, you must enter depreciation manually in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** function omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method. You can use this method for assets that are not subject to depreciation, such as land.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use the user-defined depreciation method, you need to assign the depreciation book in a different way. For more information, see [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

## To assign a depreciation book to multiple fixed assets with a batch job

If you want to assign a depreciation book to several fixed assets, you can use the **Create FA Depreciation Books** batch job to create fixed asset depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a assign a depreciation book to, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, choose the **Create FA Depreciation Books** action.
4. On the **Create FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Depreciation Book** field.
5. Choose the **Copy from FA No.** field, and then select the fixed asset number that you want to use as the basis for creating new fixed asset depreciation books.

    If you fill in this field, the depreciation fields in the new fixed asset depreciation books will contain the same information as the corresponding fields in the fixed asset depreciation book that you copy from. Leave the field blank if you want to create new fixed asset depreciation books with empty depreciation fields.  
6. On the **Fixed Asset** FastTab, you can set a filter to select the assets that you want to create the fixed asset depreciation books for.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

## To set up depreciation posting types

For each depreciation book, you must set up how you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle various posting types. For example, whether posting should be debit or credit and whether the posting type should be included in the depreciable basis.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to set up, and them choose the **FA Posting Type Setup** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Type Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You cannot insert or delete lines on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. You can only modify the existing lines.

We recommend that you do not change the setup for depreciation books for entries that have already been posted. Changes will not affect the entries that are already posted, which would make depreciation book statistics misleading.

## To set up default templates and batches for fixed asset depreciation

For each depreciation book, you define a default setup of templates and batches. You use these defaults to duplicate lines from one journal to another, create journal lines using the **Calculate Depreciation** or **Index Fixed Assets** batch jobs, duplicate acquisition costs in the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to define default journals for, and then choose the **FA Journal Setup** action.  
3. If you want to have a default setup for each user, choose the **User ID** field to select from the **Users** page.  
4. In the other fields, select the journal template or journal batch that must be used by default.  

## Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation

When the Calculate Depreciation batch job calculates depreciations, the batch job normally uses a standardized year of 360 days where each of the 12 months has 30 days.

If you select this field, the Calculate Depreciation batch job uses the calendar year of 365 days instead, where each month is calculated with the same number of days as in the calendar. The only exception is February in leap years, which the batch job will treat as having 28 days and not 29. Because of that, all years, also leap years, are considered to have 365 days.

# Set up a sequence of workflow users

Before you can create approval workflows, you must set up the users who can submit requests and their approvers. For example, you can specify who receives a notification to act on a workflow step. You set up approval workflow participants on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

On the **Workflow User Groups** page, you can specify where a participant engages in an approval workflow by entering a number in the **Sequence No.** field. For example, you can specify that users engage in a sequential order, such as a chain of approvers. You can also specify a flat list of approvers by entering the same number. In the latter case, only one of the approvers must approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

## To set up a workflow user group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill in the fields on the first line, as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User Name**|Specify the user who takes part in a workflow.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).|
   |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can specify, for example, when the user approves relative to other approvers by setting up the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, sequence numbers are sequential for users in a workflow user group. However, multiple users can have the same sequence number. When that's the case, only one of the users must approve a request before the workflow goes to the next step. For example, if user A and user B are both number two in the sequence, the workflow goes to the step three when when either user A or user B approves the request.
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the workflow user group.

# Manage human resources

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

You can also register employee absences, which allows you to analyze registered absences as necessary.

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.

## To correct a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

## To cancel a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# Post the Year-End Closing entry

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your organizations work processes, you can choose to close or not close accounting periods and fiscal years in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure assumes that you have closed the fiscal year using the *Accounting Periods* option, generated a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** batch job, and are now ready to post the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries. Your organization can choose to work differently, such as post the year-end closing entry as part of closing the fiscal year.

## To post the year end closing entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Journals** page, in the **Batch Name** field, select the batch that contains the closing entries.
3. Review the entries.
4. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the posted entries are removed from the journal. After posting is complete, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Sort, search, and filter data in lists, reports, or XMLports

A few mechanisms are available to help you scan, find, and limit the records in a list, a report, or an XMLport. They include operations like sorting, searching, and filtering. You can apply some or all of these operations simultaneously to quickly find or analyze your data.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For reports and XMLports, as for lists, you can set filters to delimit the data that is included. However, you can't sort or search.

> [!TIP]
> When you view your data as tiles, you can search and use filtering. However, the full set of powerful features for sorting, searching, and filtering is available only when you view the records as a list. To switch from the tile view to the list view, select the ![Show as list.](media/ui_show_as_list_icon.png "Show as list arrow left") button.

<!--
When you want to search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or product groups, you enter criteria. In search criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the specific field. In addition, you can use special symbols to further filter the results. There are two ways to search: using the Quick Filter or column filters.
-->

## Sorting

Sorting makes it easy to get a quick overview of your data. For example, if you have many customers, you can sort them by **Customer No.**, **Currency Code**, or **Country Region Code** value to get the overview that you need.

To sort a list, follow one of these steps:

- Select the text of a column heading to switch between ascending and descending order.
- Select the dropdown arrow in the column heading, and then select either the **Ascending** action or the **Descending** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting isn't supported for images, binary large object (BLOB) fields, FlowFilters, and fields that don't belong to a table.

## Searching

At the top of each list page is a ![Search list.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** button that provides a quick and easy way to reduce the number of records in a list and show only those records that contain the data that you're interested in.

To search, select the **Search** button or the <kbd>F3</kbd> key on your keyboard. Then enter the text that you're looking for in the search field. The search text that you enter can include letters, numbers, and other symbols.

![Screenshot that shows the search field.](media/ui-search/search-list-box.png)

In general, search tries to match text across all fields. It doesn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters (in other words, it's case-insensitive). It also matches text that occurs anywhere in the field: at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

> [!NOTE]
> Search doesn't match values in images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, FlowFields, and other fields that aren't part of a table.

### Choose between modern search and legacy search

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

On the most common pages, such as **Customers**, **Contacts**, and **Items**, you can select the dropdown arrow in the search field and then select between two search options on the menu: **Use modern search** and **Use legacy search**.

![Screenshot that shows the Use modern search and Use legacy search options on the dropdown menu for a search field.](media/ui-search/search-modern-legacy-options.png)

*Legacy search* is the older search method. It's the only method that is available in Business Central 2024 release wave 1 and earlier. *Modern search* is a newer, faster, and more flexible search method. The key difference is that legacy search finds only records that contain the exact words that you enter, in the exact order that you enter them in, whereas modern search finds records that contain matching words in any order.

For example, the CRONUS demo company has an item that is named **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue**. If you enter `London chair` as the search text, legacy search doesn't return any results, because that exact text doesn't match any part of the item name. However, modern search finds the item by matching the words "London" and "chair" separately.

If you want to find all blue chairs in the CRONUS demo company, you might enter either `blue chair` or `chair blue` as the search text. In this case, modern search retrieves not only **LONDON Swivel Chair, blue** but also **TOKYO Guest Chair, blue**. However, once again, legacy search returns no results. To get results by using legacy search, you must enter `chair, blue` as the search text.

If you want to mimic the behavior of legacy search when you use modern search, you can enclose your search text in quotation marks, just as you can do in popular search engines. In this way, you refine the results by excluding any that aren't exact matches. For example, if you enter `"blue chair"` as the search text, modern search returns no results, because that exact text doesn't occur in any item name in the demo data.

Another difference is that modern search finds words that *start* with the letters you have entered. If you enter 'hair', it won't find the word 'chair'.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Modern search covers only columns that a developer designates for it. If you can't find existing data, try legacy search.
>
>   Learn more about how to designate columns for modern search in [Enable optimized text search on table fields](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-field-text-search).
>
> - The search indexes used for modern search are updated in the background, usually within a few seconds. But in some cases, recent data changes don't immediately show up in modern search results.
>
> - If the **Use modern search** option isn't available on the dropdown menu, one of the following factors might be the cause:
>
>   - Modern search isn't enabled for your environment. Administrators can enable the **Use optimized text search in lists** feature on the **Feature Management** page. Learn more in [Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time](admin-feature-management.md).
>   - The list doesn't include any columns that are designated for modern search.
>
> - If modern search is enabled for your environment, it's the default search method.

### Fine-tune the search by using filter criteria (legacy search only)

You can make a more exact search by using filter operators, expressions, and filter tokens. Unlike filtering, these criteria are applied across all fields when they're used in the search field. Therefore, they're less efficient than filtering.

- To find only field values that exactly match the entire search text, and the case of it, enclose the text in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, enter `'man'`.
- To find field values that start with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) after the text. For example, enter `man*`.
- To find field values that end with specific text and match the case of it, add an asterisk (`*`) before the text. For example, enter `*man`.
- When you use single quotation marks (`''`) or asterisks (`*`), the search is case-sensitive. To make it case-insensitive, add an at sign (`@`) before the search text. For example, enter `@man*`.

The following table provides some examples to explain how you can use the search.

| Search criterion | Information that is found |
|---|---|
| `man` or `Man` | All records where the value of any field contains the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, **manual**, or **Sportsman**. |
| `'Man'` | All records where the value of any field contains only the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. |
| `Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the exact text **Man**, where the "M" is uppercase, and the "an" is lowercase. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester**, but not the value **manual** or **Sportsman**. |
| `@Man*` | All records where the value of any field starts with the text **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Manchester** or **manual**, but not the value **Sportsman**. |
| `@*man` | All records where the value of any field ends with **man**, regardless of the case. For example, the search finds records where any field has the value **Sportsman**, but not the value **Manchester** or **manual**. |

## <a name="filtering"></a>Filtering

Filtering provides a more advanced and versatile way to control which records are included in a list, a report, or an XMLport. There are two major differences between searching and filtering, as the following table shows.

| | Searching | Filtering |
|---|---|---|
| **Applicable fields** | Search across all fields that are visible on the page. | Filter one or more fields individually. Select from any field in the table, including fields that aren't visible on the page. |
| **Matching** | Show records where field values match the search text, regardless of the text's case or placement in the field. | Show records where field values exactly match the filter, including the text's case, unless special filter symbols are entered.

By specifying filter criteria, you can show records for specific accounts or customers, dates, amounts, and other information. Only records that match the criteria are shown in the list or included in the report, batch job, or XMLport. If you specify criteria for multiple fields, only records that match all criteria are shown.

For lists, the filters are shown in a filter pane that appears to the left of the list when you activate it. For reports, batch jobs, and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page.

### Filter by using option fields

For "ordinary" fields that hold data, setup date, or business data, you can set filters both by selecting data and by entering filter values. You can also use symbols to define advanced filter criteria. Learn more in the [Enter filter criteria](#enter-filter-criteria) section.

However, for fields of the **Option** type, you can set a filter only by selecting one or more available options in a dropdown list. An example of an option field is the **Status** field on the **Sales Orders** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select multiple options as a filter value, the relationship between the options is defined as *OR*. For example, if you select both the **Open** checkbox and the **Released** checkbox in the **Status** filter field on the **Sales Orders** page, the page shows all sales orders that are either open or released.

### Set filters on lists

For lists, you set filters by using the filter pane. To show the filter pane for a list, select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the page, and then select the **Show filter pane** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

To show the filter pane for a column in a list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>. The filter pane appears, and the selected column is shown as a filter field in the **Filter list by** section.

The filter pane shows the current filters for a list. You can set your own custom filters on one or more fields by selecting the **+&nbsp;Filter** action.

The filter pane is divided into three sections: **Views**, **Filter list by**, and **Filter totals by**:

- **Views** – Some lists include the **Views** section. *Views* are variations of the list that are preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want for each list. The views are available to you on any device that you sign in to. Learn more in [Save and personalize list views](ui-views.md).
- **Filter list by** – This section is where you add filters on specific fields to reduce the number of records that are shown. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.
- **Filter totals by** – Some lists that show calculated fields, such as amounts and quantities, include the **Filter totals by** section. Here, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter the list by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Filters in the **Filter totals by** section are controlled by FlowFilters in the page design. Learn about the technical aspects of FlowFilters in [FlowFilters overview](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-flowfilter-overview).

By using the filter pane, you can set a simple filter directly on a list to show only records that have the same value as a selected cell. Select a cell in the list, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Filter to This Value** action. Alternatively, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.

### Set filters in reports, batch jobs, and XMLports

For reports and XMLports, the filters are visible directly on the request page. The request page shows the last-used filters according to your selection in the **Use default values from** field. Learn more in [Use default values—predefined settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

The main **Filter** section shows the default filter fields that you use to define which records should be included in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

In the **Filter totals by** section, you can adjust various dimensions that influence the calculations in the report or XMLport. To add a filter, select the **+&nbsp;Filter** action. Then enter the name of the field that you want to filter by, or select a field in the dropdown list.

## Enter filter criteria

Both in the filter pane and on a request page, you enter your filter criteria in the box under the filter field.

The type of the filter field determines which criteria you can enter. For example, to filter a field that has fixed values, you can select only among those values. Learn more about special filter symbols in the [Filter criteria and operators](#FilterCriteria) and [Filter tokens](#FilterTokens) sections.

Columns that already have filters are indicated by the ![Filter icon.](media/ui-search/filter-icon.png "Filter icon") symbol in the column heading. To remove a filter, select the dropdown arrow, and then select the **Clear Filter** action.

> [!TIP]
> By learning to use key combinations (keyboard shortcuts), you can find and analyze your data more quickly. For example, select a field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to add that field to the filter pane, enter the filter criteria, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the rows, select another field, and then select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to filter to that value. Learn more in [Search and filter lists](keyboard-shortcuts.md#KeyboardFilter).

### <a name="FilterCriteria"></a>Filter criteria and operators

When you enter criteria, you can use all the numbers and letters that you normally use in the field. In addition, there's a set of special symbols that you can use as operators to further filter the results. The following sections describe these symbols and explain how to use them as operators in filters.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about how to filter dates and times in [Work with calendar dates and times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In some situations, the value that you want to filter on might contain a symbol that is an operator. Learn more about how to handle these situations in the [Filter on values that contain symbols](#symbols) section.
> - If a single filter includes more than 200 operators, the system automatically uses parentheses (`()`) to group some expressions for processing. This behavior has no effect on the filter or the results.

#### (..) Interval

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1100..2100` | Numbers 1100 through 2100 |
| `..2500` | Numbers up to and including 2500 |
| `..12 31 00` | Dates up to and including 12 31 00 |
| `Bicycle..Car` | Strings "Bicycle" through "Car" when they're ordered lexicographically |
| `P8..` | Information for accounting period 8 and later |
| `..23` | From the beginning date until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 |
| `23..` | From 23-current month-current year 0:00:00 until the end of time |
| `22..23` | From 22-current month-current year 0:00:00 until 23-current month-current year 23:59:59 | 

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a numeric keypad, the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key might produce a character other than a period (.). To switch to a period, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key on the keyboard together with the <kbd>Decimal separator</kbd> key on the numeric keypad. To switch back, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> again. Learn more in [Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).

> [!NOTE]
> If you filter on a field of the **Text** type, lexicographic ordering is used to determine what is included in the interval. If a field of the **Text** type is used to store integers, this behavior can lead to unexpected results. For example, a filter on `10000..10042` also includes the values **100000** and **1000042**.

#### (&verbar;) Either/or

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `1200|1300` | Numbers with 1200 or 1300 |

#### (<>) Not equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<>0` | All numbers except 0 |

> [!TIP]
> The SQL Server option lets you combine `<>` with a wildcard expression. For example, `<>A*` means "not equal to any text that starts with *A*."

#### (>) Greater than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>1200` | Numbers greater than 1200 |

#### (>=) Greater than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>=1200` | Numbers greater than or equal to 1200 |

#### (<) Less than

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<1200` | Numbers less than 1200 |

#### (<=) Less than or equal to

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `<=1200` | Numbers less than or equal to 1200 |

#### (&) And

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `>200&<1200` | Numbers greater than 200 and less than 1200 |

#### ('') An exact character match

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `'man'` | Text that exactly matches **man** and is case-sensitive |
| `''` | Text that is empty |

#### (@) Case-insensitive

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `@man*` | Text that starts with **man** and is case-insensitive |

#### (*) An indefinite number of unknown characters

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `*Co*` | Text that contains **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `*Co` | Text that ends with **Co** and is case-sensitive |
| `Co*` | Text that begins with **Co** and is case-sensitive |

#### (?) One unknown character

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `Hans?n` | Text such as **Hansen** or **Hanson** |

#### Combined format expressions

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `5999|8100..8490` | Any records that have the number 5999 or a number in the range from 8100 through 8490 |
| `..1299|1400..` | Records that have a number that is less than or equal to 1299, or a number that is greater than or equal to 1400 (that is, all numbers except 1300 through 1399) |
| `>50&<100 `| Records that have a number that is greater than 50 and less than 100 (that is, all numbers from 51 through 99) |

### <a name="symbols"></a>Filter on values that contain symbols

There might be cases where field values contain one of the following symbols:

- &
- (
- )
- =
- &verbar;

If you want to filter on any of these symbols, enclose the filter expression in single quotation marks (`''`). For example, to filter on records that start with the text **J & V**, the filter expression is `'J & V*'`.

This requirement applies only to the five symbols in the preceding list.

### <a name="FilterTokens"></a>Filter tokens

When you enter filter criteria, you can also enter *filter tokens*, which are words that have special meaning. After you enter a filter token, it's replaced by the value or values that it represents. Filter tokens make filtering easier, because you don't have to open other pages to look up values that you want to add to your filter. The following sections describe some of the tokens that you can enter as filter criteria.

> [!TIP]
> Your organization might use custom tokens. To learn about the complete set of tokens that is available to you, or to add more custom tokens, contact your administrator. Learn about the technical aspects of filter tokens in [Adding Custom Filter Tokens](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-adding-filter-tokens).

#### (%me or %user) Records assigned to you

When you filter fields that contain a user ID, such as the **Assigned to User ID** field, use the `%me` or `%user` filter token to show all records that are assigned to you.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%me` or `%user` | Records that are assigned to your user account |

#### (%mycustomers) Customers in My Customers

In the customer number (**No**) field, use the `%mycustomers` filter token to show all records for customers that are included in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%mycustomers` | Customers in the **My Customers** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myitems) Items in My Items

In the item number (**No**) field, use the `%myitems` filter token to show all records for items that are included in the **My Items** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myitems` | Items in the **My Items** list on your Role Center |

#### (%myvendors) Vendors in My Vendors

In the vendor number (**No**) field, use the `%myvendors` filter token to show all records for vendors that are included in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center.

| Sample expression | Records that are shown |
|---|---|
| `%myvendors` | Vendors in the **My Vendors** list on your Role Center |

# Work with accounting periods and fiscal years

Accounting periods, also known as reporting periods, are periods of time for which a company or organization reports financial performance by generating, for example, their income statement or balance sheet. Typically, accounting periods refer to the company's fiscal year, which can contain several accounting periods, such as months or quarters.

For many companies the fiscal year doesn't align with the calendar year, for instance when the fiscal year ends on June 30 rather than December 31. For newly created companies, the fiscal year might even actually be longer than 12 months.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only requires accounting periods if you want to close an income statement, or run data compression tasks.

You can use accounting periods in reporting such as when you're reviewing posted entries on the **Balance/Budget** page where the reporting interval is specified. One of the options you might specify is to report by accounting period. You can also build a financial report that compares results for different accounting periods.

## Creating a new fiscal year

You can create accounting periods in bulk by using the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job, or by doing so manually.

### How to create accounting periods in bulk

Use the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job to divide a fiscal year into periods of equal length.  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Create Year** action.
3. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts.  
4. In the **No. of Periods** field, enter the number of accounting periods to divide the fiscal year into. There can be up to 365 periods in a year.  
5. In the **Period Length** field, enter a duration for each period. Duration identifiers include 1M for one month, 1Q for one quarter, and 1Y for one year.  
6. Choose **OK**.  

### How to create accounting periods manually

If the accounting periods in your fiscal year have different durations, such as the 4-4-5 calendar used in retail, you can manually set it up.  
  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts. The **Name** field will show the name of the month.  
3. Choose the **New Fiscal Year** check box to indicate that this is the first period in the year. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use this period to determine which periods to close at year-end.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each remaining period.  

## Closing a fiscal year

Closing the fiscal year is one of the tasks for closing the books. After you close a fiscal year, the **Closed** and **Date Locked** check boxes are selected for all periods in the year. You can't reopen a year or clear the check boxes.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must always have at least one open fiscal year. When closing a year, ensure that a new year has been created. Also, note that after you close one year, you cannot change the starting date of the following year.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Close Year** action.  

## Posting entries to a closed fiscal year

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior Year Entry** check box is selected. By default, the check box isn't displayed on the page, but you can add it. The next steps are to close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. Repeat these steps each time you post entries to a closed fiscal year.

# Process sales return orders  

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

## Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Sales Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted sales invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to return that quantity on a new sales return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    -   For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    -   For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    -   Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    -   If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
     >   
     >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted sales credit memo line for a new sales credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Sales Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **post** action.

## To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
You might decide to compensate a customer for an item that you have sold them by replacing the item. You can make a replacement with the same item or a different item. This situation could occur if you mistakenly shipped the wrong item to the customer, for example.  

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.
3. On the **Move Negative Sales Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line for the replacement item is deleted from the sales return order and inserted in a new **Sales Order** page. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To create return-related documents from a sales return order
You can have replacement sales orders, purchase return orders, and replacement purchase orders created automatically during the sales return process. This is useful, for example, in situations where you want to handle items with warranties provided by vendors.

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, choose the **Create Return-Related Documents** action.
2. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the number of a vendor if you want to create vendor documents automatically.
3. If a returned item must be returned to the vendor, select the **Create Purch. Ret. Order** check box.
4. If a returned item must be ordered from the vendor, select the **Create Purchase Order** check box.
5. If a replacement sales order must be created, select the **Create Sales Order** check box.

## To create a restock charge
You might decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item. This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them, for example.

You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes this for a sales return order, but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo.

1. Open the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process.
2. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
3. Fill in the fields as for any item charge line. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).  

When you post the sales return order, the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

# Configure Copilot and agent capabilities

This article explains how to control Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central. An administrator must complete these tasks.

Copilot is a system feature and an integral part of Business Central. Like most system features, you can't turn Copilot on or off. However, Business Central provides extensive transparency and control for administrators, including:

- Understand which Copilot and agent capabilities are available to your environment.
- Deactivate individual capabilities.
- Grant or deny access to individual users for each capability.
- Data governance controls.

There are different levels of access control for agent capabilities, depending on the feature:

- Allow data movement across geographical regions.

    This task is required only if your Business Central environment is in a different geography than the Azure OpenAI Service it uses. [Learn more about this task](#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

- Activate the feature on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about this task](#activate-features).

If any of these requirements aren't met, the feature isn't available for use.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, starting with update 25.0, data movement across geographies is enabled, and all features are activated. This setup means Copilot is ready to use without any configuration unless you choose to deactivate specific features.

## Prerequisites

- You use Business Central online.
- You're an [administrator](#requirements-for-being-an-administrator) in Business Central.

## Allow data movement across geographies

This section applies only if the **Allow data movement** toggle switch appears near the top of the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If the **How do I govern my copilot data?** link appears instead of the **Allow data movement** option, skip this task.

![Screenshot that shows the Allow data movement option on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/allow-data-movement-v3.png)

The presence of the **Allow data movement** toggle indicates that the location of your Business Central environment (where data is processed and stored) differs from the Azure OpenAI Service geography that Copilot uses. To enable Copilot, you must allow data movement between geographies. Learn more in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

You can choose to disallow data movement, which deactivates Copilot and all features. To allow or disallow data movement across geographies:

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. Switch the **Allow data movement** toggle on or off as desired.

After an Azure OpenAI Service becomes available in the geography of your Business Central environment, your environment is automatically connected to it. At that point, the **Allow data movement** toggle no longer appears on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.

## Activate features

Copilot and agent capabilities are active by default when they're made available in preview or become generally available. On the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, you can turn individual features off or on again for all users.

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. The page lists all available Copilot and AI-related features and their status (*Active* or *Inactive*). The features are divided into two sections: preview and generally available.

    - To turn on a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Activate**.
    - To turn off a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Deactivate**.

    [![Screenshot that shows the Activate and Deactivate buttons for the feature lists on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg)](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg#lightbox)

## Granting user access

Copilot and agent capabilities can offer functionality that is intended for any users across your organization or for specific user roles. Most Copilot and agent capabilities offer access control through permissions and permission sets in Business Central's permission management system. Learn more about permissions and permission sets in [Assign permissions to users and groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The following table lists the permissions that are required to use the Copilot features that Business Central provides.

| Copilot feature | Required permissions |
|---|---|
| Analysis assist | **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or execute permission on system object 9640 **Allow Data Analysis mode**. These permissions are the same permissions that are required to access the analysis mode. |
| Autofill | **Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9700 **Allow Copilot Autofill**. |
| Bank reconciliation assist | Permission on page 7250 **Bank Acc. Rec. AI Proposal** and page 7252 **Trans. To GL Acc. AI Proposal**. |
| Chat |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9690 **Allow Copilot Chat**. |
| Suggest substitute items| Permission on page 7410 **Item Subst. Suggestion** and page 7411 **Item Subst. Suggestion Sub**.|
| Summarize |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9680 **Allow Copilot Summary**. |
| Map e-documents | Permission on page 6166 **E-Doc. PO Copilot Prop**. |
| Marketing text suggestions | Permission on page 5836 **Copilot Marketing Text**. |
| Sales line suggestions | Permission on page 7275 **Sales Line AI Suggestions** and page 7276 **Sales Line AI Suggestions Sub**. |
|Sales Order Agent|Learn more in [Manage agent permissions and user access](sales-order-agent-setup.md#manage-agent-permissions-to-objects-data-and-ui-elements).|

To grant or deny access to specific non-Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities, consult the feature's documentation or publisher for the required permissions.

## Requirements for being an administrator

You need SUPER permission in your Business Central user account or one of the following Business Central licenses:

- Delegated Admin agent - Partner
- Delegated Helpdesk agent - Partner
- Internal Admin
- Internal BC Administrator
- Dynamics 365 Administrator

Business Central doesn't yet offer granular, object-level permissions so that only specific administrators can configure Copilot.

## Next steps

For the Sales Order Agent, there are a few more steps you must complete before the agent is ready for use. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md#configure-and-activate-sales-order-agent).

# Create Service Orders
You can use the **Service Order** page to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request.  

When creating a service order, you only have to fill in a few fields. Some fields are optional and many are automatically filled in when you fill in related fields.  

## To create a service order    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  

     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders on the **Service Management Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service order number.  

4. In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list. The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  

5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Management Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
7. Register the service item lines.  

## To create a service order from a contract  
You can automatically create service orders for the maintenance of service items based on service contracts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Contract Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Service Contract Header** FastTab, set the filters you want to apply.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields with the starting date and ending date for the period that you want to create contract service orders for. The batch job creates service orders that include service items in service contracts with next planned service dates within this period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There is a limit to the number of days you can use as the date range each time you use this batch job. You set this limit in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field on the **Service Management Setup** page.  

4. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Service Order**.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You will not be able to create order with multiple service item, if you set **One Service Item Line/Order** field on the **Service Management Setup** page. 

## To convert a service quote to a service order
When a customer has accepted a service quote, you convert it to a service order. The quote is deleted and a new service order is set up with the same description as the service quote. The response date and time are recalculated for the service order and the status is set to **Pending**. The repair status of the service items in the order are changed to **Initial**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for allocation entries for all the service items in the service quote that have the status **Active**. If it finds such allocation entries, their allocation status is updated to **Reallocation Needed**. When you reallocate the service items in the service order, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote are updated to **Finished**.   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service quote to convert to a service order.  
3. Choose the **Make Order** action.  

## To check item availability for one or more orders  
You can check and see if an item you need to fulfill an order is in stock, and if it is not, when the item will be in stock. In addition, if an item is available to reserve, you can reserve it to make sure it is available for your use. You can check availability for a particular order, or for all orders.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following:  

    * For a particular order, choose the order, and then choose the **Demand Overview** action.  
    * For all orders, choose **Show Document**. The **Service Order** page opens.  

3. On the **Demand Overview** page, expand the item grouping, and view information about the availability of the item. For example, you can see how many items are in inventory. You can also see if and when an item will be available if it is on back order, that is, Source Type = Purchase, or whether it has been reserved.

## To reserve an item for a service order
If you need to be sure that an item is available for a service order, you can reserve the item.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. On the **Service Lines** page, choose the item to reserve, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. On the **Reservation** page, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.

## To insert lines based on standard service codes  
If you have set up standard service codes and assigned them to service item groups, you can insert the standard lines linked to the standard service codes on service documents. For more information, see [Set Up Standard Service Codes](service-how-setup-service-coding.md).   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary..  
4. Fill in the service item lines with the required information.  
5. Choose the line with the service item that you want to create service lines for, and then choose **Get Std. Service Codes**. The **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page opens with the standard codes for the service item group specified on the line.  
6. Choose the appropriate code, and choose the **OK** button to enter standard service lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **Service Item Group Code** field on the service item line of the document is blank, this means that the service item does not belong to any service item group. In this case, the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page will contain a list of all standard service codes. You should select from the list to insert standard service lines in the document. You may also select from the list of standard service codes assigned to a specific service item group. To view the list, select the relevant code in the **Service Item Group Code** field on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page.  

## To register internal or public comments
You can add comments that will be printed on service orders and service quotes to provide additional information. You can add up to 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, choose another line. To register a comment, choose a line, and then choose the **Comments** action.  

## To delete invoiced service orders  
Orders are usually deleted automatically after having been fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. The posted document can be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoice** page.  

Service orders are not deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order has been posted not from the service order itself, but from the **Service Invoice** page. Then you may need to delete invoiced orders that were not deleted. You can do this by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Service Orders**, and then choose the related link. The **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job request page opens.  
2. To select the orders to be deleted, you can set filters in the **No.**, **Customer No.**, and **Bill-to Customer No.** fields.  
3. Choose **OK**.

# Delete Approval Workflows

If you're certain a workflow is no longer being used, you can delete it. All workflow step instances defined in the workflow must have a **Completed** status.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you delete a workflow, all information in the workflow is lost.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

## Delete a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the workflow you want to delete.
3. Choose the **Delete** action.
4. Alternatively, open the workflow you want to delete.
5. On the **Workflow** page, choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a workflow requires it to be disabled. To disable a workflow, open it in the **Workflows** page, then turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

# Batch post production consumption

If the flushing method is **Manual**, use a consumption journal to post the components manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field on the location card to indicate that the location requires inventory pick processing, you don't need to use this batch job. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles consumption when you post the inventory pick. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  

You can also set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    Use the **Calc. Consumption** action to generate journal lines from production orders based on the actual output (the quantity of finished goods that you reported) or on the expected output (the quantity of finished goods that you expect to produce).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured the location to require warehouse pick processing, only quantities that are already picked through a warehouse activity can be entered in the **Quantity** field in the **Consumption Journal** page. It can't be a calculated quantity. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production or Assembly in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).

3. Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related inventories are reduced.

## LCY and other currencies

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-lcy-def](includes/finance-currencies-lcy-def.md)]

## Rounding currencies

To manage currencies that don't use decimals and to avoid unnecessary decimals in foreign currency, you can use two different rounding features:

- Unit-amount rounding  

- Amount rounding  

These features can operate independently or in combination. In addition, the features can operate with invoice rounding.

As opposed to the invoice rounding features, the amount rounding and unit-amount rounding features affect only amounts in foreign currency-not the corresponding amounts in LCY. These two features don't post anything to general ledger accounts. So, no general ledger account needs to be specified on posting groups or elsewhere.

### Unit-amount rounding

The unit-amount rounding feature controls how sales prices for items and resources in foreign currencies are rounded on sales and purchase lines. You must specify the rules for each currency separately, in the **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision** field in the **Currencies** list.

The unit-amount rounding feature is used automatically every time you enter an item or resource number on a sales line. If the invoice is for a customer with a currency code, the item or resource price is converted into the customer's currency. The price is rounded according to the unit-amount rounding precision for the currency.

### Amount rounding

The amount rounding feature controls how amounts in foreign currencies are rounded on general journal lines, sales lines, and purchase lines. You must specify the rules for each currency separately, in the **Amount Rounding Precision** field in the **Currencies** list.

Amounts in foreign currencies are rounded when you fill in and post general journal lines, sales lines, and purchase lines.

## Exchange rates

You can register exchange rates for each foreign currency and specify from which dates the exchange rates are valid. For example, you can enter daily exchange rates, monthly exchange rates, or quarterly exchange rates for each foreign currency.

You can retain historical exchange rates in the **Currency Exchange Rates** page for reference purposes. When you need to update exchange rates, you can use the **Update Exchange Rates** button to get the latest exchange rates from an external service provider.

## General ledger accounts

You can't link currency codes to general ledger accounts because amounts on general ledger accounts are in LCY. If you have a bank loan in USD and place deposits in a bank account in SEK, you can keep track of these accounts by setting up bank accounts in USD and SEK. With posting groups, you can link the accounts to the relevant general ledger accounts. In the general ledger, the value of the amounts is shown in LCY.

You can enter a currency code on a general journal line and post the line to a general ledger account. The relevant exchange rate is used to convert the amount to LCY before it posts to the general ledger account.

# Sandbox Environments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can easily get a safe environment where you can test, train, or troubleshoot without disturbing your company's work processes or business data. Such a non-production environment is called a *sandbox*. Isolated from production, a sandbox environment is the place to safely explore, learn, demo, develop, and test the service without the risk of affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

> [!TIP]
> Did you land on this article after you chose the name of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the top bar? Currently, you cannot change the name or the environment that way. Instead, you must ask your admin to change the name, or ask them to share the link to another environment.

Your administrator manages sandbox environments in the [administration center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  

For example, if you want to create a sandbox for benchmarking, your administrator can create a dedicated environment in the administration center. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the developer and administration content.  

You can also safely use sandboxes for training, such as for following a learning path from [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), because it's a safe environment to experiment with. If anything goes wrong, you just delete the sandbox and start over.  

Once you're done, you can remove the sandbox, using the administration center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, sandbox environments are very different from production environments. Your administrator can create a sandbox that includes production data, but it is still a sandbox, and you cannot request a database export, for example. For more information, see [Sandbox environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types#sandbox-environments) in the developer and administration content.

The sandbox environment is not least useful because it includes a couple of handy features:

* [Advanced user experience](#advanced-user-experience)  
<!--* [Complete sample data](#complete-sample-data)  -->
* [Designer](#designer)  

## Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox tenant by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: menu.  

After you have enabled the *Premium* user experience, you get access to all the standard profiles (roles) and Role Centers in the standard version. Alternatively, contact a reselling partner for a demonstration of the capabilities. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.yml#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

### Complete sample data

For situations where you need additional sample data, please talk to your reselling partner.
<!-- In the sandbox environment, you can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option so that you can take training or step through walkthroughs that require additional sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing.md).   -->

<!--#### To create a company with complete sample data in a sandbox

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create New Company**.  
3. In the **Assisted Setup for Creating a Company** page, choose **Next**.  
4. Specify a name for the new company, and then, in the **Select the data and setup to get started** field, choose **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**.  
5. Complete the rest of the assisted setup guide.  

When the assisted setup guide completes, you can start exploring the new company with the complete sample data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  -->

## Designer

In a sandbox environment, you will find the **Designer** enabled. You can activate Designer by selecting the design icon ![Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-design-icon.png) on a page, or by choosing the **Design** menu item in the ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) Settings menu.  

For more information, see [Use Designer](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inclient-designer) in the developer and admin content (in English only).

# Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The **Item Availability** page is part of the Sales Order Agent for checking item availability during the sale order taking process. This article provides a detailed overview of how the **Item Availability** page functions, including configuration and field descriptions.

![Screenshot of item availability page](media/soa-item-availability-page-clip.svg)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Overview

Admins can set up the Sales Order Agent to select only available items for sales quotes or orders. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

When this capability is turned on, the Sales Order Agent uses the **Item Availability** page to check an item's availability before adding it the quote or order. If an item isn't available, reviewers are notified by a **Request Assistance** step in the timeline for the task in **Task** tab.

![Screenshot of the Sales Order Agent task tab that shows a request for assistance step about item availability](media/soa-item-availability.png)

As a reviewer, use the **Item Availability** page to verify that items are unavailable. Decide whether to stop the task or let the agent proceed. You can't change items and quantity at this point. If you confirm the step, the agent creates an email to the customer about the unavailable items for your review.

<!--
Here's the general flow:

1. Select **Review** or the **Item Availability** link to open the **Item Availability** page.
1. Verify that the items in question are unavailable. Refer to the next section for details about how the page works.
1. When you're finished reviewing availability, return to the confirmation step in the **Tasks** tab and select **Confirm**.

The agent creates an email about the unavailable items for your review.
-->

## How to check item availability page

Before the agent calculates the availability and prices for requested items, its searches for the customer making the request, retrieves the customer's specific location, and then sets the **Customer No.** and **Location Filter** fields on the **Item Availability** page.

After setting these fields, the agent calculates the availability of each item in the request one at a time. The agent sets the **Date filter** with the customer's requested delivery date, if any, and the **Quantity Filter** to the requested quantity, currently only in the base unit of measure.

As a reviewer, these fields aren't automatically set to the values the agent used. To check availability, set the fields manually based on the customer's request.

For each item, the following fields are calculated:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|Requested Quantity Available|Indicates whether the quantity of items requested by the customer, specified by the **Quantity Filter** field, is available. If the **Quantity Filter** is less than or equal to the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)**, the item is available, and the check box is selected. If the **Quantity Filter** field is greater than item isn't available, and the check box is cleared. |
|Available Quantity (Base UOM)|Shows the projected available balance of item quantity on the date specified by the **Date Filter**. Calculated by adding the current item inventory in ledger entries to the items in scheduled receipts (inbound transactions like purchase and transfer orders). Then, subtract the items in gross requirements (outbound transactions like sales, service, and production orders). You can select the value to display the totals for item ledger entries and each receipt type. Then, you can drill down to view the source of these totals.|
|Unit of Measure Code|Shows the item's sales unit of measure code. If the field is empty, the base unit of measure is used.|
|Unit of Measure|The item's sales or base unit of measure description. Learn more in [Set Up Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).|
|Available Quantity|Shows the available quantity in base unit of measure (UOM) recalculated to the sales unit of measure.|
|Unit Price Including Discount|Shows the items' price including discount calculated for a specified customer on a specified date. Learn more in [Record special sales prices and discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).|
|Availability Level|Shows the level of the item's availability, such as ***Available** or **Out of Stock**. The value is calculated based on the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)** compared to the **Safety Stock  Quantity** specified on the item or storekeeping unit card. Learn more about safety stock in [Design Details: Balancing supply and demand](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).|

# Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the regional SEPA standards (Single Euro Payments Area) for importing SEPA bank statements (CAMT format). For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).  

 The SEPA CAMT standard itself has local variations. Therefore, you may have to modify the generic data exchange definition (represented by the **SEPA CAMT** code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page) to adapt it to a local variation of the standard. The following tables show the element-to-field mapping for tables 81, 273, and 274 in the SEPA CAMT implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

 For information about creating or adjusting a data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

## CAMT data mapping to fields in the General Journal table (81)  

|Element Path|Message Element|Data Type|Description|Negative-Sign Identifier|Field No.|Field Name|

 Elements in the **Ntry** node that are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but not mapped to any fields are stored in the **Posting Exch. Column Def** table. Users can view these elements from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, **Payment Application**, and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages by choosing the **Bank Statement Line Details** action. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In an import of CAMT bank statements, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] expects each transaction to be unique, which means that the **Transaction ID** field that comes from the *Stmt/Ntry/NtryDtls/TxDtls/Refs/EndToEndId* tag in the CAMT file, must be unique within the open bank account reconciliation. If the information is not present, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the payment. If an earlier bank reconciliation on the same bank account was posted with the same transaction ID as on the current import, the current transaction will not automatically reconcile but can still be imported.

# Average Production Times (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Average Production Times** report shows the detailed average production times for each item. The report can help you make informed decisions and optimize your production processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Average Production Times Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the average time it takes to produce each item. For example, you might want to identify the items that take the longest to produce and schedule their production process.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the production time for a particular item and the quantity produced on production orders. For example, you notice that the production time for a particular item is longer than expected. You can use the report to identify the cause of the delay and optimize the production process to increase efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Average Production Times* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

# Register new items

Items, among other products, are the basis of your business, the goods, or services that you trade in. Each item must be registered as an item card.

## To create a new item card

The following video shows how to set up an item on the Item Card page. However, you can also set up new items by copying existing ones. To learn more, go to [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

## Use item templates

To reuse settings for different types of items when you create new items, you can save items as item templates. Item templates help speed-up the process of adding new items, and increase consistency in your item data. When you register a new item, a page appears that lets you choose a template. After you choose a template, its settings are filled in for you on the item you're creating. If you only have one item template, new items always use that template. 

### Save an item card as an item template

1. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Item Template** page shows the item card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Dimensions**. The **Default Dimensions** for the selected item open showing any dimension codes that are set up for the item.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes that apply to new item cards created by using the template.
5. When you complete the new item template, choose the **OK** button.

The item template is added to the list of item templates, so that you can use it to create new item cards.

## Types of items

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory.

* **Inventory** specifies that the item is a physical unit that you manage and track in inventory.
* **Non-Inventory** are physical units that you don't manage or track in inventory.
* **Service** items are a labor time unit, typically used to register sells or purchase of services.

To learn more about these types of items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

> [!TIP]
> There are also catalog items, which are similar to non-inventory items in that they're items that you offer to customers but don't manage until you sell them. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).  

## Inventory costing

In the **Costing Method** field, you set up how the item's unit cost is calculated by making assumptions about the flow of physical items through your company. Five costing methods are available, depending on the type of item. To learn more about costing, go to [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you select **Average**, the item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. With this setting, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** page to view the transactions that were used to calculate the average cost.

## Categories, attributes, and variants

[!INCLUDE[inventory_variant](includes/inventory_variant.md)]

Learn more about variants at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).  

## Set up item substitutions

You can set up items to have replacements, such as other items that can be used in place of the original item.

> [!TIP]
> If you know your item catalog well, or only have a few items, you might want to specify the substitute items yourself. However, if you have a larger portfolio, the suggest item substitutes capability for Copilot can help. Copilot can suggest substitute items based on item attributes. To learn more about the AI capability, go to [Find item substitutions faster with Copilot](suggest-item-substitutions-copilot.md).

### To make an item substitution

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Find the relevant item, and then choose the **No.** to open the Item Card.  
3. Choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then **Substitutions** to open the **Item Substitution Entry** page.  
4. Choose the **Substitute No.** field, and then select the replacement item from the list.
5. Fill in or change other fields on the page as necessary.

When the requested quantity exceeds the quantity that is available in inventory, a message appears to inform you that substitute items exist.

> [!NOTE]  
> Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

## Prices and discounts

You can use special prices or discounts that you grant for the item based on certain criteria. For example, criteria include the customer, minimum order quantity, or ending date. You set up special prices by choosing the **Set Special Prices** or **Set Special Discounts** actions. Each row on, for example, the **Sales Prices** page represents a special price. Each column represents a criterion that must apply to grant a customer the special price that you enter in the **Unit Price** field on the **Sales Prices** page. To learn more about pricing, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Replenishment

You can specify how items are supplied:

* **Purchase Order** if you want to buy items.
* **Assembly order** or **Production order** if you produce the items in-house.

There are other settings that compliment these selections.

### Include items in bills of materials

You can structure hierarchies that have a main item with underlying component items in assembly and production bills of materials (BOM). To learn more about BOMs, go to [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

### Items used in production orders

To register items that you use in production orders, specify the replenishment system as **Prod. order** on the **Replenishment** FastTab. For more information, see [About Production Orders](production-about-production-orders.md).  

### Primary and alternate vendors

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor, you can connect those vendors to the item. Use the **Vendors** action on the **Item Card** page to open the **Item Vendor Catalog** page. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant item, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Vendors** action.  
4. Choose the **No.** field, and then select the vendor that you want to set up for the item.  
5. Optionally, fill in the remaining fields.  
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each vendor that you want to buy the item from.

The vendors appear on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, which you open from the item card, so that you can easily select an alternate vendor.

If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor additionally you can set up prices and discounts discounts.  For more information, see [Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

## Manage inventory in warehouses

When you register a new item, you see fields that are related to warehouse management, especially on the **Warehouse** FastTab. If your organization doesn't use the warehouse management capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then you can ignore those fields.  

If your organization later sets up warehouse management, we recommend that you make sure that each existing item has the right information in the various fields. This way, the warehouse processes can run as expected. The information can includes fields such as **Warehouse Class Code** or **Put-away Template Code**. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Planning

When your company uses the supply planning processes in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must fill in the relevant fields on the **Planning** FastTab. For an introduction to the planning area, see [Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md).  

For examples of how you can use the fields on the **Planning** FastTab, see [Setup Best Practices: Planning Parameters](setup-best-practices-planning-parameters.md).  

## Delete item cards

If you post a transaction for an item, you can't delete the card because the ledger entries might be needed for inventory valuation or auditing. To delete item cards with ledger entries, contact to Microsoft partner to do so through code.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Advanced Warehouse Configurations

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], receiving and putting away occurs using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method D in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In advanced warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require receiving processing in addition to put-away processing, you use the **Warehouse Receipt** page to record and post the receipt of items on multiple inbound orders. When the warehouse receipt is posted, one or more warehouse put-away documents are created to instruct warehouse workers to take the received items and place them in designated places according to bin setup or in other bins. The specific placement of the items is recorded when the warehouse put-away is registered. The inbound source document can be a purchase order, sales return order, inbound transfer order, or assembly or production order with output that is ready to be put away. If the receipt is created from an inbound order, more than one inbound source document can be retrieved for the receipt. By using this method you can register many items arriving from different inbound orders with one receipt.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

-   Setting up WHITE location for receiving and putting away.  
-   Creating and releasing two purchase orders for full warehouse handling.  
-   Creating and posting a warehouse receipt document for multiple purchase order lines from specific vendors.  
-   Registering a warehouse put-away for the received items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Warehouse Manager  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Receiving Staff  
-   Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

-   CRONUS installed.  
-   To make yourself a warehouse employee at WHITE location by following these steps:  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Users** page.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select the **Default** field.  

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, creates two purchase orders for accessory items from vendors 10000 and 20000 to be delivered to WHITE warehouse. When the deliveries arrive at the warehouse, Sammy, who is responsible for receiving items from vendors 10000 and 20000, uses a filter to create receipt lines for purchase orders arriving from the two vendors. Sammy posts the items as received into inventory in one warehouse receipt and makes the items available for sale or other demand. John, the warehouse worker, takes the items from the receiving bin and puts them away. John puts all units away in their default bins, except 40 out of 100 received hinges are put away in the assembly department by splitting the put-away line. When John registers the put-away, the bin contents are updated and the items are made available for picking from the warehouse.  

## Reviewing the WHITE Location Setup

The setup of the **Location Card** page defines the company's warehouse flows.  

### To review the location setup  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the WHITE location card.  
3.  Note on the **Warehouse** FastTab that the **Directed Put-away and Pick** check box is selected.  

    This means that the location is set up for the highest complexity level, reflected by the fact that all warehouse handling check boxes on the FastTab are selected.  

4.  Note on the **Bins** FastTab that bins are specified in the **Receipt Bin Code** and the **Shipment Bin Code** fields.  

This means that when you create a warehouse receipt, this bin code is copied to the header of the warehouse receipt document by default and to the lines of the resulting warehouse put-aways.  

## Creating the Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase orders  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70200|WHITE|100 PCS|  
    |70201|WHITE|50 PCS|  

    Proceed to notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4.  Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    Proceed to create the second purchase order.  

5.  Choose the **New** action.  
6.  Create a purchase order for vendor 20000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70100|WHITE|10 CAN|  
    |70101|WHITE|12 CAN|  

    Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    The deliveries of items from vendors 10000 and 20000 have arrived at WHITE warehouse, and Sammy starts to process the purchase receipts.  

## Receiving the Items

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, you can manage multiple inbound orders for source documents, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive the items  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select **Actions** then **Functions** then choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.  
5.  In the **Code** field, enter **ACCESSORY**.  
6.  In the **Description** field, enter **Vendors 10000 and 20000**.  
7.  Choose the **Modify** action.  
8.  On the **Purchase** FastTab, in the **Buy-from Vendor No. Filter** field, enter **10000&#124;20000**.  
9. Choose the **Run** action. The warehouse receipt is filled with four lines representing purchase order lines for the specified vendors. The **Qty. to Receive** field is filled because you did not select the **Do not Fill Qty. to Handle** check box on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page.  
10. Optionally, if you want to use a filter as described earlier in this section, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select purchase orders from the vendors in question.  
11. Choose **Posting** then the **Post Receipt** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Positive item ledger entries are created reflecting the posted purchase receipts of accessories from vendors 10000 and 20000, and the items are ready to be put away in the warehouse from the receiving bin.  

## Putting the Items Away

On the **Warehouse Put-away** page, you can manage put-aways for a specific warehouse receipt document covering multiple source documents. Like all warehouse activity documents, each item on the warehouse put-away is represented by a Take line and a Place line. In the following procedure, the bin code on the Take lines is the default receiving bin at WHITE location, W-08-0001.  


### To put the items away  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-Aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the only warehouse put-away document in the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    The warehouse put-away document opens with a total of eight Take or Place lines for the four purchase order lines.

    The warehouse worker is told that 40 hinges are needed in the assembly department, and proceeds to split the single Place line to specify a second Place line for bin W-02-0001 in the assembly department where the warehouse worker places that part of the received hinges.  

3.  Select the second line on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, the Place line for item 70200.  
4.  In the **Qty. to Handle** field, change the value from 100 to 60.  
5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Split Line**. A new line is inserted for item 70200 with 40 in **Qty. to Handle** field.  
6.  In the **Bin Code** field, enter W-02-0001. The **Zone Code** field is automatically filled.  

    By default, the **Zone Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

    Proceed to register the put-away.  

7.  Choose the **Register Put-Away** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    The received accessories are now put-away in the items' default bins, and 40 hinges are placed in the assembly department. The received items are now available for picking to internal demand, such as assembly orders, or to external demand, such as sales shipments.

# Enabling Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to get [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ready for integration with Power BI. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already enabled for integration, although there's some information about licensing that you might want to read. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have set up your environment to connect to Power BI before users can work with it.

## <a name="license"></a>Power BI Licensing

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users get a free Power BI license that provides access to the most common features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. You can also purchase a Power BI Pro license that provides access to additional features. The following table provides an overview of the features available with each license.

|Power License|View reports|Create reports|Share reports|Refresh reports| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps|
|-------------|--------||
|Power BI free|![a checkmark.](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace)  | ![another checkmark](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace) |(limited)|(limited)||
|Power BI Pro|![yet another checkmark.](media/check.png) |![it's a checkmark](media/check.png)|![again a checkmark](media/check.png)|(extensive)|![last checkmark](media/check.png)|

You can't use a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] free license for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps. To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Couple and synchronize records between Dataverse and Business Central

This article describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator creates a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

<!--## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376] -->

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account or Contact pages.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple records automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. To learn more, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. To learn more, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have many Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

Use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel.
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.

# Scheduled Receipt (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Scheduled Receipt** report shows inbound inventory for items or item categories for different types of documents types or processes. The information also includes internal assembly or production accounting for when the finished good becomes available along with purchase and sales return documents.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/scheduled-receipt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Scheduled Receipt Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/scheduled-receipt.png":::

## Use the report

Managers and warehousing staff use the report to know when to expect to receive inventory.

Managers use the report to track inventory levels and ensure that stock levels keep up with the requirements shown in the [Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) report. Use this information to optimize your inventory and ensure you aren't over buying or over producing a specific item.

For warehouse receipt workers, this report offers detailed information about inbound stock from internal and external sources. This information can help you coordinate future purchasing and production levels.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Scheduled Receipt* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Scheduled Receipt**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#scheduled-receipt)

# Assemble Items

If the **Replenishment System** field on the item card contains **Assembly**, the default method of supplying the item is to assemble it according to an assembly BOM, and potentially by a specific resource. Learn more at [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). Learn more about how to set up an assembly item at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

You can set up assembly items for two assembly processes.

|Process  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assemble to stock     | Items that you assemble and stock for future sales. For example, kits for an upcoming sales campaign. The items aren't related to a sales order, at least not yet. Typically, these items aren't customized for customer requests.        |
|Assemble to order     | Items that you don't want to stock. For example, because they're customized based on customer orders or to reduce the cost of on-hand inventory. |
  
This article describes the standard settings for assemble to stock. There might be other ways that are more suited for your business though. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md) and [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Assembly components are handled in a special way in basic warehouse configurations. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

## To assemble an item to stock

Follow the steps in this procedure to assemble an item to stock. To learn about assemble to order, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **New Assembly Order** page opens.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Item No.** field, select the item that you want to assemble. You can select items that are set up for assembly and have an assembly BOM, or items without an assembly BOM. The latter is useful for unplanned assemblies or scenarios when you want to use item reclassification and track costs.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the item that you want assembled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components are not available to fulfill quantity on the due date, the **Assembly Availability** page opens. The page shows how many assembly items can be assembled based on component availability. Learn more at [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md). When you close the page, the assembly order is created with availability alerts on the lines for the affected components.  

    The lines contain the contents of the assembly BOM and the specified quantities.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Assembly Availability** page opened when you filled in the assembly order header, each affected assembly order line contains a **Yes** in the **Avail. Warning** field with a link to detailed availability information. <!--check whether this field help is useful For more information, see Check Availability.--> You can resolve a component availability issue by:

    > * Postponing the starting date.
    > * Replacing the component with another item.
    > * Selecting an available substitution if one is defined.  

6. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, enter how many units of the assembly item that you want to post as output the next time you post the assembly order. This quantity can be lower than the value in the **Quantity** field to reflect a partial output posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To make sure that component consumption posting matches the assembly item output posting, the quantity fields in the assembly order lines automatically adjust to the value that you enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field.  
7. On assembly order lines of type **Item** or **Resource**, in the **Quantity to Consume** field, specify how many units you want to post as consumed the next time that you post the assembly order.
8. When you are ready to partially or fully post, choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If warnings are still present in the assembly order lines, you can't post the order. A message displays the component or components that are not in inventory.  

After posting succeeds, the assembly item is posted as output to the location code and potential bin code that are defined on the assembly order. For manually created assembly orders, the location may be copied from the **Default Location for Orders** setup field. For assemble-to-order flows, the location code may be copied from the sales order line.

# Run and print reports in Business Central

Reports help you collect and display data based on specific criteria. It organizes and presents the information in an easy-to-read format you can print or save as a file. There are many reports you can access throughout the application. The reports typically provide information related to the context of the page you're on. For example, the **Customer** page includes reports for the top 10 customers, sales statistics, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Batch jobs and XMLports do more or less the same as reports, but are used more to process or export data. For example, the **Create Reminders** batch job creates reminder documents to send to customers with overdue payments. This article refers mainly to "reports", but similar information applies to batch jobs and XMLports.

## Get started

You can find reports in the **Reports** menu on selected pages, lists, and cards. You can also use the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") to find reports by name. For an overview of built-in reports, you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], sorted by categories, see [Available Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](reports-available-reports.md).

When you choose a report, you see a request page titled after the report's name where you set various options and filters that determine what data is included. The following sections explain how to use the request page to build, preview, and print a report.

## <a name="SavedSettings"></a>Use default values&mdash;predefined settings

Most report request pages include the **Use default values from** field. With this field, you can select predefined settings for the report, which automatically set options and filters. Select an entry from the dropdown list to see the options and filters on the report request page change accordingly.

The entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use the options and filters you used the last time you ran the report.

The **Use default values from** field provides a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. After you select an entry, you can change any of the options and filters before you preview or print the report. The changes you make won't be saved to the predefined settings entry you selected, but they'll be saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

> [!NOTE]
> The predefined settings are typically set up and managed by an administrator. Learn more in [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

## Specify the data to include in a report

Use the fields under **Options** and **Filters** to change or limit the information you want in the report. You can set filters in a report in more or less the same way as you set filters on lists. Learn more in the [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Filter** FastTab on a report request page provides a generic filtering capability for reports. These filters are optional.
>
> Some reports ignore any such filters, which means no matter what filter is set in the **Filter** FastTab, the output of the report is the same. It's not possible to provide a list of which fields are ignored in which reports, so you'll have to experiment with the filters when using them.
>
> **Example**: When you use the **Create Reminders** batch job, a filter for the **Customer Ledger Entries** field of **Last Issued Reminder Level** is ignored because filters are fixed for that batch job.

## Preview a report

By previewing a report, you can see what the report looks like before you print it. The preview isn't based on the printer selected in the **Printer** field on the request page. It's controlled by the browser. After previewing, you can then go back to the request page and make changes to options and filters as you need.

The preview choices on the **Report Request** page depend on the report. So, for some reports, you can select **Preview**, while for others, the choice is **Preview & Close**. Both choices open a preview of the report. The difference is that **Preview** keeps the request page open, so you can go back to it, make changes, preview again, or print. In contrast, with **Preview & Close** the request page closes, and you have to open the report again to make changes or print.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2020 release wave 1 or earlier, the only choice is **Preview**, which closes the request page on preview, as described for **Preview & Close**.

### Work with the preview

In the preview, use the menu bar on the report preview to:

- Move through pages
- Zoom in and out
- Resize to fit the page
- Select text
  
  You can copy text from a report, then paste it somewhere else, such as a page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Microsoft Word. Using a mouse, for example, select the left mouse button and hold where you want to start. Slide the mouse to select one or more words, sentences, or paragraphs. Then select the right mouse button and select **Copy**. You can now paste the selected text where you want it.

- Pan the document
  
  You can move the visible area of the report in any direction to view other areas of the report. Panning is helpful when you zoom in to see details. Using your mouse, for example, select and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the report preview, and then move your mouse to select a section of the report.

- Download to a PDF file on your computer or network.
- Print

## Save a report to a file

You can save a report to a PDF document, Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel workbook, or XML document by choosing **Send to**, then making your selection. A file is downloaded to your computer.

If your organization configured OneDrive for system features, instead of being downloaded, Excel workbooks and Word documents are opened in your browser using either Excel or Word for the web.

> [!TIP]
> The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** and **XML Document** options are mostly for advanced purposes. You'd typically use these options to do detailed data analysis. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel and XML](report-analyze-excel.md).
>
> You can also use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** to create new Excel layouts for a given report. Learn more at [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).  

## <a name="ScheduleReport"></a> Schedule a report to run later or periodically

You can schedule a single or recurring report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. Select the **Schedule** option after selecting **Send to**, then enter information, such as the printer, and time and date. The report is added to the job queue and runs at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item is removed from the job queue. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

When you schedule a report to run, you can specify, for example, that it must run every Thursday by setting the **Next Run Date Formula** field to *D4*. Learn more in the [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas) section.  

You can save the report to a file (such as Excel, Word, or PDF), print it, or only generate the report. If you save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** page on your Role Center for you to view it. Learn more at [Share and Export Reports with the Report Inbox](ui-work-report-inbox.md)

### Manage scheduled recurring reports

Batch jobs generate scheduled reports managed on the **Job Queue Entries** page. You can see each report's status and other information on the page, pause/resume the report batch job, and generate the report on demand.

From the **Job Queue Entries** page, you can also change some report parameters, such as the output file type, recurrence, run date, and starting and ending times. Before you edit an existing scheduled report, however, it's necessary to put the report job queue on hold:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, then select the related link.  
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select the desired report.
3. Select the **Set On Hold** action.
4. Open and edit the scheduled report by selecting its status (*On Hold*).

After you edit the report options, repeat the first two steps and then select the **Set Status to Ready** action to resume generating the report.

Learn more about job queue management at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## <a name="PrintReport"></a>Print a report

To print a report, select **Print** on the report request page or on the menu bar of the **Preview** page.

When a report uses an Excel layout, you don't have the **Printer** field or **Print** or **Preview** buttons. Instead, there's a **Download** option. To print, select **Download**, then open the downloaded file in Excel and print from there.

### <a name="Printer"></a>Printer

The **Printer** field on the request page shows the name of printer the report is sent to. To change a printer, just select the printer from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The **(Handled by the browser)** option indicates there's no designated printer for the report. In this case, the browser handles the printout and displays the standard printing steps, where you can choose a local printer connected to your computer. The **(Handled by the browser)** option isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app or app for Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> The printer selected for you by default is set up on the **Printer Selections** page. Learn more about how you can change the default printer in the [Set up default printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md#default) section.

### Print reports in Thai

Specifically for the Thai version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the **Print** button can't print reports correctly because of limitations in the service that generates the printable PDF file. Instead, you can open the report in Word and then save the report as a printable PDF.  

Or, you can ask your administrator to create a Word report layout for your most used reports. Learn more at [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

## Switch the report layout

A report layout controls what is shown on a report, how it's arranged, and how it's styled. There are a few ways to change the layout:

- When you're setting up to run a report, you'll see the current layout in the **Report Layout** field on the request page. To temporarily switch to a different layout, select the **Report Layout** field, then select from a list of available layouts for the report.
- To change the default layout used by a report, go to either the **Report Layouts** or **Report Layout Selection** pages.

Learn more at [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md). Or, if you want to customize your own report layout, see [Get Started Creating Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

## Change language and format of numbers, dates, and times

By default, the language of text and format of numbers, dates, and times in a report are based on your working language and region settings, which are defined on the **My Settings** page. You can, however, change the language and format region on a case-by-case basis when you preview, print, or send a report. On the request page, set the **Language** and **Format Region** options to your preference. You can also specify the language and region format to use by default for customers and vendors on their card pages.

Depending on where you've specified the language and format settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] determines the settings to use in the following order:

1. The settings you specify when you generate a report.
2. The settings specified on the document, which come from the customer or vendor's settings.
3. The settings specified on the Report AL object.
4. The settings defined in My Settings.

For more information about the **My Settings** page, see [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

## Advanced options

The fields under the **Advanced** FastTab set limitations on the generated report to control printer resources. You typically won't have to change these settings, unless you have a large report. If a report exceeds these limitations when you try to preview or print, a message indicates which limitation you've exceeded. You can then change the settings to suit your report. Each field, however, has a maximum value you should be aware of:

|Field|Maximum value|
|-----|-------------|
|Maximum rendering time|12:00:00|
|Maximum rows|1000000|

## Get help for a report

You can get help using a report in two ways: teaching tips and help pane.

### Teaching tip for a report

Many reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a teaching tip to increase your chance of success with the report. The title and description of these teaching tips try to answer the following hypothetical questions:

- What is this report about?
- What can I do with this report?

With teaching tips, the report creator helps you understand the logic relevant to the report, allowing you to start your reporting task immediately without being blocked. After you dismiss a teaching tip, you can select or hover over the report title on the request page to reopen the teaching tip.

Learn more in [In-product tips](product-help-and-support.md#in-product-tips)

### Help pane for a report

When the report request page is open, select the **Help** question mark in the top-right corner of the role center to open the help pane. Here, you find the teaching tip text (if defined on the report). You also find relevant links to documentation articles that explain related topics in more depth.

Learn more in [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane)

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the **Customer** card for whom you will assign a base calendar.  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Base Calendar Code** field, select the base calendar that you want to assign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  -   If you do not assign a base calendar to a company, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   If you enter a blank location on an order line, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can make customized calendar entries, you must first assign a base calendar to the company.

# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

Starting in 2025 release wave 1 (update 26.0), admins can control precisely who has access to Chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).

## Can Copilot answer questions about any records? 

When you chat with Copilot about records and pages, Copilot searches your company data within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on your behalf and can only access the data you have permission to access. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s extensive security, privacy, and compliance controls also apply to Copilot. For example, you can't ask Copilot to show masked or secret fields or retrieve records controlled by record-level security.

## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)].

## In which countries or regions can I chat with Copilot?

Starting in update 25.4, chat is available in all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] countries and regions. If you're unable to access the chat pane, find the answer in [What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?](#what-can-i-do-if-the-chat-pane-doesnt-show)

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

As of January 2025, chat is available no matter which language you use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Does chat work with my customizations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- If you ask questions to find records, it can find records in your custom tables that use custom fields.
- If you ask Copilot for an explanation or guidance, it doesn't have access to any information about your customizations or documentation for your add-ons.

Learn how to improve Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## How does Copilot locate records? 

When you ask to find a single record, multiple records, or a field from a record, Copilot uses various mechanisms to search for this information. Copilot generates the appropriate sorting and filtering on list pages and their corresponding source tables. It uses the fields on the page and fields on the underlying tables as part of these operations and in its responses.

## Does Copilot have access to all fields on a table? 

No. Copilot has access to most but not all fields when finding records. For example, it excludes fields that might contain passwords or other secrets. Learn which field data types are excluded in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

Similarly, when you ask Copilot to show a specific field from a record, some fields are excluded and might not be part of Copilot’s response. For example, if your admin hasn't given you permission to personalize Business Central, Copilot shows only the fields typically displayed by default on the list pages.

## How do I open a record or page from chat?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it shows any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## Why do I get different answers from Copilot for the same question?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't always identical.

## How do I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## Can I customize or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified directly through customization, add-ins, tools, or personalization. 
Learn about how to influence Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## Does Copilot search for data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into. It doesn't search for data across multiple environments or companies.

## How does chat treat data residency? 

The chat feature relies on Azure OpenAI Service for AI and Microsoft Learn for online documentation. Learn more about data residency and Azure OpenAI Service in [Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data](azure-openai-data.md) and [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

Microsoft Learn online service endpoints are available in the US, Switzerland, and Europe Azure geographies. For EU customers, this means their data never leaves the EU Data Boundary, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always connects to endpoints in Switzerland or Europe Azure geographies.

If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is deployed to any other Azure geography, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Microsoft Learn online service outside your environment's geographic region or compliance boundary. When you use chat to ask for explanations on how to do things in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], only a few search keywords derived from your message to Copilot are sent to the Microsoft Learn online service in a different Azure geography. They're processed and not stored for more than one day.

To prevent chat from connecting to the Microsoft Learn online service, deactivate the chat feature using the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features).

## What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?

- Make sure your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is version 25.4 or later.
- For Business Central versions 25.4 to 25.5, make sure the entry for "Chat with Copilot" is enabled for all users in the **Feature Management** page.
- Make sure you have permission to chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).
- For Business Central version 26 and later, make sure **Chat** is active in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. In some countries and regions, Chat with Copilot isn't active by default. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## How is Microsoft improving chat with Copilot?

We're continually working on improving reliability and response time. We announced the next expansion of chat where Copilot can answer questions about how to use installed add-on apps. Learn more in [Chat with Copilot to learn how to use installed add-on apps](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/chat-copilot-learn-use-installed-add-on-apps).

We encourage administrators to try out experimental features on sandbox environments. To experience the latest improvements to chat, enable the **Feature: Enables advanced navigation (not data) search capabilities by utilizing semantic similarity search on application metadata.** key on the **Feature Management** page. This feature uses superior AI technology to match user inquiries with the names of pages, fields, and tables. Learn more in [Use semantic search to find pages and reports with Copilot chat](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/semantic-search-feature-key).

We look forward to getting your feedback about how Copilot can provide better assistance to your workday.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to find records, the way you phrase the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers concise, the chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds more relevant records.

## Why does Copilot give incorrect answers to calculations?

While in preview, chat with Copilot can help you find records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and start speaking. Learn more at [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).

# Validate VAT Registration Numbers

It is important that the VAT registration numbers you have for customers, vendors, and contacts are valid, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a country/region that uses VAT. For example, companies sometimes change their tax liability status, and in some countries/regions tax authorities might ask you to provide reports, such as the **EC Sales List** report, that list the VAT registration numbers you use when you do business.

The European Commission provides the VIES VAT Number Validation service on its website, which is public and free. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can save you a step and let you use the VIES service to validate and track VAT numbers and other company information for customers, vendors, and contacts. The service in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is named **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**. The service is available on the **Service Connections** page, and you can start using it right away. The service connection is free, and additional sign up is not required.

## Configure the service to verify VAT registration numbers automatically

To enable the **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**, open the entry in the **Service Connection** page. If the **Service Endpoint** field is not already filled in, use the **Set Default Endpoint** action. Then set the **Enabled** field, and you are good to go.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable the validation service, you must have administrator permissions.

Optionally, set up templates for the types of VAT-related data that you want the service to also check. For more information, see the [Validation templates](#validation-templates) section.

When you use our service connection, we record a history of VAT numbers and verifications for each customer, vendor, or contact, in the **VAT Registration Log**, so you can easily track them. The log is specific to each customer. For example, the log is useful for proving that you have verified that the current VAT number is correct. When you verify a VAT number, the **Request Identifier** column in the log will reflect that you have taken action.

You can view the VAT Registration log on the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, by choosing the lookup button in the **VAT Registration No.** field.  

There are a couple of things to note about the VIES VAT Number Validation service:

* The service uses the http protocol, which means that data transferred through the service is not encrypted.  
* You may experience downtime for this service for which Microsoft is not responsible. The service is part of a broad EU network of national VAT registers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to check that the data is valid. On occasion, data with errors is returned by the VIES VAT Number Validation service. If validation fails, validate the VAT registration numbers on the [web site](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/), print the result or save it to a shared location, and then add the link to the record for your customer, vendor, or contact. For more information, see [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

## Validation templates

You can use the VIES service to also check other company information, such as the address, as well as the VAT registration number. In the **VAT Reg. No. Validation Templates** page, create an entry for each country/region that you want to get further validation for, and then specify the information that you want to get validated automatically.  

For example, add an entry for Spain where you want to get validation for name, street, city, and post code, and then another entry for Germany where you just want validation for post code, for example. Then, in the **EU VAT Registration No. Validation Service Setup** page, specify the default template.  

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure that the default template works for your needs. You can change the default to match your requirements, such as get validation for all fields or no fields.

The next time that you specify a VAT registration number, the service validates the number and any additional data as determined by your validation templates. If the specified values are different from the values that are returned by the service, you will see the details in the **Validation Details** page where you can accept or reset the values.

title: How to Add Fields to a Word Report Layout
description: This topic describes how to add fields of a report dataset to an existing Word report layout for a report.

# Work with Word Layouts

A Word report layout determines the content and format of a report when it is previewed and printed from Business Central. You create and modify these layouts using Microsoft Word.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout.png)](media/word-layout.png#lightbox) 

When you modify a Word report layout, you specify the fields of the report dataset to include on report and how the fields are arranged. You also define the general format of the report, such as text font and size, margins, and background images. You will typically arrange the content of the report by adding tables to the layout.

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word, like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

## Embedding Fonts in Word Layouts for Consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

## Adding data fields

A report dataset can consist of fields that display labels, data, and images. This topic describes the procedure for adding fields of a report dataset to an existing Word report layout for a report. You add fields by using the Word custom XML part for the report and adding content controls that map to the fields of the report dataset. Adding fields requires that you have some knowledge of the report's dataset so that you can identify the fields that you want to add to the layout.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot modify built-in report layouts<!--Onprem. Built-in layouts can only be modified by using the development environment-->.  

###  <a name="OpenXMLPart"></a> To open the Custom XML part for the Report in Word  
  
1. If it's not already open, then open the Word report layout document in Word.  
  
     For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  
  
2. Display the **Developer** tab in the ribbon of Microsoft Word.  
  
     By default, the **Developer** tab is not shown in the ribbon. Learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon).  
  
3. On the **Developer** tab, select **XML Mapping Pane**.  
  
4. In the **XML Mapping** pane, in the **Custom XML Part** dropdown list, choose the custom XML part for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report, which is typically last in the list. The name of the custom XML part has the following format:  
  
     `urn:microsoft-dynamics-nav/reports/<report_name>/<ID>`  

     `<report_name>` is the name that is assigned to the report 

     `<ID>` is the identification number of the report.  
  
     After you select the custom XML part, the XML Mapping pane displays the labels and field controls that are available for the report.  
  
### To add a label or data field  
  
1. Place your cursor in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You cannot add a field by manually typing the dataset field name in the content control. You must use the **XML Mapping** pane to map the fields.  
  
### To add repeating rows of data fields to create a list  
  
1. In a table, add a table row that includes a column for each field that you want repeated.  
  
   This row will act as a placeholder for the repeating fields.  
  
2. Select the entire row.  
  
3. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that corresponds to the report data item that contains the fields that you want repeated, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Repeating**.  
  
4. Add the repeating fields to the row as follows:  
  
    1. Place your pointer in a column.  
  
    2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    3. For each field, repeat steps a and b.  
  
## Adding image fields

A report dataset can include a field that contains an image, such as a company logo or a picture of an item. To add an image from the report dataset, you insert a **Picture** content control.  
  
Images align in the top-left corner of the content control and resize automatically in proportion to fit the boundary of the content control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can only add images that have a format that is supported by Word, such as .bmp, .jpeg, and .png file types. If you add an image that has a format that is not supported by Word, you will get an error when you run the report from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.  
  
### To add an image  
  
1. Place your pointer in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Picture**.  
  
3. To increase or decrease the image size, drag a sizing handle away from or towards the center of the content control.  

##  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields

Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field that you want to delete, and then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.

## Custom XML Part Overview

Word report layouts are built on *custom XML parts*. A custom XML part for a report consists of elements that correspond to the data items, columns, and labels that comprise the report's dataset. <!--OnPrem The data as defined in the Report Dataset Designer in Microsoft Dynamics NAV Development Environment. -->The custom XML part is used to map the data into a report when the report is run.

### XML structure of custom XML part

The following table provides a simplified overview of the XML of a custom XML part.  
  
|XML Elements|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>`|Header|  
|`<WordReportXmlPart xmlns="urn:microsoft-dynamics-365/report/<reportname>/<id>/"`|XML namespace specification. `<reportname>` is the name that is assigned to the report. `<id>` is the ID that is assigned to the report.|  
|`..<Labels>`<br /><br /> `....<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<br /><br /> `....<LabelName>LabelCaption</LabelName>`<br /><br /> `..</Labels>`|Contains all the labels for the report.<!--OnPren The element includes labels that are related to columns that have the IncludeCaption Property.--><br />-   Label elements that are related to columns have the format `<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<!--OnPrem where `ColumnName` is determined by the column's Name Property.-->.<br />-  Label elements have the format `<LabelName>LabelName</LabelName`<!--OnPrem where LabelName is determined by the label's Name Property.-->.<br />-   Labels are listed in alphabetical order.|  
|`..<DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem1Column1>DataItem1Column1</DataItem1Column1>`|Top-level data item and columns. Columns are listed in alphabetical order.<!--OnPrem <br /><br /> The element names and values are determined by the Name Property of the data item or column.-->|  
|`....<DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem2Column1>DataItem2Column1</DataItem2Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem3>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem3Column1>DataItem3Column1</DataItem3Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem3>`|Data items and columns that are nested in the top-level data item. Columns are listed in alphabetical order under the respective data item.|  
|`..</DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `</WordReportXmlPart>`|Closing element.|  
  
### Custom XML part in Word

 In Word, you open the custom XML part in the **XML Mapping** pane, and then use the pane to map elements to content controls in the Word document. The **XML Mapping** pane is accessible from the **Developer** tab (learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon)).  
  
 The elements in the **XML Mapping** pane appear in a structure that is similar to the XML source. Label fields are grouped under a common **Labels** element and data item and columns are arranged in a hierarchal structure that corresponds to the XML source, with columns listed in alphabetical order. Elements are identified by their column name as defined in the report's dataset in AL code. Learn more in [Defining a Report Dataset](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-dataset).  
  
 The following figure illustrates the simple custom XML part from the previous section in the **XML Mapping** pane of a Word document.  
  
 ![Clip of the XML Mapping pane in word.](media/nav_reportlayout_xmlmappingpane.png "NAV_ReportLayout_XMLMappingPane")  
  
* To add a label or field to the layout, you insert a content control that maps to the element in the **XML Mapping** pane.  
  
* To create repeating rows of columns, insert a **Repeating** content control for the parent data item element, and then add content control for the columns.  
  
* For labels, the actual text that appears in the generated report is the value of the **Caption** property for the field in the data item table (if the label is related to the column in the report dataset) or a label in the Report Label Designer (if the label is not related to a column in the dataset).  
  
* The language of the label that is displayed when you run the report depends on the language setting of the report object.

# Design Details: Assembly Order Posting
Assembly order posting is based on the same principles as when posting the similar activities of sales orders and production consumption/output. However, the principles are combined in that assembly orders have their own posting UI, like that for sales orders, while the actual entry posting happens in the background as direct item and resource journal postings, like that for production consumption, output, and capacity.  

Similarly to production order posting, the consumed components and the used resources are converted and output as the assembly item when the assembly order is posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.  

The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting:  

-   The item journal posts positive item ledger entries, representing output of the assembly item, from the assembly order header  
-   The item journal posts negative item ledger entries, representing consumption of assembly components, from the assembly order lines.  
-   The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources (time units), from the assembly order lines.  
-   The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage, from the assembly order lines.  

The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting.  

![Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_1.png "Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly.  

The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting:  

![Assembly-related entry flow during posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_2.png "AAssembly-related entry flow during posting")  

## Posting Sequence  
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order:  

1.  The assembly order lines are posted.  
2.  The assembly order header is posted.  

The following table outlines the sequence of actions.  

|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Initialize Posting|1.  Make preliminary checks.<br />2.  Add posting number and modify the assembly order header.<br />3.  Release the assembly order.|  
|Post|<ol><li>Create the posted assembly order header.</li><li>Copy comment lines.</li><li>Post assembly order lines (consumption):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Create a status page to calculate assembly consumption.</li><li>Get the remaining quantity on which the item journal line will be based.</li><li>Reset the consumed and remaining quantities.</li><li>For assembly order lines of type Item:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li></ol></li><li>For assembly order lines of type Resource:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line. This creates capacity ledger entries.</li><li>Create and post resource journal line.</li></ol></li><li>Transfer field values from the assembly order line into a newly created posted assembly order line.</li></ol></li><li>Post the assembly order header (output):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li><li>Reset the assembly quantities and remaining quantities.</li></ol></li></ol>|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unlike for production output, which is posted at expected cost, assembly output is posted at actual cost.  

## Cost Adjustment  
 Once an assembly order is posted, meaning that components (material) and resources are assembled into a new item, then it should be possible to determine the actual cost of that assembly item, and the actual inventory cost of the components involved. This is achieved by forwarding costs from the posted entries of the source (the components and resources) to the posted entries of the destination (the assembly item). The forwarding of costs is done by calculating and generating new entries, called adjustment entries that become associated with the destination entries.  

 The assembly costs to be forwarded are detected with the Order Level detection mechanism. For information about other adjustment detection mechanisms, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).  

### Detecting the Adjustment  
The order Level detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

-   Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
-   Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted.  

![Assembly-related entry flow during cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Assembly-related entry flow during posting")  

### Performing the Adjustment  
The spreading of detected adjustments from material and resource costs onto the assembly output entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job. It contains the Make Multilevel Adjustment function, which consists of the following two elements:  

-   Make Assembly Order Adjustment – which forwards cost from material and resource usage to the assembly output entry. Lines 5 and 6 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  
-   Make Single Level Adjustments – which forwards costs for individual items using their costing method. Lines 9 and 10 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  

![Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_4.jpg "Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Make WIP Adjustments element, in lines 7 and 8, is responsible for forwarding production material and capacity usage to the output of unfinished production orders. This is not used when adjusting assembly order costs as the concept of WIP does not apply to assembly.  

For information about how costs from assembly and production are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Assembly Costs are Always Actual  
 The concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly order posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

This is enabled by the following data structure.  

-   In the **Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Resource* is used to identify assembly resource entries.  
-   In the **Item Ledger Entry Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Assembly Output* and *Assembly Consumption* are used to identify the output assembly item entries and the consumed assembly component entries respectively.  

In addition, posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows.  

|Entity|Type|Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|  
|Assembly Order Header|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Resource||Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  

Accordingly, only actual costs are posted to the general ledger, and no interim accounts are populated from assembly order posting. For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md)  

## Assemble to Order  
The item ledger entry that results from posting an assemble-to-order sale is fixed applied to the related item ledger entry for the assembly output. Accordingly, the cost of an assemble-to-order sale is derived from the assembly order that it was linked to.  

Item ledger entries of type Sale that result from posting assemble-to-order quantities are marked with **Yes** in the **Assemble to Order** field.  

Posting sales order lines where a part is inventory quantity and another part is assemble-to-order quantity results in separate item ledger entries, one for the inventory quantity and one for the assemble-to-order quantity.  

### Posting dates

In general, posting dates are copied from a sales order to the linked assembly order. The posting date in the assembly order is automatically updates when you change the  posting date in the sales order directly or indirectly, such as if you change the posting date in the wareshouse shippment, inventory pick, or as part of a bulk posting.

You can change the posting date in the assembly order manually. However, it can not be later then posting date in the linked sales order. The system will keep this date unless you update the posting date in the sales order.

## About chat with Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. By chatting with Copilot in Business Central, you can ask questions and find business data using natural language. Here's what you can do:

- Find business data for your company in Business Central. Use chat to look up and open data about entities or records related to business processes, such as customers, vendors, sales orders, and items. For example, ask: "Show me the latest sales order for Adatum".

  Copilot can also organize data for you. Just ask it to group records or do calculations like adding or averaging, and it generates an analysis tab, displaying the results.

- Get explanations or step-by-step guidance on various tasks. For example, ask: "Help me understand dimensions" or "How do I post a sales order". Learn more about prompting in [Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs](#prompting-for-aggregating-data-on-analysis-tabs).
- Know the purpose and use of each field. When you choose **Ask Copilot** in a tooltip for a field, chat opens with an Explain prompt for the field name and Copilot provides information about it. Copilot links to the articles it referenced, so it's easy to verify the description.
  
Using chat with Copilot streamlines your workflow by bypassing traditional navigation and product help. Watch [Work smarter with Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250609) to learn more.

Copilot's source responses are generated from the official [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central/) page.

## Prerequisites

- For Business Central update 25.3 through 25.5, Chat with Copilot feature must be enabled on the **Feature Management** page by an administrator. Learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- The **Chat** capability is activated by an administrator. Learn more in [Configuring Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Get started using chat with Copilot

1. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select the ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot](media/chat-copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** icon ![Shows cllour number 1](media/callout-number-1.svg).

   The **Copilot** pane appears as shown in the image:

    ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot pane with callouts](media/chat-with-copilot-pane.svg)

1. In the **Ask a question** box at the bottom ![Shows callout number 2](media/callout-number-2.svg), enter your question, and then select the arrowhead or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get an answer.

   Your input, known as a *prompt*, can be a question, statement, or command.

   > [!TIP]
   > Copilot includes a couple of features that can help you write questions:
   > - To help formulate questions, select one of the prompt guides&mdash;**Find**, **Explain**, or **Guide**&mdash;available at the top of the pane ![Shows callout number 3](media/callout-number-3.svg) or from the ![Shows prompt guide icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **View Prompts**  icon above **Ask a question** box ![Shows callout number 4](media/callout-number-4.svg). Prompt guides are predefined short phrases that begin a question or prompt. They save you time, guide Copilot's responses toward a category of answers, and help you learn how to phrase questions to get the best responses.
   > - Select the prompt suggestions above the **View prompts** button ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg) to automatically ask a predefined question to see how the questions and answers work. Prompt suggestions are only available when you're using the CRONUS demonstration company.

1. Review the answers displayed in the Copilot pane ![Shows callout number 6](media/callout-number-6.svg).

   The answers you receive depend on your question—it could include text, links to pages in Business Central, or helpful articles from Microsoft Learn.

   To assist you better, Chat might ask for more details about your prompt and give you a few options to choose from. In some instances, Chat follows an answer with related prompt suggestions for you to choose from ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg).

1. Ask another question to refine the answer.

   Chat remembers the context, which means that you don't have to repeat key points from the original question.

## Clear chat to start over

To switch to a different topic with Copilot, select the ![Shows the clear chat icon](media/clear-chat-icon.png) **Start a new Copilot chat session**  icon at the bottom of the Copilot pane, just above the question box. This clears Copilot's memory of your last few messages. Starting over is often helpful after a lengthy conversation and it can help Copilot deliver more accurate answers.

The chat also clears if you close or sign out of Business Central.

## Tips for better questions

### Basic techniques to improve the answers

Here are some ways you can improve the answers you get from Copilot:

- Ask clear and specific questions.
- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Ask one question at a time. <!--Avoid asking about multiple questions in one message.-->
- Use natural language, expressing the questions in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use keywords, phrases, and terms that you know are used in Business Central, either in the app or documentation.
- Ask follow-up questions or rephrase the last question if the initial response doesn't fully answer your questions.
- Clear the current chat session to start over if you're asking a question on a different subject matter than the previous question.

### Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs

If you prompt using phrases related to data aggregation, chat creates an analysis tab that you can open from a link it replies with in the Copilot pane. For example, the following figure illustrates an answer you could get for the prompt: "In which countries are my top customer?":

![Shows a link tot ana analysis tab in the chat with Copilot pane](media/chat-analysis-tab.png)

To generate this type of response, use common words and phrases related to data aggregation and analysis, like "group", "pivot", "sum", "average", "most", and "least", in different variations. For example:

`show me customers grouped by their country and zipcode`  
`which customers got most discounts`  
`group the current records by name and location`  

Learn more about analysis tabs in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md).

### Example prompts

Your questions to Copilot vary depending on your role, current task, the processes that your organization follows, and how you express yourself in words. Here are some examples to show different ways to ask questions in the chat pane to help inspire you to write your own based on your situation.

Prompt: `Find the Item with Description 'ATHENS Desk'`

In this example, you give clear instructions for Copilot to locate a single record. For example, you hint that the record is found in the Item list. You indicate the field 'Description' must be a specific text that you typed using quotes and with correct capitalization. Copilot usually responds accurately when given a few precise hints, but you can also use more casual language as in the next example.

Prompt: `Give me the latest invoice for adatum`

In this example, you ask Copilot to locate a record, but the question is less precise and might result in a less accurate answer. Copilot can often understand, or guess, that the invoice you're looking for isn't a purchase invoice but a sales invoice from the Posted Sales Invoice list. Copilot would also need to match `adatum` with `Adatum Corporation` that is the full and precise name for the sell-to Customer name associated with the invoice.

Prompt: `Show me customer ledger entries for Adatum from about three weeks ago`

In this example, you ask Copilot to solve a common date puzzle that typically requires you to open a calendar for reference, or to use advanced date range filters. Copilot can usually understand common expressions and business terms.

Prompt: `How does I save my filterrings for later?`

In this example, you ask Copilot for guidance on how to perform some task in Business Central. Copilot can usually understand the intent of your question, even if there are a few grammatical errors, spelling mistakes or abbreviations.

## Provide feedback on answers

You can rate the answers you get from Copilot by using the like (thumbs up) button for good rating or the dislike (thumbs down) button for a poor rating. When you select the dislike button, you can choose a reason, including inaccurate, inappropriate, or other. This information can help us improve suggestions.

# Planning

The production operations required to transform inputs into finished goods must be planned daily or weekly depending on the volume and nature of the products. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to supply for anticipated and actual demand from sale, assembly, and production as well as features for distribution planning using stockkeeping units and location transfers.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic mainly describes planning for companies involved in manufacturing or assembly management where the resulting supply orders can be either production, assembly, transfer, or purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Planning Worksheet** page.
>
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports supply planning for wholesale companies where the resulting supply orders can only be transfer and purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Requisition Worksheet** page, which is described indirectly in this topic as most planning functionality applies to both worksheets.

Planning can be seen as the preparation of required supply orders in the purchasing, assembly, or manufacturing departments to fulfill sales or end-item demand. For more information, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md), [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md), and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

# Set Up Warehouse Employees

You must set up each user who performs warehouse activities as a warehouse employee and assign them to a default location. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters warehouse activities to the employee's default location. They can only perform the warehouse activities at the location. You can also assign a user to other locations. They can access but not perform activities at those locations.

## To set up warehouse employees  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **User ID** field, and then select the user to be added as a warehouse employee. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, enter the code of the location where the user will be working.  
5. Turn on the **Default** toggle to specify that this is the only location where the employee can perform warehouse activities.  
6. Repeat these steps to assign other employees to locations or assign other locations to existing warehouse employees.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the **Add me as warehouse employee** action to quickly add yourself to the list of warehouse employees. For example, this is useful when you're testing the capabilities.

# Setup best practices: planning parameters

The **Planning** FastTab on the **Item Card** page is the center of a company’s supply chain. Setting the correct planning parameters is very important for cost-effective inventory control and quality customer service.  

This article provides best practices on how to set up selected planning parameter fields.

|Setup field|Best practice|Comment|  
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|Reordering Policy||To learn more, go to [Setup Best Practices: Reordering Policies](setup-best-practices-reordering-policies.md).|  
|Reserve|Select **Never** when the item is planned using a reorder point.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, select **Never** to allow the planning system to cover all demands.<br /><br /> Select **Optional** for items that you may want to reserve for top-priority customers.<br /><br /> Select **Always** for unique items (Non-Standard type of Items), such as items of type miscellaneous that are inbound for specific demands.|Reservations generally counteract the purpose of planning, which is to balance demand and supply. Therefore, items that are set up for planning should generally not be reserved.<br /><br /> If the user reserves an inventory quantity for future demand, then the planning foundation will be disturbed, and the reorder point may not work correctly. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable with regard to the reorder point, the quantities may not be available because of the reservation.|  
|Dampener Period|Set with regard to the supplier’s flexibility.<br /><br /> A shorter period enables you to reduce working capital by avoiding excessive stock, but will also cause more rescheduling actions.|If the supplier accepts last-minute changes to orders, then use a shorter period, but be prepared for more rescheduling actions. If the supplier requires firm planning, then extend the period as much as possible.<br /><br /> To learn more about this field, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).|  
|Include Inventory|Always select when you are using the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|Do not select only in special situations, such as when inventory items are not sellable.|  
|Safety Lead Time|Set between 1D and 6D. Set a safety lead time of at least one day to make sure that supplies are available on the day before they are needed. If you're using a new supplier, define a longer time until their delivery performance is known.<br /><br />In manufacturing, define longer safety lead times for critical components. Use longer safety lead times for produced components to have a buffer that allows for fluctuations in production times.|Supply that is planned by the system to avoid a stock-out will arrive on the same day that the stock-out occurs. The supply might be several hours too late if, for example, the demand is needed in the morning and the supply arrives in the afternoon. **Note:** The Safety Lead Time field uses the base calendar. Therefore, 14D is not necessarily two weeks.|  
|Safety Stock Quantity|Use for items with large demand fluctuations.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for critical components.<br /><br /> Use for items that are subject to service agreements.|If the **Reorder Point** field is not filled in, the safety stock quantity also acts as a reorder point.|  
|Lot Accumulation Period|If you want only a few big orders and it's ok to carry inventory, specify a long period for lot accumulation.<br /><br /> If you want multiple small orders and minimal inventory, set a short lot accumulation period.|The lot accumulation period is generally the longest period that you carry inventory.|  
|Reorder Point|Base the reorder point on the item’s demand profile.|If historical data shows that the item’s average demand is 100 units during a lead time of seven days, the reorder point can be set to 100 as a minimum.<br /><br /> When the inventory level falls below 100 units, the planning system suggests that you replenish because it takes seven days to supply the item, and there must be enough to cover the demand within those seven days.|  
|Time Bucket|Leave blank, meaning that the inventory level is checked every day.|Checking the inventory level every day ensures optimal reorder point planning. **Note:** A time bucket of 1W means that the inventory level can be below the reorder point for one week before a supply order is suggested.|  
|Rounding Precision|In expensive manufacturing, set to 0.00001.|Large rounding quantities of scrap or material consumption can amount to very large inventory costs. It might be relevant to set the smallest rounding precision to minimize this potential cost.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The best practices for planning parameters on item cards also apply to the same fields on SKU cards.  
>
> If you plan for demand at different locations, we recommend that you define SKUs for each location and that all demand is created by using a value in the **Location Code** field. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

# Register new vendors

Vendors provide the products you sell. Each vendor you purchase from must be registered with a vendor card.

Before you register new vendors, you must set up various purchase codes to select from when you fill in vendor cards. After all the required master data is created, you can add unique characteristics for a vendor, such as prioritize the vendor for payment purposes or list items that the vendor and other vendors supply. Another group of setup tasks for vendors is to record your agreements concerning discounts, prices, and payment methods. Learn more at [Setting Up Purchasing](purchasing-setup-purchasing.md).

Vendor cards hold the information required to buy products from each vendor. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
<br /><br />  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

## Adding new vendors

You can add new vendors manually, by filling out the **Vendor Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create templates for different types of vendor profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new vendors, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> If vendor templates exist for different vendor types, when you begin to create a new vendor card you'll see a page from which you can select the appropriate template. If only one vendor template exists, then new vendor cards always use that template.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected vendors. To create a template, fill in the information you want to reuse on the **Vendor Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the Vendor Card Page as a template](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Vendor Template** page when you create a template. For example if want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a vendor from a contact. Learn more in the [Creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

Remit-to addresses are used when you print checks to pay your vendors, and vendors can have multiple remit-to addresses for payments. For example, a vendor might supply an item from a subsidiary company, but wants to receive payment at their headquarters. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you set up multiple mailing addresses for each vendor, and you can choose the correct location to send payments to on an invoice-by-invoice basis.

You specify remit-to addresses on Vendor Card pages, and on the Shipping & Payments FastTab on purchase orders and invoices. When you create payment journal lines using the Pay Vendor or Create Payment actions on the Vendors list page or Vendor Card page, or the Apply Entries action on a payment journal, the remit-to code on the vendor ledger entry is assigned. You can overwrite this value.

### To create a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you do not know the invoicing address to be used for every invoice from a vendor, do not fill in the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab. Instead, choose the pay-to vendor number after you have set up a purchase quote, order, or invoice header.

The vendor is now registered, and the vendor card is ready to use on purchase documents.

If you want to use this vendor card as a template when you create new vendor cards, you can save it as a vendor template. Learn more in the [To save the vendor card as a template](#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

### Deleting and editing vendor information

You can edit the information on vendor cards at any time. However, if you have posted a transaction for a vendor, you cannot delete the card because the ledger entries may be needed for auditing. To delete vendor cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) on a vendor bank account without the change affecting your historical credit transfer register entries. Credit transfer register entries store the *Recipient IBAN* and the *Recipient Bank Account No.* specified in the **Vendor Bank Account** and **Recipient Name** fields from the **Vendor Card** page when the entries were created.

> [!TIP]
> You can add alternative addresses on vendor cards by choosing the **Order Addresses** action.

## To save the vendor card as a template

1. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Vendor Template** page opens showing the vendor card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the vendor.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes to apply to new vendor cards created using the template.
5. When you have completed the new vendor template, choose **OK**.  
   The vendor template is added to the list of vendor templates, so you can use it to create new vendor cards.

# FAQ for suggest item substitutions with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

In a business landscape that changes fast, companies often need to evolve the portfolio of products they sell. Whether it's adding new products, changing existing products, or adding entire product lines and categories, it's often time consuming to create and manage product (item) information.  

Reusing information from similar items can be a good option and Copilot can help you to identify similar items. An extra benefit is that suggest item substitution also reduces the risk of creating duplicated entries on the Items list page.

## What are the capabilities of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

You can store similar or interchangeable products on the **Item Substitution Entry** page. Copilot helps to add this information for current products by searching for similar ones in the database.

## What is the intended use of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

Intended to suggest item substitutions based on the description of the current item.  

Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores data doesn’t make things easier because you need to do multiple search or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

To assist you in finding items, Copilot extracts keywords, other search terms, and synonyms from the product (item) description, and uses embeddings to find similar items in the database.

## How was suggest item substitutions with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing with numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest item substitutions with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the suggest item substitutions with Copilot limitations when using the system? 

Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Suggest item substitutions only fills in the **Substitute Type**, **Substitute No.**, and **Description** fields. The **Variant Code** field isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the needed product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.  

Catalog items aren't currently supported.

The maximum number of results is currently limited to 10.

How you name your products can affect the output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For products, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|Items     | * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number        |
|Item Variants    |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>         |
|Item Reference     |* Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Attributes     |* Name<br>* Value         |
|Item Category     |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 level         |
|Item Translation     |* Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Identifier     |* Code         |
|Extend Text Line     |* Text         |

## In which geographies and languages is Suggest item substitutions available?

* Available geographies

This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for Business Central to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in item substitution page.

## What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Suggest item substitutions?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest item substitutions. Even when the feature is enabled by administrators and available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create item substitution entries? 

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert item substitution entries. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# The C5 data migration extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can also migrate historical entries for general ledger accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> The company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must not contain any data. Additionally, after you start a migration, do not create customers, vendors, items, or accounts until the migration finishes.

## What data is migrated?

The following data is migrated for each entity:

### Customers

* Contacts  
* Location
* Country
* Customer dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Shipment method
* Sales Person
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Customer price group
* Customer invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Customer posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (customer ledger entries)

### Vendors

* Contacts
* Location
* Country
* Vendor dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Invoice discount
* Shipment method
* Purchaser
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Vendor invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Vendor posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (vendor ledger entries)

### Items

* Location
* Country
* Item dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Sales line discounts
* Customer discount groups
* Item discount groups
* Sales price
* Tariff number
* Units of measure
* Item tracking code
* Customer price group
* Assembly BOMs

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Inventory posting setup
* General posting setup
* Item journal batch
* Open transactions (item ledger entries)

> [!NOTE]
> If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies, the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated. Other exchange rates are not migrated.

### Chart of accounts

* Standard dimensions: Department, Cost Center, Purpose  
* Historical G/L transactions  

> [!NOTE]
> Historical G/L transactions are treated a little differently. When you migrate data you set a **Current Period** parameter. This parameter specifies how to process G/L transactions. Transactions after this date are migrated individually. Transactions before this date are aggregated per account and migrated as a single amount. For example, let's say there are transactions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and you specify January 01, 2017 in the Current Period field. For each account, amounts for transactions on or before December 31, 2016, will be aggregated in a single general journal line for each G/L account. All transactions after this date will be migrated individually.

## File size requirements

The largest file size you can upload to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is 150 MB. If the file you export from C5 is larger than that, consider migrating data in multiple files. For example, export one or two types of entities from C5, such as customers and vendors, to a file, and then export items to another file, and so on. You can import files individually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To migrate data

There are just a few steps to export data from C5, and import it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

1. In C5, use the **Export Database** feature to export the data. Then send the export folder to a compressed (zipped) folder.  
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Migration**, and then choose **Data Migration**.  
3. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. Make sure to choose **Import from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012** as the data source.  

## Viewing the status of the migration

Use the **Data Migration Overview** page to monitor the success of the migration. The page shows information such as the number of entities that the migration includes, the status of the migration, and the number of items that have been migrated and whether they were successful. It also shows the number of errors, lets you investigate what went wrong and, when possible, makes it easy to go to the entity to fix the issues. For more information, see the next section in this article.  

> [!NOTE]
> While you are waiting for the results of the migration, you must refresh the page to display the results.

## How to avoid double-posting

To help avoid double-posting to the general ledger, the following balance accounts are used for open transactions:  

* For vendors, we use the A/P account from the vendor posting group.  
* For customers, we use the A/R account from the customer posting group.  
* For items, we create a general posting setup where the adjustment account is the account specified as the inventory account on the inventory posting setup.  

## Correcting errors

If something goes wrong and an error occurs, the **Status** field shows **Completed with Errors**, and the **Error Count** field will show how many. To view a list of the errors, you can open the **Data Migration Errors** page by choosing:  

* The number in the **Error Count** field for the entity.  
* The entity, and then the **Show Errors** action.  

On the **Data Migration Errors** page, to fix an error you can choose an error message, and then choose **Edit Record** to view the migrated data for the entity. If you have several errors to fix, you can choose **Bulk-Fix Errors** to edit the entities in a list. You still need to open individual records if the error was caused by a related entry, though. For example, a vendor won't be migrated if an email address one of their contacts has an invalid format.

After you fix one or more errors, you can choose **Migrate** to migrate only the entities you fixed, without having to completely restart the migration.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have fixed more than one error, you can use the **Select More** feature to select multiple lines to migrate. Alternatively, if there are errors that are not important to fix, you can choose them and then choose **Skip Selections**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have items that are included in a BOM, you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it. If an item variant is created first, the reference to the original item can cause an error message.  

## Verifying data after migrating

One way to verify that your data migrated correctly is to look at the following pages in C5 and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

|Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 | Dynamics 365 Business Central| Batch Job to Use |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
|Customer Entries| General Journals| CUSTMIGR |
|Vendor Entries| General Journals| VENDMIGR|
|Item Entries| Item Journals| ITEMMIGR |
|G/L Entries| General Journals| GLACMIGR |

## Stopping data migration

You can stop migrating data by choosing **Stop All Migrations**. If you do, all pending migrations are also stopped.

# Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In this article, you learn some of the basics about working with reports. Learn about viewing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (including scorecards and dashboards) and editing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. For general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, see [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports give you insight into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] include a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part that can display [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. The role center is a typical page where you find a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part. Some list pages, like **Items**, also include a Power BI part.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] works together with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Reports for displaying in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are stored in a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can switch the report displayed in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part to any Power BI report available in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. The first time you sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and until you connect to a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], parts are empty, as shown here:

![Power BI part in Business Central.](./media/power-bi-part.png)

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already set up to integrate with Power BI.

### Sign up Power BI

Before you can use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you need to sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If you didn't already sign up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

Once you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Learn more in [Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-sign-in). 

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] hosts all the reports available to you. To see a report in your personal workspace, select **My Workspace** > **Reports**. Then just select the report that you want to view. If you have access to one or more shared Power BI workspaces, you can also see reports in those workspaces.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you automatically get a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. Learn more in [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="connect"></a>Connect to Power BI - one time only

When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an empty [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part (as shown in the previous figure) is most likely available on various pages. The first thing to do is to connect to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account . Once connected, you can see reports. You only have to do this step once.

1. Select the **Get Started with Power BI** link in the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part.
2. The **Set Up [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in Business Central** assisted setup starts. Select **Next** to continue.
3. On the **Check your Power BI License** page, do one of the following steps:

    - If you didn't sign up for Power BI yet, select the [Go to Power BI homepage](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Sign up for an account, then come back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and finish the setup.

    - If you already have a license, select **Next**.
4. In the next page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will now upload a demo report to Power BI. This step takes a few minutes, so it runs in the background. To complete the setup, select **Next**, then **Finish**.

The connection process starts. During the process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] to determine if you have a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  and license. Once your license is verified, the default Power BI report displays on the page. If there a report isn't shown, you can select a report from the part.

> [!TIP]
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, this step automatically uploads default [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your Power BI workspace.

## <a name="apps"></a>Use Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview-table](includes/powerbi-apps-overview-table.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are free to install and use, the only requirement is that users need to have a non-free Power BI license. To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).


<!--#### From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Connecting to Power BI from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is similar to online. However, you might be prompted on the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page to grant access to [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. To grant access, select **Authorize Azure Services**, and then **Accept**.

Once connected, you can select a report from the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on pages.-->

## Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

### Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You want to make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*.  Depending on how your organization set up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand, as needed. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

#### Refresh manually

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

#### Schedule a refresh

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under Datasets, select More options (...) next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

Learn more in [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh)

### Show reports on list pages

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox on several key list pages. This FactBox provides extra insight into the data in the list. As you move between rows in the list, the report is updated and filtered for the selected entry.

To learn how to create reports for list pages, see [Creating [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the Power BI FactBox, it might be hidden on your workspace by personalization. Select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then select **Personalize** action. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
>
> Or if you have an older version of Business Central, go to the action bar, select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports**.

### Switch reports

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on a page can display any Power BI report that's available to you. To switch to view another report, choose the **Select Report** action from the drop-down command list at the top of the part.  

The **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page shows a list of all the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that you have access to. This list is retrieved from any of your own workspaces or workspaces that others shared with you in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Select the **Enable** box for each report that you want to display on the page, and then choose **OK**. You return to the page, and the last report you enabled appears. Using the drop-down command list, use the **Previous** and **Next** commands to navigate between reports.  

### Get more reports

If you don't see any reports on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page, or don't see the report you want, choose **Get Reports**. This action lets you look for reports from two locations: *My Organization* or from *Services*.

- Select **My Organization** to go to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. From here, you can view the reports within your organization that you have rights to view. You can then add them to your workspace.
- Select **Services** to go to Microsoft AppSource where you can install Power BI apps.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI Desktop, you can also create new [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. Then, once those reports are published to your Power BI workspace, they appear on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page.  

### Manage and modify reports

You can make changes to a report in the Power BI part. The changes that you make are then published to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If the report is shared with other users, they'll also see the changes, unless you save the changes to a new report.

To modify a report, choose the **Manage Report** action from the drop-down command list in the Power BI part. Then start making changes. Once you finish making changes, select **File** > **Save**. If it's a shared report, and you don't want to make the change for all users, select **Save As** to avoid making this change for all users.

When you return to the role center, the updated report appears. If you used **Save As**, you have to choose **Select Report**, and then enable the new report to see it.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

### <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have any .pbix files, you can upload and share them with all users of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reports are shared within each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

To upload a report, select the **Upload Report** action from the drop-down command list on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part. Then, locate the .pbix file that defines the reports that you want to share. You can change the default name of the file.  

After the report uploads to your Power BI workspace, it automatically uploads to other users' Power BI workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you have SUPER user permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You don't need any special permission to upload reports to your workspace through the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.
1. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. Learn more in [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). -->

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] - Upload Reports](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

## <a name="share"></a>Share reports with others

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the sharing. Learn more in [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing requires that both you and the people you're sharing the report with have [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type). Otherwise, the content must be in [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). Learn more in [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).

## Fixing problems

However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account 

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  isn't set up for you. To get a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you must have a license, and you must have previously signed into Power BI to create a Power BI workspace.

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Choose Select Report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or it deployed but didn't refresh successfully. Navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

#### You can't see a report on the Select Report page on a list page

It's probably because the report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page. Clear the filter to get a full list of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports available.

# Settle purchase invoices promptly

If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can post the payment when you post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, check, or bank transfer, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice. For more information, see [Defining Payment Methods](finance-payment-methods.md).  

## To settle purchase invoices promptly

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must contact a Microsoft partner who can add the fields through code.  
>
> This customization is only required if you do not specify balancing accounts on the payment methods as describe above.

# Inspecting pages in Business Central

The page inspection feature enables you to get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection is especially designed for administrators, power users, support personnel, and developers. It's ideal for learning the data model behind a page and troubleshooting. For example, if you're experiencing a problem with a page, you can use page inspection to get information to pass on to your system administrator or support personnel.

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, through page inspection, you can start Visual Studio Code from within the web client to further investigate and debug source code of an extension. For more information, see [Troubleshoot in Visual Studio Code directly from the web client](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-troubleshoot-vscode-webclient) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)]

## Work with page inspection

You start page inspection from the **Help & Support** page. Choose the question mark in the top right corner, choose **Help & Support**, and then choose **Inspect pages and data**. Or, you can just use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>.

The **Page inspection** pane opens on the side. When the pane first opens, it shows information that pertains to the main page object.

Use the keyboard or pointing device to move focus to different elements on the page. When you select a FactBox or a part on the main page, the bounding area is highlighted by a border, and the **Page Inspection** pane shows information about the selected element. For example, the previous figure shows information about the list part in the **Sales Order** page. As you navigate to other pages in the application, the **Page Inspection** pane will automatically update with page information as you move along.

For more information about what is shown in page inspection, see [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

If you don't see the details that you expect to see in the **Page Inspection** pane, you probably don't have the required permissions, as described in the next section.

## Controlling access to page inspection details

As an administrator, you can control access to the full details that are shown in the **Page Inspection** pane by configuring the permissions that users have. To grant a user permission to the full details, give users **Execute** permission on the **System** object **5330**. You can grant this permission by using a permission set (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**) or a user group (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**). For more information about permissions, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

Users who aren't granted permissions on **System object 5330** can still access the **Page Inspection** pane, but they will only see the **Page** and **Table** fields, which display basic details that they can pass on to their support team.

# Sustainability scorecards and goals overview

This article offers guidance on how to create scorecards and goals, and how to update the status of goals. Scorecards and goals allow organizations to curate sustainability metrics and track them against key business objectives. Goals can be created based on current and target values, so users can keep track of the progress of current gas emissions, or water/waste intensity, compared to previous periods.  

## Create a scorecard  

To create a sustainability scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Scorecards** page, select **New** to create a new scorecard.  
3. Specify the **No.** and the **Name** fields on the **General** FastTab, and then add the **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Owner** field, you can only choose users who enabled the **Sustainability Manager** field on the **User Setup** page.

## Create goals  

To create a new sustainability goal, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Goals** action to create a new sustainability goal for the scorecard.  
3. Select **New** to start creating a goal.
4. The **Scorecard No.** is automatically added based on the value from the sustainability scorecard, and you can't edit this field. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also fills in the **Unit of Measure** field based on the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  
5. Fill in **No.** and **Name** of the new sustainability goal. The **Owner** field is automatically filled in based on the value from the connected **Sustainability Scorecard**.
6. You can create a sustainability goal for the entire company, a specific country/region, or a facility. To create a specific goal, choose the country or region in the **Country/Region Code** field or the facility in the **Responsibility Center** field.  
7. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields to set up a dedicated period for tracking current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Current Value for CO2**, **Current Value for CH4**, **Current Value for N2O**, **Current Value for Water Intensity**, and **Current Value for Waste Intensity** fields.  
8. Select the **Baseline Start Date** and **Baseline End Date** fields to set up a dedicated baseline period for comparing current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Baseline for CO2**, **Baseline for CH4**, **Baseline for N2O**, **Baseline for Water Intensity**, and **Baseline for Waste Intensity** fields.  
9. You can also add target values in the selected **Unit of Measure** field for the current period using the following **Target Value for CO2**, **Target Value for CH4**, **Target Value for N2O**, **Target Value for Water Intensity**, and **Target Value for Waste Intensity** fields.
10. You can specify one of these goals as a **Main Goal**. Values from the main goal are used on the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center.  

If you have many goals on the page, you can use the **Show My Goals** action to show only your goals. To show all, run the **Show All Goals** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sustainability goals for a specific sustainability scorecard. You can't create goals that aren't related to a scorecard, but you can create more goals for one scorecard. You can only have one sustainability goal as the **Main Goal**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up different combinations of goals for the whole company, specific countries or regions, and a responsibility center for a sustainability scorecard. You can also use different periods for the same model of tracking.

# Create bins

The most effective way to create the bins of your warehouse is to generate groups of similar bins in the bin creation worksheet, but you can also create your bins individually from the location card. You can also use a function on the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page to create bins automatically.  

## To create a bin from the location card

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### The dedicated field

The **Dedicated** field on the **Bins** page specifies that quantities in the bin are protected from being picked for other demands. However, quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

Making a bin dedicated results in similar functionality in basic warehousing to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

### Example

A work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code.

> [!Caution]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production or assembly components with the **Inventory Pick** page. For more information, see [Pick for Production or Assembly in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

## To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you're creating.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bins** action.  

## To make bins automatically in the bin creation worksheet

Before you start creating bins automatically, you should determine the kind of bins that are essential for your operations, and the most practical flow of items through the physical structure of your warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As soon as you use a bin, you cannot delete it unless it is empty. But if you want to use another bin-naming system, you can use the reclassification journal to in effect move your items to a new bin system. This process is manual and takes time, however, so it is best to set up your bins correctly from the start.  

To work with the **Bin Creation Worksheet** page, you must be set up as a warehouse employee at the location where the bins exist. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).    

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Bins** action.
3. On the **Calculate Bins** page, in the **Bin Template Code** field, select the bin template that you want to use as the model for the bins you're creating.
4.  Fill in a description for the bins you are in the process of creating.  
5.  To create the bin codes, fill in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields in the three categories shown on the page: **Rack**, **Section,**, and **Level.** The bin code can contain up to 20 characters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The number of characters that you have entered in the three categories for either field, for example, the characters you have entered in the three **From No.** fields, plus the field separators, if any, must be 20 or less.  

     You can use letters in the code as an identifying combination, but the letter you use must be the same in the **From No.** and **To No.** fields. For example, you might define the Rack part of the code as **From No. A01** and **To No. A10**. The application isn't set up to generate codes with letter sequences, for example, from A01 to F05.  

6.  If you want a character, such as a hyphen, to separate the category fields you have defined as part of the bin code, fill in the **Field Separator** field with this character.  
7.  If you want application not to create a line for a bin if it exists already, select the **Check on Existing Bin** field.  
8. When you finish filling in the fields, choose the **OK** button.

    The application creates a line for each bin in the worksheet. You can now delete some of the bins, for example, if you have a rack with a passageway through the first two levels of a couple of sections.  

9. When you delete all unnecessary bins, choose the **Create Bins** action, and application creates bins for each line in the worksheet.  

Repeat the process for another set of bins until you create all the bins in your warehouse.

# Setting Up Troubleshooting for Service Items
You can set up troubleshooting guidelines that help technicians solve problems when providing service. For example, guidelines might be a list of steps to perform a repair, or a series of questions to ask about the items. After you set up troubleshooting guidelines, you can assign them to service item groups, service items, and items. There is an inheritance hierarchy for guidelines. If you assign them to a service item group, the items included in the group will inherit the guidelines unless you specify them for the items. Similarly, service items will inherit guidelines from items.  

## To set up troubleshooting guidelines
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Troubleshooting**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign troubleshooting guidelines to items, service items, or service item groups
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, **Service Items**, or **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant entity, and then choose the **Troubleshooting** action.

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

## Project Analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: view project costing performance

CFOs want to ensure that you aren't overspending on specific projects from a high-level. By analyzing the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against its budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) report to view key information on profit statics per project.

## Project analytics for project managers

To fit this category, you might have a role such as Project Manager.

### Example scenario: tracking project completion and sales

Project managers want to know how each project is performing and get high-level information about them. The [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report can help you compare key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by using either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) reports.

# Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP system that includes integrated tools to make bookkeeping easier in the system. Many actions can be done automatically.

This article provides an outline of bookkeeping processes, including the rules, procedures, and other guidelines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The content of this article is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers complete their daily work in this ERP system. For additional help, a context-based assistant is incorporated into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This assistant contains links to information that's related to the current page and instructions for working with the relevant process. To access it, select the [**Help**](product-help-and-support.md) button in the upper-right corner to open the **Help** pane. Then use the links in the **About this task or page** and **Related resources from Microsoft Learn** sections.

The following video introduces some of the key capabilities for accounting and bookkeeping.

# Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze fixed assets data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets," "Depreciations over time," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets processes:

- [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

<!-- TODO: add examples for 

insurance coverage ledger entries

-->

## Fixed assets ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of fixed assets scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Fixed Assets (Current value)](#example-fixed-assets-current-value) | Track asset value, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Date**, **FA Posting Type**, and **Amount** |
| [Asset value changes over time](#example-asset-value-changes-over-time) | Track asset value changes over time. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **FA Posting Type**, **FA Posting Date**, and **Amount** |
|[Fixed asset depreciations over time](#example-fixed-asset-depreciations-over-time) | Track depreciations over time, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Year**, **FA Posting Month**, **Amount**, and **FA Posting Type** |

### Example: fixed assets current value

To track the value of one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the **FA Posting Date** and **FA Posting Type** fields.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Asset overview - value**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

### Example: asset value changes over time

To track asset value changes over time, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **FA Posting Type** field to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Drag the **FA Posting Year** and **FA Posting Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Asset value changes over time**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-changes-over-time.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see asset value changes over time." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-changes-over-time.png":::

### Example: fixed asset depreciations over time

To track depreciation for one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Drag the **FA Posting Year** and **FA Posting Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. In the **FA Posting Type** filter field, choose **Depreciation**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Depreciations over time**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see depreciation over time." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png":::

## Using the Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis query

You can use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query to analyze fixed asset ledger entries. The query adds additional information to the ledger entries, such as the fixed asset class, subclass, location, and depreciation book.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets

When you post fixed asset journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **FA Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets is typically done on the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604) page.

You might also want to use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query.

# Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** page, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPrem Notes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**.

# Sales by Salesperson (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Salesperson** report provides an overview of sales performance for each salesperson. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount and quantity. You can also view this information for each customer a salesperson sells to, and the items they sold.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps management and sales teams track the sales amounts that each salesperson generates and their contribution to the overall revenue.

Sales managers can use the report to monitor the sales performance of each salesperson and identify top-performers. For example, this information is helpful when you determine rewards. The report also helps identify under-performers who perhaps need support.

For example, you might notice that a particular salesperson's sales declined over the last few months. With this information, you can provide extra training or resources to help that salesperson achieve their sales targets.

Salespeople can use the report to monitor your own sales performance and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing the sales amount, quantity, and gross profit, you can easily identify which customers and items contribute the most to your sales. With this information, you can focus your efforts on the most profitable areas.

For example, if you notice that a particular customer contributes a significant amount to your sales numbers, you can focus on building a stronger relationship with that customer to increase their loyalty.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Customer
- Salesperson/Purchaser
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use the Sales Order Agent to automate taking sales orders based on customer inquiries about products/items received via email.

The Sales Order Agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. When it identifies a potential request, it starts converting the request into an order. For example, it verifies the customer, checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer with the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, such as reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles email exchanges with the customer to resolve any missing details and allow for modifications to the original request if necessary.

Learn more about the Sales Order Agent and its process flow in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md#how-the-agent-processes-requests).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

The Sales Order Agent is activated, and you have permission to use it. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

## Get started

You collaborate with the Sales Order Agent to review and convert quotes into orders using the **Tasks** tab in the **Copilot** pane.

To access this view, select ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon.](media/soa-activated-number-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** on the upper right of the navigation menu. A red circle with a number on the icon indicates the tasks that need attention.

![Shows the task view with steps](media/soa-task-view-callouts.png)

The ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** tab opens in the **Copilot** pane to display tasks recently created by the Sales Order Agent. Tasks that require attention&mdash;like reviewing an incoming or outgoing email&mdash;are at the top of the list.  

For each sales quote request, the Sales Order Agent adds a task to track, review, and follow up on updates, eventually processing the quote into an order. Tasks can consist of multiple steps that form a timeline of the process.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon with an open action.](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon in the role or select the ![Show summary for Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-summary-icon.png) **Show summary for Sales Order Agent** in the **Task** tab to get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) summarizing the impact of the agent's work in your organization. For example, view the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent, the time saved by your team, and the total number of sales orders created.

## Review and assist

While the agent does the bulk of work autonomously, it asks for user intervention when required for various steps to move through the process, such as:

- Reviewing and confirming incoming email requests from customers.
- Reviewing and confirming the sales quotes and orders if an admin configured the Sales Order Agent to do so.
- Reviewing outgoing emails created by the Sales Order Agent for the customer.
- Providing assistance to the Sales Order Agent when it needs to get unblocked, for example to provide missing data.

Steps requiring intervention are listed under **Needs Attention** in the **Tasks** tab. To review a step:

1. In **Task** tab, select the step requesting review or assistance.

   The task *timeline* opens, focused on the selected step. The timeline displays each step of a task, past and present, in chronological order.

1. Select **Review** for the step.

   The **Tasks** tab switches to **Review** mode, and the Agent Task Message window opens to display the email contents or quote or order, depending on the task.

1. Review the email contents or the quote or order and make changes as needed. You can't edit incoming emails from the customer.

1. When you're satisfied with the content and want the process to continue, select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. If you want to complete the task yourself, select **Stop** to halt the agent's processing of this task.

After confirmation, the Sales Order Agent continues processing the task. When a new notification appears on the Sales Order Agent icon after some time, follow the same flow to verify and approve the results.

## Modify sales quotes and orders

You might need to modify sales quotes or orders created by the agent during a review step or when the agent requests assistance, based on its configuration. When you select **Review**, the quote or order opens for inspection. Make changes as needed, then select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. The agent processes the document, creating a PDF for the outgoing email to the customer.

You also have the opportunity to modify a quote or order during the review step for an outgoing email. In this case, select **...** (More options) > **Discard step** on the step. This action stops the task temporarily to allow you to open the quote or order and makes changes and then resume the step.

![Shows the discard step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-discard-step.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Discard step** is available only on review steps for outgoing emails.

After you make the changes, return to the **Tasks** tab, select one of the following options for resuming the task, and then select **Send**:

- **I have updated the quote** or **I have updated the order** - Select one of these options if you made changes to the quote or order. The agent generates a new PDF and email for the customer.
- **Just resume** - Select this option if you didn't change the quote or order. The agent doesn't generate a new quote or order and keeps the original email as before.  

![Shows the resume step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-resume-step.png)

If you change your mind while reviewing the outgoing message and decide to make more changes to the sales document, use the **Discard step** action to discard the email message generated by the agent. Then, update the sales document as needed and instruct the agent to create a new outgoing email with the updated attachment.

## Assist with item availability

Depending on the agent's setup, it can check item availability in the requested quantity before adding them to a quote or order. You can't change the items and quantities at this point, but you can review and confirm the step so the agent creates a reply email to the customer.

<!--
1. Select **Review** to open the **Items availability** page.
1. Use the page to verify that the item isn't available in the requested quantity.
1. Select **Confirm**.

   The agent creates the reply email for review.-->

Learn more in [Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-item-availability.md).

## Stop a task

Most steps of a task include a **Stop** button that lets you terminate the process. When you select **Stop**, a task isn't terminated immediately—you're asked to confirm before the task is stopped.

Before you stop a task, consider the following behavior:

- Stopped tasks can't be restarted.
- Stopping the task might leave some results incomplete or unwanted, and it might require follow-up actions with the customers. Follow up actions depend on where in the process the task was stopped.

  For example, suppose you stopped a task after a sales quote was created. Although the process stopped, the sales quote is still stored in the system as open. You might have to manually edit the state depending on your company policy and then update the customer.
- Stopped tasks aren't deleted immediately. You can still explore a task's timeline until it's deleted, typically by an administrator.

<!--

## View timeline and details of steps

From the ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** view, you can view the details of each step of a task in chronological order. Click on the task or select **...** (More options) > **Show Details**.-->

## Scenarios impacting reliability in handling customer requests

- You might need to correct the quantities in the created document when non-base units of measurement differ from the standard ones.  

  For example, if the system treats 1 kilogram as 900 grams and a customer requests 2 kilograms, the system might generate a document showing 2,000 grams instead of 1,800 grams or 2 kilograms.

- Reliability decreases if you significantly change the email the agent drafts about item availability before sending it to the customer.

  This issue is more apparent when the external customer follows up with an email using pronouns like "them" or "it" and other words instead of repeating specific quantities and names. For example, the customer replies, "I want them all."

- The agent searches for items using item attributes, but the attributes aren't shown to the agent on the item availability page. This condition decreases reliability for customer requests that depend specifically on the attributes.

  Consider the following example:

  1. Items in the database:
  
     `[{no: ITEM-1, description: Shirt, attributes: Linen}, {no: ITEM-2, description: Shirt, attributes: Cotton}]`

  2. Customer's initial request email:

     `I want a quote for nice shirts`

  3. Agent's reply email:
  
     `We have X quantity of ITEM-1 Shirt and ITEM-2 Shirt`

  4. Customer's response email:
  
     `I want the ones with linen material`

- Reliability decreases when the agent retrieves information from multiple email exchanges with a customer, and the customer uses pronouns or vague references like "that," "them," or "it" in their requests.

# Column definitions in Financial Reporting

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in a report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

## Create a new column definition

To create a new column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Provide a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description** field, provide a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Provide an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a column definition

To edit the content of a column definition, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Printed, previewed, and saved versions of a financial report display a maximum of five columns. In contrast, if a financial report is only meant for analysis on the **Financial Report** page, you can create as many columns as you want.

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. On the **Column Definition** page, create a row for each column of financial data that should show in the financial report. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> Open the **Financial Report** page from time to time to verify that the new column definition works as intended.

## Built-in column definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample column definitions that can help you to quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Column definition code | Description | How to use this column definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 |
-->

## Example: Create a column definition to calculate percentages

You might want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. For example, if you have rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales in each row.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentages are based.  
1. Add a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: 
    1. In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**. 
    1. In the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage is based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.  
1. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows. 
    1. In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**. 
    1. In the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percentage sign (%). So, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.  
1. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## Comparing accounting periods using period formulas

Your financial report can compare the results of different accounting periods, such as the past month versus the same month last year. To do that, open the **Column Definition** page, and personalize it by adding the **Comparison Period Formula** field as a column. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). You can then set that field to a period formula.  

An accounting period doesn't need to match the calendar. However, each fiscal year must have the same number of accounting periods, although each period can be different in length.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the period formula to calculate the duration of the comparison period in relation to the period represented by the date filter on the report. The comparison period is based on the period of the start date of the date filter. The following table shows the abbreviations for period specifications.

| Abbreviation | Description                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P            | Period.                                                                                |
| LP           | Last period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter.                                   |
| CP           | Current period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter. Use CP in formulas to set the period that starts or ends the formula. For example, FY\[1..CP\] denotes the time from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the current period.|
| FY           | Fiscal year. For example, FY\[1..3\] denotes the first quarter of the current fiscal year. |

Examples of formulas:

| Formula | Description |
|-----|-----|
| \<Blank\>       | Current period. |
| \-1P            | Previous period.            |
| \-1FY\[1..LP\]  | Entire previous fiscal year.                  |
| \-1FY           | Current period in previous fiscal year.       |
| \-1FY\[1..3\]   | First quarter of previous fiscal year.        |
| \-1FY\[1..CP\]  | From the beginning of the previous fiscal year to the current period in the previous fiscal year, including both periods. |
| \-1FY\[CP..LP\] | From the current period in previous fiscal year to the last period of the previous fiscal year, including both periods.   |

To calculate by regular time periods, enter a formula in the **Comparison Date Formula** field instead. For example, if the field is set to -1Y, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compares to the same period one year earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> It isn't always obvious which periods you're comparing because you can set a date filter on a report that spans dates that are different than the accounting periods in your chart of accounts. So, if you create a financial report where you want to compare this period to the same period last year, set the **Comparison Date Formula** field to **-1FY**. Then, run the report on **February 28th** and set the date filter to **January and February**. As a result, the financial report compares January and February this year to January last year, which is the only completed accounting period of the two for last year.  

Learn more at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Find the reports that use a column definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a column definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with column definitions

<!-- [!INCLUDE [report-best-practices-column-defs](includes/report-best-practices-column-defs2.md)] -->

## Import or export financial report column definitions

Starting with the 2024 release wave 1 (version 24.1), you can import and export financial report column definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report column definitions, they replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report column definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Column Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, and then choose the **Import Column Definition** or **Export Column Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Copilot data movement across geographies

Although Copilot in Business Central is available in all geographic areas where Business Central online is available, it requires Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is available only in specific regions.  

Depending on where your environment is hosted, you might need to allow data to move outside of your primary data residency to an Azure OpenAI endpoint located in another geography. You provide consent in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If you don't provide consent, Copilot won't be available to your organization. Learn how to provide consent in [Allow data movement across geographies](enable-ai.md#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

Individual Copilot features might not be available in all geographies. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external). Copilot and generative AI features from non-Microsoft publishers, such as those originating from customizations or AppSource apps you install, each define their own specific Azure OpenAI Service regions. Consult with the extension publisher to understand which regional Azure services are used by the extension.

## How data movement across geographies works

When you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any personal data, might move outside of your geography to the location where the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint is hosted. We might store prompt and output data for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but we don't look at it unless our automated systems flag it for review. We don't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models. Learn more at [Abuse Monitoring](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Business Central environment is hosted in the EU Data Boundary, we use an Azure OpenAI endpoint in the same boundary. Learn more: [EU Data Boundary countries and datacenter locations](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn#eu-data-boundary-countries-and-datacenter-locations)

The following table describes when and how data can move across geographies for Copilot in Business Central. 

| Azure&nbsp;region&nbsp;where&nbsp;your&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Central environment is hosted | Azure geography where Azure OpenAI Service is hosted |Consent required for data movement across geographies? |How to allow data to move across geographic areas|

# Set Up Service Offerings
When you set up service management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item that needs servicing, for example, the computer that needs repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.

# Create prepayment invoices

If you require customers to pay before you'll ship their order, you can use the prepayment features. The same applies if your vendor requires you to pay before they ship an order to you.  

You can start the prepayment process when you create a sales or purchase order. The default prepayment percentage for an item on the order, or for the customer or vendor, will be included in the prepayment invoice. You can also specify a prepayment percentage to the entire document.

After you create a sales or purchase order, you can create a prepayment invoice for it. Either use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or adjust the amount. For example, you might specify a total amount for the entire order.  

The following procedure describes how to invoice a prepayment for a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase orders.  

## To create a prepayment invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new sales order for the relevant customer. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

    On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment %** field specifies the percentage to use to calculate the prepayment amount. If there's a default prepayment percentage on the customer card, the field is filled in automatically. You can change the percentage. <!--This percentage is applied to lines where the item on that line does not already specify a prepayment percentage. The prepayment percentage is only copied from the header to lines that do not copy the default prepayment percentage from the item.-->  

    Choose the **Compress Prepayment** field if you want to create lines on the prepayment invoice that combine lines from the sales order if:  

    - They have the same general ledger account for prepayments as determined by the general posting setup.  
    - They have the same dimensions.  

    If you want to specify a prepayment invoice with one line for each sales order line that has a prepayment percentage, don't choose the **Compress Prepayment** field.  

    The due date for the prepayment is calculated automatically based on the value of the **Prepmt. Payment Terms Code**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When some lines on an invoice require 100% prepayment and other lines don't, and there's VAT on the prepayment account, the rounded amount might cause an error when you create a prepayment invoice. The error occurs because the prepayment invoice amount is higher than the amounts on the document lines. To fix the problem, change the amounts on one or all of the lines that require 100% prepayment. The change will recalculate the VAT amount rounding and use the accumulated rounding difference on the last modified line.
    >
    > Two more ways to fix the problem are:
    >
    > * Create a separate VAT product posting group and a VAT posting setup with a separate VAT identifier and use that for the items or lines that require 100% prepayment. Rounding is done for each VAT identifier, so separate rounding will be done for items that are assigned to the VAT product posting group.
    > * Use a separate invoice for the items or lines that do and don't require 100% prepayments.

3. Fill in the sales lines.  

    If you've specified a default prepayment percentage either for the customer or on the **Prepayment** FastTab on this document, this value is copied to each line. You can change the contents of the **Prepayment %** field on the line.  

    > [!TIP]
    > If you do not see the **Prepayment %** field, you can add it through personalization.  For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

4. To view the total prepayment amount, choose the **Statistics** action.

    If you want to adjust the total prepayment amount for the order, you can change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field on the **Sales Order Statistics** page.  

    If the **Prices Including VAT** field is selected, the **Prepayment Amount Incl. VAT** field is editable.  

    If you change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field, the amount will be distributed proportionately between all lines, except lines that have **0** in the **Prepayment %** field.  

5. To print a test report before posting the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Prepayment Test Report** action.  
6. To post the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action.  

    To post and print the prepayment invoice, choose the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  

You can issue other prepayment invoices for the order. To issue another invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines, adjust the document date if necessary, and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced so far and the new prepayment amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are located in North America, you cannot change the prepayment percentage after the prepayment invoice has been posted. This is prevented in the North American version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because the calculation of sales tax will otherwise be incorrect.  

 When you're ready to post the rest of the invoice, post it as you would post any invoice, and the prepayment amount will automatically be deducted from the amount due.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Business Central starting from **2024 release wave 1**.  

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals or purchase documents, and recalculation of emissions to CO2 equivalent. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints; calculation using formulas are available for use only when using sustainability journals.   

> [!NOTE]
> This solution is still in early stages of development and new set of features will be added with the next release.  

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Record emission data directly working with purchase documents.
- Record purchase of carbon credit using purchase documents.
- Calculate internal carbon fee.
- Recalculate emission of all gasses to CO2 equivalent using formulas.
- Post emission entries (and carbon credits) to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions.
- Set scorecards and goals and compare them with baseline and targeted values.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
- Use financial reports for cross functional reporting.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. They generate financial data with every transaction. Every work order represents cost and revenue, and every resource generates profit and loss. Customer interactions add entries on the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two systems.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also facilitates the invoicing and fulfillment of work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] is built on top of Dynamics 365 Sales, you must [set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide) and [enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Virtual Table app is optional. You only need it if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Permissions and security roles for user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User

> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Other settings in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a connection to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] removes the coupling between resources and products. To make [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] items available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], update the **Field Service Product Type** field to match the **Type** field on the items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a product or service](/dynamics365/field-service/create-product-or-service#create-a-product-or-service).

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the Field Service Integration app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

This section describes the key settings in the guide.

Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.

Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.

After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

- When a work order is complete
- When work order products or services are used

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service items (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

## Integration table mappings for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse, so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project (default)** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** | Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** |  Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PROJECTTASK** |  Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC**  | Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**     | (Premium Experience only) Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].        |
|**LOCATIONS**     |  Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. <br><br> **Note:** The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if you turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.      |

In addition to those, the following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project and Service** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**SRVORDER**| Maps service orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], including the status of the orders. |
|**SRVORDERITEMLINE**| Maps service item lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order incidents in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-ITEM**| Maps items on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERLINE-RESOURCE**| Maps resources on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resource booking in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-SERVICE**|Maps service lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERTYPE**| Maps service order types in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order types in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**|Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|

> [!NOTE]
> The integration also maps fields that show item availability information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on work orders and products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. However, the mapping happens through a virtual table, and not an integration table. Some setup is required. To learn more about virtual tables and viewing item availability, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Synchronize location and warehouse data

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes through a unidirectional (from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] .

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### View item availability in Business Central from Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they can be sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to let people view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

The first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability. 

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation.

To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. Choose **Next**.
1. In the **Field in the FS Work Order Product table** field, choose **Product Id**.
1. In the **Field in the Item Availability by Location table** field, choose **itemNo**.
1. Choose **Finish** to complete the guide.
1. To make your setup available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], in the **Power Apps admin center**, choose the view, and then choose the **Save and Publish** action.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

To learn more about virtual tables and synthetic relationships, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).  

The next thing to do is to create and customize the associated view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view, follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

### Integrate service management features

Integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] lets you manage service tasks, consumption, and financial transactions to benefit service technicians, service managers, and finance teams. It's a powerful solution for managing work orders and consumption in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and efficiently invoicing and fulfilling them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration is bi-directional, meaning that when you enter or change data in either app, the data updates in the other.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the integration with service management features, you also enable the integration with projects. You can't enable only the service management integration.

#### Set up the integration with service management features

You must have a **Premium** license. When you do, on the **Company Information** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set the **User Experience** field to **Premium**.

You can enable the integration in the **Integration Type** field by selecting **Project and Service** in the following places:

- In the **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** assisted setup guide.
- On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

When the **Integration Type** field is set to **Project and Service**, the following things happen when you enable the integration:

- Creates a solution in Power Apps named **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Service Integration (service)**.
- Adds integration table mappings for service order types, service documents, service lines, and service item lines. To learn more about the table mappings, go to [Integration table mappings for synchronization](#integration-table-mappings-for-synchronization).
- Fields in the headers on service orders and work orders transfer information, such as the **Service Account**, **Billing Account**, and **Work Order Type**.
- **Service Item Lines** and **Work Order Incidents** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] transfer information about the customer assets being repaired.
- **Service Line** fields and **Work Order Products** and **Work Order Services** fields, such as **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume**.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], make the following settings on the **Service Management Setup** page:

- Turn on the **Service Order Type Mandatory** toggle. This setting is required because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] requires a work order type.
- Make sure that the number series you use for service orders is set up to allow manual numbering. On the **No. Series** page, select the **Manual Nos.** checkbox for the number series. Manual numbering lets you create work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and synchronize them with service orders. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the order number from [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Turn off the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle. This setting lets you have more than one work item line.
- Turn on the **Archive Orders** toggle.
- Make the **Service Order Type** field on service orders mandatory because the **Work Order Type** is mandatory on [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders.

If you choose **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** when you set up the integration, you can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically becomes input for planning through synchronized service orders.

As service or work orders progress toward completion, their status changes. The following table shows how the statues align in both apps.

|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] status  |[!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] status  | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Pending  |Unscheduled| Bidirectional per mapping to account for item demand. |
|Pending  |Scheduled  | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice.|
|In process | In progress | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice. |
|Finished | Completed     | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Ready for posting in Business Central. |
|Finished | Posted        | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When fully invoiced or deleted after partial invoicing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|N/A     | Canceled      | Not synchronized. Manual alignment is needed for canceled work orders. |

### Upgrade your integration to include service management features

If you set up the integration to only include projects, but decide to add service management features later, that's easy to do in just a few steps. Remember that you must have a Premium license though.

1. On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.
1. In the **Integration Type** field, choose **Project and Service**.
1. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

## Use data in both applications

The following sections describe the features where you can use the data that comes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Field Service

You can [create work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order) using the **Service Account** and **Billing Account** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On work orders, you must select the **Business Central Project Task** in the **External Project** field. Selecting a project lets you synchronize work order products and services to the appropriate project task in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can add inventory and noninventory items as **Work Order Products** on work orders and get the quantity on hand and costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a work order from the work order form and record list](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order#create-a-work-order-from-the-work-order-form-and-record-list).

You can add items of the type service as **Work Order Services**, and get costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Products and services tab](/dynamics365/field-service/work-order-experience#products-and-services-tab).

> [!NOTE]
> When a product or service's status on a work order changes from **Estimated** to **Used** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], they synchronize to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can book a resource and relate the **Bookings** to work order services using a **Bookable Resource** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can use the **Open in Business Central** action in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse.

Use the **Open in Business Central** action to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse. On the **Products** page, technicians can check how much of particular product is available at a warehouse they specify.

From the **Work Order** and **Product** pages, you can view where, and how much, of an item is available. On the **Related** menu, choose **Items Availability by Location**.

When you mark a work order product or service as **Used** on a work order with a specific work order type, the lines synchronize to a service order. Consumption is also posted, based on settings on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

During consumption and invoice posting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantities are updated on the original work order product and work order service lines in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Business Central

Depending on your settings on the **Field Service Integration Setup** page, when work orders include products and services, consumption information is transferred and posted using a **Project Journal** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Quantity To Bill** and **Duration To Bill** values are copied to the **Qty- to Transfer to Invoice** field. Based on those values, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to invoice the customer. After the invoice is posted and synchronized to the Dynamics 365 Sales environment, or consumption is processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantity invoiced and quantity consumed display on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab on the **Work Order Product** and **Work Order Service** pages.  

Use the **Project Planning Lines** page to track posting and invoicing of consumption on work orders. From the **Project Planning Lines** page, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize them with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and keep track of the status of the invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Work order services with a booking that uses a bookable resource that's coupled to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resource synchronize to two project journal lines:
>
> - One line of type **Budget** for the coupled resource
> - One line of type **Billable** for the item being serviced
>
> The product that's chosen on the work order service must be coupled to an item of the type **Service** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, the base unit of measure for the item must be set to the **Hours Unit of Measure** that's chosen on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
>
> You can create an invoice for an item of the type **Service** from the billable project planning line, and use the budget project planning line to register cost with the resource.

Use the **Locations in Field Service** action on the **Locations** and **Location Card** pages to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs. You can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in Business Central's inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically become an input for planning.

# OneDrive in Business Central FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers common questions about using OneDrive for Business with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Does this work with all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] clients?

Yes. You can open files in OneDrive from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile apps, when viewing card details in Microsoft Teams, or even from the Outlook add-in.  

## Is OneDrive the same as SharePoint for storing files?

No. OneDrive is private by default, allowing you to organize and share content, while SharePoint offers a shared file repository for your organization. Additionally, OneDrive is included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support consumer OneDrive?

No. This integration is exclusively intended for OneDrive for Business and only supports your work account. 

## Are all OneDrive for Business plans supported?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support standalone OneDrive for Business plans. OneDrive must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise plan. Learn more at [Compare OneDrive plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?market=af&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

## Where can I see OneDrive service health?

Administrators can access the Service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The dashboard includes OneDrive's service availability. Visit the [Service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth).

## Is OneDrive integration available to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises?

Yes, but unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, it does require more setup. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central on-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## How does this work in an organization with multiple environments?

The integration assumes that company names are unique across [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. When company names are unique across the organization, opening a file in OneDrive will copy the file to a folder named after the current company. If company names aren't unique across environments, files from identical company names might be placed together in the same folder.  

## We changed the company name. What happens to my previous files?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically migrate files you opened earlier in OneDrive to the new folder. After you rename your company, the Open in OneDrive action will copy files to a folder that has the new company name.   

## When I want to attach a file in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], how do I pick a file from OneDrive?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide a cloud file picker. You must download the file from OneDrive to your device, and then upload it to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## I want to open files in SharePoint instead. How do I do this?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide features to copy files to SharePoint and open them from a SharePoint library. Contact your Microsoft partner to understand your options, or search for apps on AppSource.  

## How do I turn off integration to OneDrive?

Run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide and turn off the **Use OneDrive for app features** and **Use OneDrive for system features** switches.

## Should I use the SharePoint Connection Setup page to connect to SharePoint?

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central on-premises, version 21 and 22

This page is a legacy feature where all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files from all users are sent to a single SharePoint folder. We recommend that you don't configure the Shared Documents FastTab on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page because this page is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup) and removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. We recommend that you use the **OneDrive Setup** instead.  

## Which version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports OneDrive?

Integration with OneDrive became available in 2021 release wave 2.  

## <a name="features"></a>Which features are affected by OneDrive integration?

In the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide for setting up OneDrive integration, you can turn on or off features for handling Business Central files in OneDrive. The features are divided between two options:

|Option|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Use for app features**|If you turn on this option, the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions are made available on files in Business Central, like files attached to documents or in the report inbox. These actions let users copy, open, and share files in OneDrive. Learn more in [Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).
|**Use for system features**|Turning on this option activates the following features:<ul><li> The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. Learn more in [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).</li><li> Sending a report to an Excel or Word file automatically copies the file to OneDrive, then opens it in the Excel or Word online. Learn more in [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).|

## Will Microsoft continue to improve the integration to OneDrive?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1).  

If you want to participate in improving OneDrive integration, or have an idea that would improve file sharing and collaboration in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

## Does OneDrive work for guest users and delegated admins?

OneDrive features don't work when you're signed in to Business Central as a guest user. For example, if you select **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** on a file, you get the message "Could not connect to your OneDrive for Business."

If you're signed in as a delegated admin, files are downloaded instead of connecting to OneDrive.

These limitations apply to all OneDrive-based features in Business Central, including file sharing, opening, or editing.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides information about how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using OneDrive with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Business Central can't find my OneDrive

When this message displays, "Could not determine the location of your OneDrive for Business, contact your partner to set this up.", check whether the user accessed their OneDrive at least one time. If they haven't, ask the person to visit [https://portal.office.com/onedrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) to set it up. This step can take a while. If the message still displays after 24 hours, contact Support.  

### I'm having problems sharing from Outlook

Learn more at [Can't share OneDrive files from Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-t-share-onedrive-files-from-outlook-com-05d4cb21-40a2-40e3-b111-82cddb82d22f) on Microsoft Support.

### Actions Open in OneDrive and Share are missing

There are a couple things you can check:

- Check that the application features for OneDrive are turned on in the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide. Learn more in [Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup](admin-onedrive-integration.md#configure-onedrive-using-onedrive-setup).
- Check that Microsoft OneDrive is set to **Agree** in the **Privacy Notices Status** page. Learn more in [Privacy Notices Status](privacy-notices-status.md).

# Report selection for documents in Business Central

You can set up default reports to use to print sales, purchases, and service documents, such as orders, quotes, and invoices, and which layout is used. For example, if you have a specific layout for sales invoices, you can specify that report in the **Report Selections - Sales** page. You can then use the report when you send or print sales invoices.  

## Available report selections

The **Report Selections** pages specify the reports to print in different situations and the layout to use. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides default configurations, but you can change them if needed. You can also add reports to the **Report Selection** pages if you want to print more than one report per document type, for example.

The following table describes where you can find information about the different pages.  

|Area or task  |Learn more|
|--------------|----------|
|Example of how report selection works (sales)|[Report selection for sales documents](#example-report-selection-for-sales-documents)|

|Define reports for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Germany)|[Set Up Reports for VAT and Intrastat](LocalFunctionality/Germany/how-to-set-up-reports-for-vat-and-intrastat.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can include additional **Report Selection** pages, depending on your location and industry, for example. To check your setup, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selection**, then choose the relevant link.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following **Report Selection** pages:

* **Report Selection - Sales**  
* **Report Selection - Project**  
* **Report Selection - Service**
* **Report Selection - Purchase**  
* **Report Selection - Cash Flow**  
* **Report Selection - Warehouse**  
* **Report Selection - Inventory**  
* **Report Selection - Bank Account**  
* **Report Selection - Production Order**  
* **Report Selection - Reminder/Finance Charge**  

## Example: Report selection for sales documents

The **Report Selection - Sales** page offers default reports to use in different scenarios for each related document type. Choose a document type in the **Usage** field, then add or review the report selection. You can set up more than one report and specify the sequence the reports must be sent or printed in.  

[!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can't send all document types as email attachments. For the document types you can, the **Report Selection** page contains extra fields.  

For example, on the **Report Selection - Sales** and **Report Selection - Purchase** pages, the following fields help you set up email:

|Field name |Description  |
|-----------|-------------|
|**Use for Email Body**| Insert summarized information, such as the invoice number, due date, or a link to a payment service in an email.|
|**Use for Email Attachment**| Attach the related document to the email.|
|**Email Body Layout Description**|Specify the email body layout to use. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |
|**Report Layout**|Specify the layout to use for the report. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |

# Set Up Vendor Bank Accounts

Just as you can use bank account information on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your company's banking transactions, you can also set banking details for vendors. Vendor bank account data can simplify payments to suppliers when combined with the [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) or the [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md) feature, for example.

## Add or edit a vendor bank account

[!INCLUDE [purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can set additional vendor bank accounts on the **Vendor Bank Account List** page.

## Set up a preferred vendor bank account

If a vendor has one or more bank accounts and you want to set a preferred option for the payment journal lines, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the vendor.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, choose the default vendor bank account in the **Preferred Bank Account Code** field.

# Save and personalize list views

When you set a filter on a list and you want to keep the filter for later, you can save it as a view. To learn more about filtering lists, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).

If views exist, the **Views** group appears at the top of the filter pane. Views are variations of the list that is preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want per list. The views will be available the next time you open the list, from any device or browser.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## To save a view

1. Open any list page.
2. Select ![Filter pane icon.](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.
3. Set one or more new filters. To learn more, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).
4. When you set  the filters, choose the ![Save View.](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon.

    If you set a filter for a list view that was already saved as a view, the existing view updates when you save.
5. If you're saving a new view, enter a name for the view in the **All (Copy)** box, such as "Items I own".
6. To accept the name, select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or move the cursor from the text box.

If you don't give it a name, the default name is **All (Copy)**.

> [!TIP]
> Not seeing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon? To learn more, go to [Why don't I have a Save icon](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-views-faq#save).

## To rename or remove a view

1. For the view that currently displays the list, choose the ![Show more options.](media/show-more-options-icon.png "Show more options") icon to see which options are available.
2. Choose either the **Rename** or the **Remove** action.

## Managing Many Views

As the number of views on a page grows, you might need more control over how views are presented in the filter pane. With the **Personalizing** banner, you can hide unwanted views or reorder your views to get the perfect sequence. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

# Purchase items for a sale by creating purchase invoices

From sales orders and sales invoices, you can use functions to quickly create purchase documents for missing item quantities that are required by the sale. You can use two different functions depending on the document type.

> [!Note]
> This functionality is for replenishing sales items into your own inventory. To purchase items for direct delivery from your vendor to your customer, you must create a drop shipment. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).   

|Function|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Create Purchase Orders**|From a sales order, this function creates a purchase order for each vendor of items on the sales order. You can edit the purchase quantity before you create the purchase orders. Only unavailable sales quantities are suggested.
|**Create Purchase Invoice**|From a sales order and from a sales invoice, this function creates a purchase invoice for a selected vendor for all lines or selected lines on the sales document. The full sales quantity is suggested.|

## To create one or more purchase orders from a sales order
To create a purchase order for each unavailable item quantity on the sales order, you use the **Create Purchase Orders** function.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales order that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.

    The **Create Purchase Orders** page opens showing a line for each different item on the sales order. Lines for both fully available sales quantities and unavailable sales quantities (grayed) are shown by default. You can choose the **Show Unavailable** action to only see lines for unavailable sales quantities.

    The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable sales quantity by default.
4. To purchase another quantity than the unavailable sales quantity, edit the value in the **Quantity to Purchase** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on grayed lines even though they represent fully available sales quantities.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase order is created for each vendor of items on the sales order, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page.
7. Proceed to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).


## To create a purchase invoice from a sales order or sales invoice
To create a single purchase invoice for one or more lines on a sales document by first selecting which vendor to buy from, you use the **Create Purchase Invoice** function.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This function creates a purchase invoice for the exact item quantity on the selected sales document. To change the purchase quantity, you must edit the purchase invoice after it is created.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that you want to purchase items for.
3. Select one or more sales invoice lines that you want to use on the purchase invoice. To use all the sales invoice lines, select either all of them or don't select any lines.
4. Choose the **Create Purchase Invoice** action.
5. Select either **All Lines** or **Selected Lines**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6. In the list of vendors that appears, select the vendor that you want to buy all the items from, and then choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase invoice is created that contains one, more than one, or all the lines on the sales invoice.
7. Proceed to process the purchase invoice, for example, by editing or adding purchase invoice lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features a **Service Tasks** page that gives an overview of all the service items that need attention. Think of it as your service dashboard where you can see what orders are pending, look for and register spare parts, and keep your inventory up-to-date.  

To track changes and get a graphical view of your service business, use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] statistics tools for quick, automatically generated charting and analysis.  

## To work on a service task  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. Select the service task you want to work on. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action. The **Service Item Worksheet** page opens.  
6. Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
7. In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.  

## To register service operations  
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent. The data you specify is stored on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can update the data when necessary.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to register the service for, and choose the item line.  
3. Choose the **Service Item Worksheet** action  
4. On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  

## To register spare parts  
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to use spare parts for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the spare parts you use on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the relevant spare part.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of items you want to use.  

 You can use a similar procedure to register the spare parts on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the **Service Order** page.  

## To register spare parts from a service order  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order you want to register spare parts for.  
3. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. enter a new service line.  

## To replace a service item or a service item component  
When you service a service item that is composed of components, you may need to replace a faulty component with a new one. Every time that you enter a spare part for a service item with components, you have the option of replacing a component or creating a new one. The new item is not registered as a component of the service item until you post this service line or the service order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the component to replace.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens with three options: **Replace Component**, **New Component**, and **Ignore**. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option | Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Replace Component**|Changes the status of the component you are replacing to not active, and it will appear on the replaced component list for the service item.|  
    |**New Component**|Enters the new component in the component list of the service item.|  
    |**Ignore**|Does nothing to the component list of the service item.|  

7. Choose **Replace Component**.  
8. Choose the component to replace, and then choose **OK**.  

## To change the response time for a service item line  
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, depending on whether the service item is on a service contract the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order or quote to open the card.  
3. On the service item line you want to change the response time for, either in the **Response Time (Hours)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.  

## To register fault/resolution codes  
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault/resolution codes relationships. The fault and resolution codes will appear in the corresponding fields on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can also register the codes directly in this page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Service Item Worksheet** page, choose **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault/Resolution Codes Relationships** page opens.  

  >  [!NOTE]
  >  Filters are set on the relationships that are shown on the page by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

4. Fill out the line. Choose the combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose **OK** to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination on the page.

# Set up bank accounts

Use bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in your local currency or a foreign currency. After you set up bank accounts, you can also print checks. Bank accounts also offer features for [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md), [bank reconciliation](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md), and the import and export of bank files.

You can include bank accounts in transactions in general journal. Each bank account links to an account in the chart of accounts through the assigned bank account posting group. Using a bank account in a payment transaction automatically creates an entry in both the bank account and the connected general ledger (G/L) account.  

Bank accounts work differently depending on whether a currency code is specified:

- If a currency code isn't specified, all transactions in the bank account are in the local currency (LCY) for the current company. If you make a transaction for the account in another currency, the amounts post to the account in LCY based on the currency exchange rate. Any checks issued from this account must be in LCY. If the bank account is used in a journal, the journal line automatically uses the blank currency code.  
  
- If a currency code is specified, all transactions made to this account, and all checks issued from it, must use the same currency as the account.

You can save time on data entry by making a bank account the default account to use for the currency specified for the account. If you do, the account is assigned to sales and service documents that use the currency. To make the account the default for sales and service documents, on the **Bank Account Card** page, turn on the **Use as Default for Currency** toggle. If needed, you can choose a different account when you're working on a document.

A bank account is an integral part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and plays a role in many other capabilities. The following illustration shows the most important relations:

![Illustration of bank account relations.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank_Account_Relations.png)

Creating a bank account makes it available in all the places shown in the illustration, and are mirrored in the G/L account and on the **Company Information** page.

Bank accounts are often monitored daily to ensure new payments from customers are registered as quickly as possible. Registering payments quickly helps ensure a customer's actual status is reflected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Keeping the status of customer payments current helps sales people, accountants, and other employees making unnecessary calls regarding overdue invoices or delays in shipments.  

![Illustration of bank payment.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank-payment-flow.png)

Another task is to import vendor currency payments with the realized currency rates to make sure that the actual status of the vendors is up-to-date. Using the [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) capability is the easiest way to do that. In the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, you can import bank transactions directly from an online bank application and post them more or less automatically. The journal automatically identifies and posts the following transactions:  

- Direct debit payments from customers.  
- Customer payments of single invoices.  
- Lump-sum payments from customers.  
- Customer payments in foreign currencies.  
- Vendor payments.  
- Vendor payments in foreign currency.  
- Vendor payments and subscriptions that are recurring.  
- Bank charges and interests.  

Payment reconciliation provides significant time savings in posting incoming and outgoing payments. However, the transactions on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't considered 100% correct until you run a bank reconciliation.  

Bank reconciliation is how you make sure that the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the external account at the bank.  

 ![Illustration of bank account reconciliation.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/BankReconciliation.png)

In the illustration, the left side represents the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the rightmost side represents transactions imported from the bank through the online bank application. The diagram in the middle shows the transactions from both sides that make up the bank reconciliation.

From the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], most transactions should be known to the physical bank. The few exceptions include the following cases:  

- Corrections posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
- Checks issued that aren't cashed.
- Vendor payments not yet approved by the bank.  

From the physical account at the bank, transactions not identified in the payment reconciliation journal arrive all the time, such as the following transactions:  

- New vendor subscriptions  
- Customer payments without description
- Bank interest
- Bank charges
- Credit card charges not yet reported

The better you are at mapping information in the payment reconciliation journal, the more transactions are posted automatically and the easier periodic bank reconciliation becomes.

The following video shows the basic steps to set up a bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    An example would be the **Bank Acc. Posting Group** field that connects the bank account to the underlying G/L account in the balance sheet. Learn more at [Set Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).

> [!TIP]
> Some fields are hidden until you choose the **Show more** action, typically because they are rarely used. Others must be added through personalization. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

You can create as many bank accounts as you need for your business. For each bank account, you must specify information that makes the bank account uniquely identifiable. This information includes the bank's geographical address; number series for different types of transactions, such as direct debit and credit transfers; the currency amounts are specified in; and information used for importing bank statements.

-->

## To enter an opening balance

To fill in the **Balance** field with an opening balance, you must post a bank account ledger entry with the amount in question. You post the entry through a bank account reconciliation. Learn more at [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  
>
> Alternatively, you can implement the opening balance as part of general data creation in new companies using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup guide. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that were posted directly to it typically prevent you from reconciling the bank account. With foreign currency bank accounts, direct posting results in differences that accumulate as you post more bank reconciliations. Usually, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, later you can reverse it out of the G/L account you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In either case, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation&mdash;especially if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

## To set up your bank account for import or export of bank files

The fields related to the import and export of bank feeds and files are on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Bank Account Card** page. Learn more at [Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account to export or import bank files for.
3. On the **Transfer** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** page. You'll be informed of wrong or missing setup values when you export the file. Read the short descriptions of the fields carefully or refer to the related procedure topics. For example, exporting a payment file for North American electronic funds transfer (EFT) requires that both the **Last Remittance Advice No.** and the **Transit No.** fields be filled in. Learn more at [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

The fields on the **Transit** FastTab on the bank account serve different purposes, depending on whether the payment is inbound or outbound.

The following illustration shows the route of inbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

1. The transactions are exported from the bank account in either a human-readable .csv format or the bank's own format.
2. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
3. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
4. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
5. The payments are imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::

        ![Illustration of payments received from the bank into bank accounts.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/payments-in-and-out-1.png)

  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Incoming payments are always imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or directly into the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. In contrast, outgoing payments can originate from any payment journal. The only prerequisite is that the **Allow Payment Export** field in the relevant payment journal batch must be selected.

The following illustration shows the route of outbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

6. The transactions populate in a payment journal that was prepared for exporting payments to file.
7. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
8. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
9. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at see [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
10. The payments are exported from the payment journal and imported into the bank account.

## To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files

Fields on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Vendor Bank Account Card** page are related to the export of bank feeds and files. Learn more at [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

[!INCLUDE[purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

## Changing your bank account

To use a different bank account for your business, you must create the new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We recommend that you don't just replace the information about the account you're currently using because that can cause incorrect data. For example, your opening balance might be incorrect or your bank feed might stop working correctly. It's important that you keep the current and new accounts separate.

After you create the new bank account, you should also create a new bank posting group and assign it to a new general ledger account. You can reuse an existing bank posting group, and bank transactions are posted to the same general ledger accounts as other bank accounts sharing that bank posting group. However, we recommend that you create a new bank posting group and general ledger account so that reconciliations are easier to do.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the bank account information on open sales invoices still shows the original bank account. Accordingly, payments are likely to still be posted to that account. We recommend that you keep both accounts active for a period of time after the change.

To get a more condensed view of your cash accounts in financial reporting, use the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts in your chart of accounts, the **Totaling** rows in financial reports, or G/L account categories. Learn more at [Business Intelligence and Financial Reporting](bi.md) section.

# Working with RDLC Layouts

RDLC layouts are based on report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). The design concepts for RDLC layouts are similar to other layout types. The layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word and Excel layouts.

[![Shows the different elements of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout.png)](media/rdlc-layout.png#lightbox)

## Required tools

To modify RDL layouts, you can use either Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft Visual Studio with the RDLC Report Designer extension.

- Report Builder is a stand-alone app installed on your computer by you or an administrator. With Business Central on-premises, Report Builder is automatically installed with the Business Central Server installation. For more information about installing Report Builder, see [Install Report Builder](/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder) in the SQL Server documentation.

- RDLC Report Designer is an extension for Visual Studio 2019 and later. You can download and install RDLC Report Designer from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProBITools.MicrosoftRdlcReportDesignerforVisualStudio-18001).

## Create and modify RDLC layouts

Creating and modifying RDLC layouts is an advanced task, which is typically done by power users or developers. The basic concepts aren't specific to Business Central report layouts. For this reason, we refer you to the following documentation:

- [Create RDL Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-rdl-report-layout)

   This article explains how to create an RDLC report layout from AL code.

- [Reports, Report Parts, and Report Definitions](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/reports-report-parts-and-report-definitions-report-builder-and-ssrs?)

   This links you to the SQL Server Reporting Services documentation for RDL/RDLC. This article explains the concepts behind RDL/RDLC and how to use Report Builder.

> [!NOTE]
> Report Builder only recognizes the .rdl file type, not .rdlc. Layout files exported from Business Central are .rdlc file types. So to modify these layout in Report Builder, rename the file type to .rdl.

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Review the purchase order lines, and in the **Vendor No.** field, select the vendor that supplies the goods.
5. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action to convert the lines to a purchase order.

## To view the linked purchase order from the sales order

Select the drop-shipment sales order line, choose the **Order** action, choose the **Drop Shipment** action, and then choose the **Purchase Order** action.

## To post a drop shipment

After the vendor ships the items, you can post the sales order as shipped. You can also post the purchase order, but only with the **Receive** option until the sales order has been invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales order that you created in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
3. In the **Qty. to Ship** field, specify how many of the order quantity to ship, the full or a partial order quantity.
4. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Send** action.
5. Choose either the **Ship** option to invoice later, or the **Ship and Invoice** option to invoice immediately.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget that you need to post the purchase order invoice.

# Get ready for doing business

Congratulations, you have your first company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To help you get ready for doing business, you can visit the **Assisted Setup** page where you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help articles for selected setup tasks. To access the page, choose [this link](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801).  

Alternatively, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Assisted Setup** action.

You can also find the list of assisted setup guides if you choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

## Get started

When you sign in for the first time or launch a new company, the **Get Started** checklist takes you through the steps to make you ready for business. The steps vary depending on your country/region and any industry-specific functionality that you added to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Starting with 2021 release wave 2, when you first sign in to the CRONUS demonstration company, your home page is optimized for your first experiences. If you prefer to see more links to more pages, just switch to the Business Manager role. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

After you migrate data, such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you're ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if other assisted setup guides on the list can help you.

If an area isn't covered by an assisted setup, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Advanced Settings** action. In **Advanced Settings**, the **Manual Setup** section provides access to setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The list of assisted setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does.
>
> The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

After you run an assisted setup guide, it's marked as **Completed**.  

## Teaching tips and tours

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes in-product tours and teaching tips that can help you get started. In the current version, there are tours for the steps in the **Get started** list and some of the most commonly used pages in the demonstration company, such as the **Sales Invoice** card page.  

Teaching tips are short messages that inform, remind, or teach you about important and new capabilities that launch automatically when you open a page. For example, to see the teaching tip for the **Sales Invoice** card, choose the link in the top left corner of the page where it says *Sales Invoice*. This launches a callout with a short description of the page and what you can do there. If a tour exists for the page, a link invites you to take the tour. The *Learn more* link takes you to the product Help for the page.

## Role-specific home pages

Depending on your role, the home page provides an overview of the business. The navigation bar gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. The **Activities** tiles show current data and provide easy access to the selected document.

The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favorite Customers** on the home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

Use the arrows to collapse a part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the home page you'll find all of the actions that you can use in the current content. You can collapse this area too. To expand it again, select or tap in the collapsed area.

> [!TIP]  
> You can get back to the home page by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

## Company information

Under **Company Settings**, you can view and edit setup information about the current company. Much of this information was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.

# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away, a movement, or a warehouse put-away to put away the output.  

## Put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post output for a production or assembly order in advanced warehouse configurations, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the number of the source document, such as the production order number, in internal put-away or movement documents for assembly or production output.  

You can also use warehouse put-aways for production outputs, which means you can use the same warehouse process for production outputs as you use for other receipts. Using the same process makes things easier because you don't have to switch between different types of document. Also, it's especially valuable for advanced configurations where Directed Put-Away and Pick is enabled because inventory put-away documents aren't available.

To use warehouse put-aways, on the **Location Card** page, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, choose **Warehouse Put-away**.

> [!NOTE]
> For locations where Directed Put-away and Pick is enabled, make the field editable and allow the selection of **No warehouse handling** or **Warehouse put-away**. You can't select the **Inventory Put-away** option.
>
> You can't activate warehouse put-away if there are released production orders for the selected location.

When you post production output for a location where the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field is set to **Warehouse Put-away** on the **Location Card** page, the warehouse put-away document is either created automatically or you must use the **Warehouse Put-Away Worksheet** page.

If you delete a warehouse put-away, you can manually create a new one using the **Create warehouse put-away** action on the **Release Production Order** or **Finished Prod Order** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have production order lines with different locations with **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** set to **Warehouse Put-away**. To resolve this issue, use different production orders.
>
> You can't cancel output if there are outstanding or completed put-aways.

# Sales Order Agent overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Order Agent helps Business Central users automate capturing sales orders. The agent uses AI to analyze customer requests received via email, locate the customer in Business Central, and engage in multi-turn email conversations to clarify requests if important details are missing or more choices are available. It also checks and informs the customer about the availability of the items they're looking for and follows up with a sales quote. The quote is formatted as a PDF and includes the requested items, quantities, units of measure, prices, taxes, requested delivery dates, provided external document reference, and other important details.

> [!TIP]
> Watch a short video in the Dynamics Business Central channel on YouTube at [Get started with the Sales Order Agent for Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6icbmbLc_Og).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->
## Functionality

### Activation and configuration

The agent is readily available in the product. To activate it, you specify the email inbox you want the agent to monitor. Additionally, specify your preferences for certain aspects of the agent's behavior and designate the users authorized to use the agent to process customers' orders, enabling the agent to act on behalf of a company, department, or team&mdash;not just an individual user.

### Permissions and profiles

The agent operates within the permissions and profile (role) assigned to it by the administrator. Permissions define which areas of the product (tables) the agent has access to. The profile outlines the UX elements (pages and actions) the agent can engage with during its work. Default permissions and the profile are assigned to the agent out of the box; however, administrators can update these permissions as needed.

### Operation

The Sales Order Agent is designed to run autonomously in the background, using AI to perform its tasks while keeping users informed about key steps and involving them when necessary. Involvement might be needed in specific scenarios, for instance to review outgoing messages or to provide missing details, based on configured preferences.

Conceptually, the agent interacts with Business Central functionality in a manner similar to how Business Central users interact with it. The agent is provided with general instructions, expressed in natural language, outlining how the process of capturing sales orders should be handled. It then uses UI metadata, such as captions, tooltips, and other properties, combined with the data presented on Business Central pages and its own instructions, to determine each step required to complete the task. Starting from the designated Role Center, the agent navigates the pages, invokes UI actions, and enters data as a user would. This approach allows a high degree of flexibility and adaptability for the agent to achieve its goal because the agent’s interaction surface and steps aren’t hardcoded. Instead, AI determines them based on the context of each step.

This flexibility enables the agent to discover and interact with relevant custom fields and actions. It can also attempt to automatically resolve validation errors by processing displayed error messages and adjusting the input accordingly.

### Email monitoring and communications

The agent relies on an internal email dispatcher running as a background task to continuously monitor a designated mailbox for item requests. The dispatcher triggers the agent to perform tasks and subsequently sends results, such as prepared sales quotes or orders, to the customer in response.

The agent helps with composing email bodies based on the context of the current step. For instance, it can list available inventory or provide a brief description of the attached sales quote or sales order. Additionally, it can detect and flag irrelevant or potentially malicious email content, prompting users to review and decide how to proceed.  

### Customer and Business Central user involvement

Users can inspect the agent's steps and the created sales documents. They can easily identify the data entered by the agent compared to data generated by Business Central's own business logic and provide more input if needed, such as adding discounts or updating shipping costs.

If the customer decides to update the quote by sending another email listing required changes, the agent assists with these changes by locating the quote and making the requested updates. Once the customer confirms the quote's accuracy, the agent converts it into a sales order, which is then also shared with the customer via email, following user's confirmation. 

The agent always involves designated Business Central users to review and approve all outgoing messages, before they're sent to the customers.

## How the agent processes requests

The agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. The mailbox is specified in the Sales Order Agent configuration (learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md)). When the agent identifies a potential request in an email, it starts to prepare a sales quote. For example, it verifies whether the customer is registered in Business Central. It then checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer that includes the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, like reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles back-and-forth email exchanges with the customer to resolve missing details and allow modifications to the original request. Learn more in [Agent process flow](#agent-process-flow).

### Identifying customers/contacts and related documents

The agent ensures that a request from one customer can't be about another customer's requests. When the agent processes a request, it first identifies the customer in Business Central using the sender's email address. The agent searches for the email among the registered Business Central contacts, sales quotes and orders, and then looks up the customer linked to that email:

- If a customer is found, the agent filters to use only sales quotes and orders that belong to the customer.

  This behavior ensures that the agent only creates and updates documents belonging to the customer that sent the email

- If a contact is found but it's not a customer, the agent filters to use only documents belonging to the contact. Quotes can be sent to contacts that aren't registered as a customer.
- If no contact is found, the agent filters out all documents, and it might request user intervention because it can't find the document.

To prevent the agent from requesting intervention and to assist with reviewing incoming messages, the agent verifies whether the contact is registered and displays a notification on the incoming message review page if it isn't. To resolve this issue, you can either register a new contact/customer or update the contact information of an existing contact/customer. The agent generates the notification to indicate that the contact email wasn't found.

### Finding products/items

The agent analyzes incoming emails to detect parameters for preparing a new sales quote or updating an existing one. Apart from the items themselves, parameters might include the item attributes, quantities, units of measure, requested delivery date, external document number, and more. The agent then searches for these items in Business Central's inventory, within a wide range of related tables.

|Table|Fields|
|-|-|
|Items|No.<br>Description<br>Description 2<br>Search Description<br>GTIN<br>Vendor Item Number|
|Item Variant|Code<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Reference|Reference No.<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Attributes|Name<br>Value|
|Item Category| Code<br>Description<br>Parent Category - 1 Level|
|Item Translation|Language<br>Description<br>Description 2|
|Item Identifier|Code|
|Extended text Line|Text|

Although the agent can find products based on vague and incomplete descriptions, its effectiveness is influenced by the quality of product information in Business Central. You can improve the agent's ability to find products by enhancing descriptions, attributes, categories, and extended text of your inventory items.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 15 minutes for newly entered data to become searchable as the system re-indexes the tables in the background.

When it finds the items, the agent checks the items' availability by analyzing multiple parameters, such as required quantity, delivery date, location, scheduled and planned receipts and more.

## Agent process flow

### Partcipants

Processing a sales quote request into an order involves three participants:

- Customer who requests a sales quote via email.

    Here's an example of an email:

    > Hello,
    >
    > We are in the process of purchasing furniture for our lodge, and after reviewing your website I would like to request a quote for the following items:
    >
    > - 2 Antwerp tables
    > - 4 Berlin chairs
    > - 4 Rome chairs
    >
    > Could you please provide a sales quote? We will need the items delivered by March 2nd. Additionally, please note our purchase order number: DC1011234.
    >
    > Thank you,
    >
    > [Name]

- Sales order agent, which monitors the mailbox, handles the incoming request, and creates the quote and order
- Business Central user who reviews agent tasks

### General flow

The general flow is illustrated in the figure, which is followed by more details of the steps. The actual flow might vary depending on factors such as follow-up requests, changes or cancellations in review, blocking issues, and so on.

# Pick items for warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table. To learn more about shipping items, go to [Shipping Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse pick processing and warehouse shipment processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the warehouse shipment.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where the person processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page to make the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

> [!NOTE]  
> Picking for a warehouse shipment of items that are assembled for a sales order follows the same steps as for regular warehouse picks for shipments, as described in this article. However, the number of pick lines for the quantity to ship may be many to one because you pick the components, not the assembled item.  
>
> Warehouse pick lines are created for the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the lines of the assembly order that's linked to the sales order line being shipped. All components are picked in one action. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).  
>  
> To learn more about picking components for assembly orders, including situations where assembly items aren't related to a sales shipment, go to [Pick for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list will include all shipments that have been released for picking, including those for which pick instructions have already been created. Documents with pick lines that have been completely picked and registered are not shown in this list.  
3. Select the shipments for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you try to select a shipment or internal pick document for which you've already created instructions for all of its lines you'll get a message that says something like, "there is nothing to handle." To combine warehouse pick instructions that you've already created into one pick instruction, you must delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting and bin ranking opportunities exist. You can easily recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or sort in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field either manually, or by using the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-docking bins. This information is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.
6. If needed, edit the lines. You can also delete lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items will be shipped with the other items on the shipment, and the cross-dock bins will have space for more incoming items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you delete lines, they're only deleted from the worksheet. They aren't deleted from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick you are creating. Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Create separate pick documents for each customer (sale orders), vendor (purchase return orders), and location (transfer orders).|
    |Per Item|Create separate pick documents for each item on the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Create separate pick documents for each zone that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Bin|Create separate pick documents for each bin that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Create separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Specify how the pick documents are created by selecting from the following options.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that each cover no more than the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and completely picked.|
    |Do Not Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the Qty. to Handle field in the created pick lines empty.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they are created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create the pick according to your selections.  

## To pick items for a warehouse shipment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you specifically. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking is used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
        
    You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

You can now bring the items to the shipment dock and post the shipment, including the related source document, on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md).

# Set Up Multiple Interest Rates for Delayed Payment

You can use different interest rates for different periods for delayed payments in trade transactions. [!INCLUDE [multiple-interest-rates-def](includes/multiple-interest-rates-def.md)]

For example, a government specifies the maximum interest to be levied for a consumer. This interest rate can be changed twice a year on 01 January and 01 July. The interest rate between businesses (B2B) is agreed by the parties and there is no limit to that customer group. The announced rate is usually four percent more than the normal bank interest.

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.  

## To set up multiple interest rates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Finance Charge Terms** page, select the required finance term, and then choose the **Interest Rates** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the required reminder term, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
7. On the **Reminder Levels** page, for the relevant reminder levels, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  

When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.

# Set up work hours and service hours

Typically, a service management system tracks resource hours and service order status in order to forecast workloads and service needs. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in tools that you can customize to record this kind of information.  
  
After you set the default service hours of your company, you can calculate response times for service orders or send warnings or alerts when service calls come in. The alert feature is implemented together with the job scheduler.
  
As you work on a service order, update its status so that you can monitor progress. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order. For more information, see [Understanding Service Order and Repair Status](service-order-repair-status.md).

## To set up default service hours

You use the **Default Service Hours** page to set up the usual service working hours in your company. These service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes and to send response time warnings. The default service hours are used for service contracts unless you specify special service hours for a contract.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Service Hours**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you leave the lines on the **Default Service Hours** page empty, the default value is 24 hours, valid only for calendar working days.  
  
## To set up work hour templates

You can use the **Work Hour Template** page to set up templates that contain the working hours for different types of resources in your company. For example, you can create templates for full time technicians and part time technicians. You use work hour templates when you set capacity for resources. To learn more about setting capacity for a resource, go to [To set capacity for a resource](projects-how-setup-resources.md#to-set-capacity-for-a-resource).
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Hour Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
  
> [!Note]
> After you enter work hours for each day, the value in the **Total per Week** field is calculated automatically.  

## To set up contract specific service hours

You can use the **Service Hours** page to set up specific service hours for the customer that owns the service contract. Service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes that belong to the service contract.  
  
If you don't set up specific service hours for the service contract, the default service hours for service contracts are used.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract you want to set up specific service hours for, and choose **Service Hours**.  
4. To set up service hours based on default service hours, choose the **Copy Default Service Hours** action.  
5. Edit the fields in the service hours entries. Insert or delete entries to set up the service hours for the contract. The fields **Day**, **Starting Time** and **Ending Time** are required for each line.  
6. If you want the service hours to be valid from a specific date, fill in the **Starting Date** field.  
7. If you want the service hours to be valid on holidays, select the check box in the **Valid on Holidays** field.

# Set up and report Intrastat

All companies in the European Union must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. This is referred to as Intrastat Reporting. You use the **Intrastat Journal** page to complete periodic Intrastat reports.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

## Required and optional Setups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer cards and Vendor cards include a field, **Intrastat Partner Type**, that has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: *"" (blank)*, *Company*, and *Person*. The **Intrastat Partner Type** field has replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. **Partner Type** is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). **Intrastat Partner Type** is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, you can specify different values for the two fields, if you need to.
>
> However, note that if the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

Before you can use the Intrastat journal to report Intrastat information, there are several things you must set up:  

* **Intrastat Setup**: Intrastat Setup page is used to enable intrastat reporting and set defaults for it. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals) or both depending on thresholds set by your local regulations. You can also set default transaction types for regular and return documents, used for nature of transaction reporting.
* **Intrastat journal templates**: You must set up the Intrastat journal templates and batches you will use. Because Intrastat is reported monthly, you must create 12 Intrastat journal batches based on the same template.  
* **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have established numerical codes that classify items and services. You specify these codes on items.
* **Transaction nature codes**: Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions, such as ordinary purchase and sale, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all of the codes that apply to your country/region. You use these codes on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents, and when you process returns.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature code for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review and/or add new transaction nature codes in the **Transaction Types** page according to the requirements in your country. You should also review and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for private individual or non-VAT registered businesses customers in the relevant **Customer** page. If you are unsure about the correct intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

* **Transport methods**: There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods. **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not require these codes, however, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning.  
* **Transaction specifications**: Use these to supplement the descriptions from the transaction types.  
* **Country of origin**: Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country where it was significantly processed.
* **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import**: This is the VAT-ID number of the partner operator in the Member State of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among Member States, and allows Member States to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the Member State of import.

> [!NOTE]
> The business partner VAT-ID to use can differ, depending on the business circumstance. For example, the ID to use differs for scenarios such as chain sales, where a supplier sells a product to another country, and then that company resells the item to another business in the same country, triangular trade, and so on. If you are unsure about the correct VAT-ID to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

Optionally, you can also set up:

* **Areas**: Use these to supplement information about countries and regions.  
* **Entry/exit points**: Use these to specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. Heathrow Airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information will also be copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.  

### To set up Intrastat templates and batches

The Intrastat batch jobs include only item entries, and not general ledger entries. If you have general ledger entries that qualify for Intrastat reporting, you must enter them manually. For example, if you purchase a computer from another EU country or region, the computer is not placed in inventory, but is posted to a general ledger account. You must manually enter this type of entry in the Intrastat journal.  

You can export the entries to a file that you can send to your Intrastat authorities. You can also print a report, manually enter the information on the forms from your authorities, and then submit the information.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that you set up an Intrastat journal batch for each month.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.  
3. To create batches, choose the **Batches** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Statistics Period** field, enter the statistics period as a four-digit number, where the first two digits represent the year and the next two digits represent the month. For example, enter 1706 for June, 2017.

### To set up transport methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transport Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up which Intrastat report fields are mandatory

In some countries/regions, such as Spain and UK, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or some other values when sales are over a certain threshold. On the **Intrastat Setup** page, you can select to make **Intrastat Checklist Setup** to set mandatory fields on the **Intrastat Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
3. On the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page, select in the **Field Name** to pick Intrastat report field you want to make mandatory.

### Czechia

Specifically for Czech businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up commodity codes

All items that you buy or sell must have a commodity code.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Commodity Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To assign a commodity code to an item, go to the **Item Card** page, expand the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, and then enter the code in the **Commodity Code** field.

### Italy

Specifically for Italian businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up transaction nature codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transaction Nature Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> If you frequently use a particular transaction nature code, you can make it the default. To do this, go to the **Intrastat Setup** page, and choose the code.

## To report Intrastat

After you fill in the Intrastat journal, you can run the **Checklist report** action to make sure that all information in the journal is correct. Mandatory fields you have set in **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page that are missing values will be shown in Errors and warning fact box on the **Intrastat Journal** page. Afterward, you can print an Intrastat report as a form, or create a file to submit to the tax authority in your country/region.  

### To fill in Intrastat journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal** and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the journal batch.  
4. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher.  
5. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the Intrastat journal. You can edit the lines if needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The batch job retrieves only the entries that contain a country/region code for which an Intrastat code has been entered on the **Countries/Regions** page. Therefore, you must enter Intrastat codes for the country/region codes for which you will run the batch job. The batch job sets the **Partner VAT ID** field to *QV999999999999* for private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses (customers with the **Intrastat Partner Type** field set to *Person*), and it uses the value of the **Transaction Type** field on the posted item ledger entry or job ledger entry.

### To modify Intrastat journals lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. User filter pane to filter Intrastat Journal lines based on some criteria. For example, filter on **Partner VAT ID** fields with the value *QV999999999999*.
4. Choose **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) and select **Edit in Excel**
5. In Excel, modify the Intrastat journal lines that you filtered out. For example, modify **Transaction Type** field values.  
6. Publish the changes that you have made in Excel back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] versions that do not support [**Edit in Excel**](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel) for journals, you can create configuration packages to export and import Intrastat journal lines to Excel. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content.

### Report Intrastat on a form or a file

To get the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat – Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in. If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, choose the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or choose **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Prints Intrastat Journal** action.  
5. On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then specify whether this is a **Receipt** or a **Shipment**.  
6. Choose **Send to** to print the report.  

### Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file. Before creating the file, you can print a checklist that contains the same information that will be in the file.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or by choosing the **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Create File** action.  
5. On the batch job page, choose the **OK** button.  
6. Choose **Save**.  
7. Browse to the location where you want to save the file, enter the file name, and then choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When a line in the Intrastat report has a supplementary unit of measure, the weight of the item will not be shown, since this value is not required.

## Reorganize Intrastat journals

Because you must submit an Intrastat report every month, and you create a new journal batch for each report, you will eventually have many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically. You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
3. Choose the journal batches to be deleted, and then choose the **Delete** button.  

## Tariff numbers

In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish 8-digit item codes for various items. In order for item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, you must have entered the information about the tariff number in the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with and enter them in the **Tariff Numbers** page.

In the **Tariff Numbers** page, add all the codes that you use. You must enter the codes on the item card before you begin to post. When you have set up the codes, enter them in the **Tariff No.** field on the item card. You must also fill in the **Net Weight** field on the item card.

# Import Multiple Item Pictures
You can import multiple item pictures in one go. Simply name your picture files with names corresponding to your item numbers, compress them to a zip file, and then use the Import Item Pictures page to manage which item pictures to import.

All common file formats are supported.

## To name picture files by the item names and prepare the ZIP file
1. At the location where your item pictures are stored, name each files according to the number of the related item. For example:

    |Item No.|File Name|
    |-|-|
    |1000|1000.bmp|
    |1001|1001.bmp|
    |1002|1002.bmp|

2. Collect all the files in a ZIP file. For example, in Windows Explorer, select the files, and then choose **Send to**, **Compressed (zipped) folder**.     

## To import item pictures
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Import Item Pictures** action.
3. In the **Select a ZIP file** field, select the relevant ZIP folder, and then choose the **Open** button.

    A line for each item and picture is created on the **Import Item Pictures** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For item cards that already have a picture, the **Picture Already Exists** check box is selected. If you do not want any existing pictures to be replaced, deselect the **Replace Pictures** check box. If you do not want individual existing pictures to be replaced, delete the lines in question.

3. Choose the **Import Pictures** action.

The **Import Status** field is updated to show if the picture import was skipped or completed.

To use the sustainability value chain features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Sustainability setup  

You need to specify some settings for the sustainability value chain functionality, such as enabling the value chain features to work with sustainability features, and the areas you'll use and track.  

To configure these settings, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields related to the sustainability value chain. The following table describes the fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable sustainability value entries posting through the value chain operations, and the availability of these fields in operational documents and journals. If you don't enable this field, sustainability features aren't available on operational documents, orders, or journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **G/L Account Card** page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **Item Charge** page.</br></br> **Important:** This field isn't currently supported. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that selecting the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field doesn't activate the sustainability value chain features. The field only enables you to record emissions in purchase documents. If you want to use purchase documents in value chain operations, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Item Charge** functionality currently isn't supported in the sustainability value chain process. We plan to add this feature in 2025 release wave 2.  

## Emission fees  

To use the sustainability value chain features, you must configure carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The value chain works only for CO2e, and not each type of greenhouse gas (GHG). You set up CO2e on the **Emission Fees** page.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the GHG emission you want to configure. This field is mandatory.
3. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** field specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential (GWP). If the **Emission Type** is **CO2**, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always **1**. You can't change this value because CO2 is the reference gas used to calculate the GWP of other greenhouse gases. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to **1**. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following example shows how to calculate the carbon equivalent factor. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to enter is 0.00336.  

To learn how track internal carbon fees or use other features related to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), go to [Set up sustainability in Business Central](finance-sustainability-setup.md).

# Managing contacts

Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that might develop into formal relationships. All such external contacts and their detailed information should be recorded in the system so that communication is more successful and so they can easily be converted to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

Use the **Contacts** list to manage your contacts. From there, you can create opportunities and manage other interactions with individual contacts. You can also see statistics about a contact, and you can access a range of reports. For information about how to find the right contact in the list, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md) .  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Manage inventory

For each physical product you trade in, you must create an item card of the **Inventory** type. Items you offer to customers but don't keep in inventory you can register as catalog items, which you can convert to inventory items when necessary. You can increase or decrease the quantity of an item in inventory by posting directly to the item ledger entries, such as after a physical count or if you don't record purchases.

Inventory increases and decreases are naturally also recorded when you post purchase and sales documents, respectively. To learn more, go to [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md), and [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). Transfers between locations change inventory quantities across your company's warehouses.

To enhance your overview of items and to help you find them, you can categorize items and give them attributes to search and sort by.

> [!NOTE]
> The physical handling of items is referred to as warehouse activities. Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

Planning for items to fulfill demand is covered as part of supply planning functionality. Learn more at [Planning](production-planning.md).

| Explore built-in inventory reports. | [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md) |

## Inventory reconciliation

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change in inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs are automatically posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger. For each inventory transaction you post, the appropriate values are posted to the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).

Even though inventory costs are automatically posted to the general ledger, it's still necessary to ensure that the costs of goods are forwarded to the related outbound sales transaction, especially in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. This is referred to as cost adjustment. Item costs are automatically adjusted when you post item transactions, but you can also adjust item costs manually. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

# Convert service contracts that include VAT amounts

Because the VAT rate change tool can't convert service contracts, these contracts must be converted manually. This article describes several alternative methods that you can use for service contract conversion.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This article provides a high-level workflow.  

 The following procedure describes how to correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract that has been created a year in advance.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For this example, you must change your work date to 01.01.2017.  

## To correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contract Management**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Under **Lists**, choose **Service Contracts**.  
3. Create a new prepaid service contract. Enter a start date of **01.01.2017** and an invoice period year for customer **20000**.  
4. To sign the contract, choose the **Sign Contract** action.  
5. Create a service invoice.
6. The invoice is listed as an unposted service invoice. To view the service invoice, choose the **Service** action, choose the **Contract Management** action, and then choose the **Service Invoices** action.  
7. Post the service invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't change the unposted service invoice. Since the service ledger entries are created when the invoice is created, a change in the unposted invoice will not change the already created service ledger entries. However, the VAT entries are created when the invoice is posted. This lets you change the general product posting group and the GSP product posting group on the unposted service invoice.  

### To create a credit memo for VAT difference 
 
The following procedure describes how to create a credit memo that only includes the VAT difference for the already invoiced period starting on **01.07.2017**. In this example, the VAT amount is only posted to the Financial Management module, not to the Service Management module. The VAT entries that are linked to the service ledger entry won't be corrected.  

1. Create a new general ledger account for the VAT difference. This account is used for direct posting of the VAT correction.  
2. Add a new line to the VAT posting setup.  

## To create contract expiration dates in contract lines  

The following procedure describes how to create new contracts by working with contract expiration dates in service contract lines.  

1. On the **Service Contract** page, set the contract expiration date to **30.06.2017**.  
2. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action to automatically create a credit memo for July 2017 to December 2017.  
3. Because the contract has expired, you need to create a new contract for the period with the new VAT rate for July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  

### To create a new credit memo  

The following procedure describes how to create a new credit memo using the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job. Entries that you don't want to correct from January 2017 to June 2017 will be deleted.  

1. Run the VAT rate change tool on July 1, 2017. The general product posting group or the VAT product posting group is changed. For more information, see [Work with VAT on Sales and Purchases](finance-work-with-vat.md).  
2. After running the VAT rate change tool, enter a contract expiration date for the service contract. You can now delete the service contract line and create a new line that is identical to the old one.  
3. Create a new invoice for the period of January 2017 to December 2012 using the new VAT rate.  
4. To create another credit memo, on the **Service Credit Memos** page, choose the **New** action to create a new service credit memo.  
5. Choose the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** action.  
6. After the conversion is complete, VAT and service ledger entries will be correct.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item card, and variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> Although you can assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares aren't available on SKUs. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)

# Tell Me FAQ

This article answers questions that our advanced users often ask about the Tell me what you want to do feature.

## Are all actions from my current page discoverable in Tell Me?

No. Actions in parts, such as the Sales Lines part or FactBoxes, aren't displayed in Tell Me.

## Can I search for a specific record?

Yes. For example, if you want to quickly find a sales order, enter it's identifier, and then choose the **Search company data** action. If you only know the customer's name, enter that. Tell Me arranges results by type, so you could find the order under the Sales Orders category.

## Are the results in Tell Me filtered by permissions?

If the user doesn't have AccessByPermissions, then actions aren't displayed. However, pages and reports appear in the results but require that the user has permission to access them. A message displays if the user doesn't have permission to view the object.

## Does Tell Me display content from my customizations or installed third-party extensions?

Actions, pages, and reports that originate from extensions are picked up by Tell Me. For technical information about how to make custom pages and reports discoverable, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality).

## What makes this different from what was previously known as Page Search?

Page Search has evolved into Tell Me to help you get work done quickly. Page Search could only help you navigate to pages or reports. At a technical level, Tell Me is no longer based on the legacy MenuSuite concept.

## I use on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Does that include Tell Me?

You can use Tell Me in the on-premises Web Client to find actions, pages, and reports, but not apps and consulting services on AppSource.

## Is Tell Me available for all form factors?

Yes. It was introduced on phones and tablets in Business Central 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, it must be enabled in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) using the **Feature: Search for pages and data in the mobile app** switch. In 2024 rlease wave 1 and later, it's always enabled.

<!-- removed in v20 because of Help pane
### Are the documentation results available in any language?
The help articles display in the language you have specified in **My Settings**, if help is available in that language.
-->

## Does Tell Me give me help on how to use pages, reports, and other things?

No, but you can easily get this information from the Help pane. Just select the **Search Help** action in the **Tell me what you want to do** page or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard. To learn more about the Help pane, go to [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane).

### Why don't I see a bookmark icon for my search results?

The bookmark icon isn't displayed in the Tell Me window when personalization is disabled for a user role.

# Design Details: Item Tracking in the Warehouse
Serial number and lot number handling is primarily a warehouse task and therefore all inbound and outbound warehouse documents have standard functionality for assigning and selecting item tracking numbers.  

However, because the reservation system is based on item ledger entries, warehouse activity documents that register only warehouse entries are not fully supported. Because reservations and item tracking numbers can be handled only at the location level, not at the bin and zone level, the **Item Tracking Lines** page cannot be opened from warehouse activity documents. The same applies to the **Reservation** page.  

After a serial or lot number has been added to an item at a warehouse location, it can be moved and reclassified freely within the warehouse by using an independent item tracking structure that is unrelated to the reservation system. **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are accessed directly on warehouse document lines. When the serial or lot number later partakes in outbound posting, it is synchronized with the reservation system as a part of ordinary bin adjustment. For more information, see [Design Details: Integration with Inventory](design-details-integration-with-inventory.md).  

However, the reservation system does take warehouse activities into consideration when it calculates availability. For example, items that are allocated to picks, or registered as picked, cannot be reserved. For more information, see [Design Details: Warehouse Availability](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

# Put items away with warehouse put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table, and assumes that receiving has already happened. Learn more at [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse put-away processing and warehouse receive processing, use warehouse put-away documents to control how items are put away. When you post a warehouse receipt, source documents such as purchase, inbound transfer, or sales return orders, are updated. The quantity received is posted to the item ledger, and the lines for the received items are sent to the put-away function in the warehouse.

Depending on the value in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field on the **Location card**, the lines are either made available to the put-away worksheet or used to generate put-away documents immediately. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In addition to the standard ways to create warehouse put-aways that this article describes, you can create put-aways from the related posted warehouse receipt. This is useful if you have deleted put-away lines, or if you decide not to use the put-away worksheet, because you can create or recreate put-away instructions from the posted receipt lines.

## Zone and bin codes

At locations that are set up to use directed put-away and pick, the following settings are required to determine the best place to put the items:  

* A put-away template is set up. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).  
* The weight, cubage, and special storage requirements of the item or stock-keeping unit are defined.
* The capacity, bin type, and bin ranking are defined for the bins.  

The bin ranking is used when more than one bin matches the criteria on the put-away template. If both the put-away template criteria and the bin ranking are the same for more than one bin, the bin with the highest number is selected.

## To create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet  

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

You can create put-away documents for multiple receipts at the same time on the **Put-away Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action. The **Put-away Selection** page opens.  

    The list contains all posted receipts that are ready to be put away, including those for which put-away instructions have already been created. Documents with put-away lines that have been completely put away and registered are not shown on this list.  
3. Select the documents that you want to work on. You can work on lines from several documents at the same time.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a receipt or internal put-away document for which you've already created instructions for all lines, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] informs you that there's nothing to handle.  

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the put-away instruction. However, the same opportunities for sorting and bin ranking exist. You can recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the put-away instructions or sort in the put-away instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  
6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can delete lines, for example, if some items need to be put away in a bin that's far away from the bins for the other items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you delete lines they're only deleted from this worksheet. They aren't deleted from the put-away selection.  

7. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. The **Create Document** page opens, where you can add more information to the put-away you're creating.  

    * You can assign the put-away to a specific employee.  
    * You can sort the put-away instruction lines as you did in the worksheet or by bin ranking. When you sort according to bin ranking, the *Take* lines appear first, because most receipt bins have a 0 bin ranking. The *Place* lines appear last, starting with the bins with the lowest bin ranking. If you have structured your warehouse so bins of similar bin ranking are side by side, sorting lines in this way will save steps for warehouse employees.  
    * You can choose not to include the lines that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created when it converted a large unit of measure to smaller units of measure by selecting the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field. Learn more about breakbulk at [Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-enable-automatic-breaking-bulk-with-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).  
    * You can choose not to have the **Qty. to Handle** field automatically filled in on the put-away instructions.  
    * You can choose to print the document immediately.  

8. Choose **OK** to create the put-away.  

## To create a put-away from a posted receipt

If a location uses both put-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put-away lines, or if you use directed put-away and pick and have decided not to use the put-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put-away instructions for the posted receipt lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a posted receipt to put away.  
3. Choose the **Card** action.  

    If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates whether the receipt is partially or completely put-away.  

4. If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, choose the **Create Put-away** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.  

## To put items away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.

2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If your warehouse requires, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    You can sort the put-away lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the actions.

    If a bin code is mandatory for the locations, each receipt line becomes at least two lines in the warehouse put-away, as follows.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# Financial Information Quick Start

After entering basic company information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the next steps is completing the financial section. You do this not only to receive or make payments, but also to properly manage and report your business' numbers.

## The chart of accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) offers an overview of the company's finances, listing accounts in structured groups such as assets, liabilities, income, cost of goods sold, and expenses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts you can customize to your business' accounting practices.

## Set up the chart of accounts

The following video shows how to set up the chart of accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br /><br />

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

### Add an account to the chart of accounts

To add an account not included by default in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]—for example, gardening services—just follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open the **G/L Account Card** page.

# Moving Averages (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Moving Averages* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Amount Average 30D**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Manufacturing app gives insights into your manufacturing activities. Its detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data help:

- Streamline manufacturing processes
- Improve decision-making at all levels of the organization
- Optimize production efficiency

## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization

COOs need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently you're using your resources and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process, and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.

## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: improving resource usage

Manufacturing managers ensure that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-average-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates them by work center. This report can help you catch unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example scenario: tracking production lines

Manufacturing supervisors ensure that goods and materials flow smoothly through the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report shows the use of work centers in real-time, which helps you spot bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underused. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical use of work centers and find trends and patterns. This report helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This report helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

# Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs

When running reports, users are typically presented with a page that lets them select options and set filters to change the data that is included in the generated report. This page is called the *request page*. A report can include one or more *saved settings* that users can apply to the report from the request page. *Saved settings* are basically predefined options and filters. Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. For more information, see [Use saved settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to *reports*, but similar information applies to *batch jobs*.

If you have the proper permissions, you can view, create, and modify the saved settings for all reports for all users in a company. You can assign saved settings for a report to individual users or to all users in the company.

## Manage saved settings

You manage saved settings on the **Reports Settings** page. There are two ways to open this page:

- Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Settings**, and then choose the related link.
- In a report's request page, choose the lookup in the **Use default values from** field, and then choose the **Select from full list** action.

    This field is only visible if you have run the report at least once earlier. The list will only show settings that are available to you, either because they are your own settings, or because the settings are shared with you.

The **Report Settings** page displays all the existing saved settings entries for all users. If there is a user name in the **Assigned to** field, only that user can use the saved settings for the associated report. If there is a check mark in the **Share with all users** field, all users can use the saved settings for the report.  

> [!TIP]
> When a user has run a report that supports shared settings, their settings are saved and added to this list. In most cases, the admin can then edit those settings and choose to share the settings with all users.
>
> However, in some cases, settings cannot be shared, and the admin cannot change them either. Most batch jobs do not support shared settings.  

## Create or modify saved settings for all users

From the **Report Settings** page, you can:

- Choose the **New** action to create a new saved settings entry from scratch.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Copy** action to create a copy.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Edit** action to modify a saved settings entry.

> [!Important]
> Consider the name that you give a saved settings entry. If you create a saved settings entry for all users, and you give it the same name as an existing saved settings entry that is assigned to a specific user only, then that user will not be able to use the saved settings entry that is assigned to everyone.  In the **Saved Settings** section on the request page, the user will see two saved settings entries with the same name. However, no matter which option they choose, the user-specific saved settings entry will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to save settings is available only on reports where the [SaveValues property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-savevalues-property) of the report's request page is set to **Yes**. The **SaveValues** property is set by the developer.

title: Allocation Status and Repair Status | Microsoft Docs
description: Learn about the relationship between the repair status of service items and the allocation status of the allocation entries for them.
author: brentholtorf

# Allocation Status and Repair Status of Service Items
The repair status of service items and the allocation status of the allocation entries for the service items have a certain relationship in Service Management. The allocation status changes when you change the repair status of the service item to **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** and when you convert a service quote to a service order. The repair status of the service item changes when you cancel the service item allocation or reallocate the service item to another resource. You can view the repair status of service items on the **Service Tasks** page and you can update the repair status in the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can view the allocation status in the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocations** page.  
  
## Changing Repair Status  
When you change the repair status of a service item on a service item line, there is a search for a corresponding allocation entry for this service item that has the status **Active**. If such an allocation entry is found, the status is updated in one of the following ways:  
  
* If you change the repair status to **Finished**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If you change the repair status to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some of the service has been completed, or **Referred**, that is, no service has been done, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
* When a service order allocation entry is created that indicates that no resource has been allocated, the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocation** page is set to **Nonactive**.  
* The allocation entry status is set to **Canceled** when you reallocate the referred service item in the service order allocation entry, which indicates that the allocated resource or resource group has not attempted the service task.  
  
The allocation status reflects when the service process is finished, or when another resource is necessary in order to finish the service of the service item.  
  
## Converting Service Quotes to Service Orders  
When you convert a service quote to a service order, the service order, the service items in the order and their allocation entries are updated in the following ways:  
  
* The repair status of the service items is changed to **Initial**.  
* The service order status is changed to **Pending**.  
* There is a search for allocation entries for all the service items in the service order that have the status **Active**. If such allocation entries are found, their allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
  
## Canceling Allocations  
When you cancel an allocation for a service item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the allocation status of the corresponding allocation entry from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.

The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
## Reallocating an Active Allocation Entry  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that is **Active**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Canceled**.  
  
The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the same way as if you had canceled the allocation:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
A new allocation entry that contains the new resource is created that has the status **Active**.  
  
## Reallocating a Service Item  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that has the status **Reallocation Needed**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
  
A new allocation entry that contains the new resource is created that has the status **Active**.

# Setting up inventory

Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

After you set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Set up resources for projects

To correctly manage resource activities, you must set up your resources and the related costs and prices. The project-related prices, discounts, and cost factor rules are set up on the project card. You can specify the costs and prices for individual resources, resource groups, or all available resources of the company.

You specify the default amount per hour when you set up a resource. The price and cost amounts apply when you use or sell resources in a project. For example, if you use a specific machine for five hours, the calculation is based on the amount per hour.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't purchase external resources for a specific project. We recommend that you use items of the type Service instead.

## To set up a resource

Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up a resource group

You can combine several resources in one resource group. All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources. You can also enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set capacity for a resource

To calculate how much time a resource can spend on projects, you must set their capacity. Capacity represents a resource's available time for a period on the work calendar. This setup is used when you fill in project planning lines that contain the resource. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant resource card, and then choose the **Resource Capacity** action.
3. On the **Resource Capacity** page, in the **View By** field, specify the length of the period, such as **Day**, that is shown on columns on the **Resource Capacity Matrix** FastTab.
4. For each resource on a line, specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available.
5. Alternatively, to detail the resource's capacity for a specific period, choose the **Set Capacity** action.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're setting capacity for a group of people who typically work the same hours, you can save a little time and ensure consistency by choosing a work hour template. For example, you might have one work hour template for full time technicians, and another for technicians that work part time. To learn more about work hour templates, go to [To set up work hour templates](service-how-setup-work-service-hours.md#to-set-up-work-hour-templates).

6. On the **Resource Capacity Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
7. Choose the **Update Capacity** action. The **Resource Capacity** page is updated with the entered capacity.
8. Close the page.

## To set up alternate resource costs

In addition to the cost specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate costs for each resource. For example, if you pay an employee a higher hourly rate for overtime, you can set up a resource cost for the overtime rate. The alternate cost that you set up for the resource overrides the cost on the resource card when you use the resource in the resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate costs for, and then choose the **Costs** action.  
3. On the **Resource Costs** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.  
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up resource costs that apply to all resources and resource groups, open the **Resource Costs** page and fill in the fields.

## To set up alternate resource prices

In addition to price specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate prices for each resource. These alternate prices can be conditional. They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific project or work type.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate prices for, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. On the **Resource Prices** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up.

## To adjust resource prices

If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job doesn't create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment takes effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on existing alternate prices

If you already set up alternate resource prices for some resources, you can use a batch job to set up multiple alternate resource prices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Price)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, the **Resource Price Changes** page shows the results of the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on standard prices

If you want to set up multiple alternate resource prices based on the standard prices on the resource cards, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Res.)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, open the **Resource Price Changes** page to see the results of the batch job.

### Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for resources at the same time, enable the **Enable multiple users to post resource ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Set up or change the Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before executing the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, your customers can pay you through their account with payment services, such as PayPal or WorldPay.  

After you enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a link to the service is available on sales documents that you send by email to your customers. Customers can use the link to go to the payment service and pay the bill, directly from the sales document. If you don't want to include the link, for example, if a customer will pay with cash, you can remove the payment service from the invoice before posting.  

The PayPal Payments Standard and WorldPay Payments Standard extensions are installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and are ready for you to enable.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is market as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.   

## To enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the payment service, and then close the page.  
4. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **Setup** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Close the page.  

## To select a payment service on a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to pay by using the payment service.  
3. In the **Payment Service** field, choose the payment service.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Payment Service** field is available only if you've enabled the payment service.

# Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dataverse

You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronization jobs synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are coupled. For records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronization direction and rules, the synchronization jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system.

There are several synchronization jobs that are available out-of-the-box. The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job.
2. VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job.
3. CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job.
4. CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job.
5. SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job.

You can view the jobs on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Default synchronization job queue entries

The following table describes the default synchronization jobs for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

| Job Queue Entry | Description | Direction | Integration Table Mapping | Default Synchronization Frequency (mins) | Default inactivity sleep time (mins) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contacts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. | Bidirectional | CONTACT | 30 | 720 <br>(12 hours) |
| CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] transaction currencies with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currencies. | From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | CURRENCY | 30 | 720 <br> (12 hrs) |
| CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | CUSTOMER | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | VENDOR | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] salespeople with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] users. | From [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | SALESPEOPLE | 30 | 1440<br> (24 hrs) |

## Synchronization process

Each synchronization job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize.  

To synchronize data, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronization jobs, or let the synchronization jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you are using the synchronization job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

- The **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box controls whether new records are created when you synchronize. By default, the check box is selected, which means that only records that are coupled will be synchronized. In the integration table mapping, you can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table so that the integration synchronization jobs will create new records in the destination database for each row in the source database that is not coupled. For more information, see [Creating New Records](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

    **Example**
    If you clear the **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box, when you synchronize customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a new account is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and automatically coupled. Additionally, because the synchronization is bidirectional in this case, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronized. For more information, go to [Synchronization Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

- When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the row type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] depending on the synchronization direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

- With subsequent synchronizations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronization job for the table will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- With bidirectional synchronization, the job synchronizes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## About inactivity timeouts

Some job queue entries, such as those that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], use the **Inactivity Timeout** field on the **Job Queue Entry** page to prevent the job queue entry from running unnecessarily.  

:::image type="content" source="media/on-hold-with-inactivity-timeout.png" alt-text="Flowchart for when job queue entries are put on hold due to inactivity.":::

When the value in this field is not zero, and the job queue did not find any changes during the last run, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the job queue entry on hold. When that happens, the **Status of Job Queue** field will show **On Hold Due to Inactivity**, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will wait for the period of time specified in **Inactivity Timeout** field before it runs the job queue entry again.  

For example, by default, the CURRENCY job queue entry, which synchronizes currencies in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with exchange rates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will look for changes to exchange rates every 30 minutes. If no changes are found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the CURRENCY job queue entry on hold for 720 minutes (twelve hours). If an exchange rate is changed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while the job queue entry is on hold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically reactivate the job queue entry and restart the job queue. 

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically activate job queue entries that are on hold only when changes happen in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Changes in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will not activate job queue entries.

# Work with catalog items

Catalog items are items that you don't manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] until you sell them. When you use the **Select Catalog Item** action to add a catalog item to a line on a sales order, quote, or blanket sales order, the catalog item is converted to a regular item.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't select a catalog item from the **Sales Invoice** page.

A catalog item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. Before you can convert a catalog item to a normal item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to your item numbering. To learn more about item numbering, go to [Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering](#specify-how-catalog-item-numbers-are-converted-to-your-own-numbering).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalog items are not to be mistaken with non-inventory items, which are regular items that are given the type **Non-Inventory** to keep them out of availability and costing calculations, for example, because they are only used internally and have a low cost. To learn move about non-inventory items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

## Create a catalog item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Catalog Items** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering

Before you can convert a catalog item to a regular item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to the structure you use for item numbers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Item Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **No. Format** field, choose the option you prefer.

## Convert a catalog item to a normal item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a catalog item that you want to convert to a normal item.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, choose the **Create Item** action.

A new item card prefilled with information from the catalog item and an item template is created. You can edit the information about the new item if needed. To learn more about creating items, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> An item reference is automatically created between the vendor's item number and your new item number. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

## To sell a catalog item and convert it to a normal item

The following process uses a sales order, but the steps are the same for blanket sales orders and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as for any sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3. On a new sales line, in the **Type** field, select **Item**, but leave the **No.** field empty.
4. Choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Select Catalog Items** action.
5. On the **Catalog Items** page, select the catalog item that you want to sell, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The catalog item automatically converts to a normal item, and the new normal item is selected on the sales line.
6. When the sales order is complete, choose the **Post** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change you mind and delete the sales line, the automatically created item is also deleted. Deleting the item helps reduce clutter in you list of items.
>
> The item is also deleted if you convert the item manually, or make changes such as adding new units of measure or updating prices or cost. However, the item won't be deleted if it's already used in sales or purchase lines, assembly BOMs, or has ledger entries.

# Warehouse management overview

There are two things that are important to all businesses that physically move goods in and out of their warehouse:

* They have an overview of inventory levels and item placement in the warehouse.
* They can quickly and accurately receive, pick, and ship items.

To help businesses achieve those things, warehouse features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add the following capabilities to inventory management:

* Bins
* Warehouse shipments
* Inventory picks
* Movement worksheet

Implement these features in different combinations to tailor your warehouse processes for your business. Allow for increasing complexity as your company grows and your processes change.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important to choose options that improve your processes without causing overhead. The following table gives an overview of typical configurations for dealing with physical goods.

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Example of Inbound Flow|Example of Outbound Flow|Example of Internal Flow|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase order|Sales order| Production order -> Consumption journal|  
|Basic|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|**Require Receipt**<br>**Require Ship**.|Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Order(s) -> Warehouse Receipt|Sales Order -> Warehouse Shipment|Same as above.|
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Put-away or Require Pick. </br><br/> Production, Assembly, Projects: Inventory Pick, Inventory Movement, Inventory Put-Away </br></br>**NOTE**: You can still post receipts, shipments, consumption, output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings.|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase Order -> Inventory Put-away|Sales Order -> Inventory Pick|Production Order -> Inventory Pick|
|Advanced|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.<br /><br />Consolidated pick/put-away activities for multiple source documents.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Receive + Require Put-away,</br> Require Ship + Require Pick</br></br> Production, Assembly, Projects: Warehouse Pick |Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Order(s) -> Warehouse Receipt -> Warehouse Put-away|Sales Order(s) -> Warehouse Shipment(s) -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Pick(s)| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Pick(s) -> Consumption journal|
|Advanced|Same as above + Directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above.|Same as above.| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Pick(s) Consumption journal|

Complexity increases with the size of your organization and how many departments and people are involved. A process can be simple, for example, when the same person creates and posts a sales document. Processes can also be more complex, and involve several steps and people. The following steps are an example of a more complex process:

1. An order processor creates a sales order.
1. A warehouse manager creates pick instructions.
1. A warehouse employee finishes the flow by posting the warehouse shipment.

The level of complexity is also affected by the types of documents you use in your warehouse activities. For example, you can use warehouse receipt and warehouse put-away documents for your inbound flow, but use inventory pick documents for your outbound flow.

Another factor that impacts complexity is how your physical warehouse is represented in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Modeling the physical warehouse](#modeling-the-physical-warehouse).

## Modeling the physical warehouse

You have several options for representing the real-world setup of your warehouse in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Your choices determine how you work with warehouse features.

The placement of items can be shelves, locations, or bins, and there are pros and cons for each option.

### Locations and bins

To handle physical goods, you must have at least one location. You can use multiple locations or use bins to model your warehouse and organizational structure.

Typically, locations are the preferred way to organize operations that are distributed across geographic areas. In some cases, however, you might want to create several locations that are located at the same place. Using locations has the following advantages:

* Grant access by using the **Warehouse Employee** and **Responsibility Centers** pages.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. Learn more at [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Specify default dimensions and use different inventory posting setups.
* Set up planning parameters. Learn more at [Planning parameters](production-about-planning-functionality.md#planning-parameters).  
* Use different warehouse features for each location.

### Shelves and bins

If you always store an item in the same place, you can use the **Shelf No.** field on the **Item Card** or **Stock-keeping Unit Card** pages. This field can be a basic manual storage system in environments without bins. The field's value is copied from the item card to document lines and reports, but it's only informational. The value isn't used in warehouse activities or availability calculations.

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and are used to make suggestions about the placement of items:

* One or more fixed bins for an item.
* Bins for specific operations, such as a shipping bin or a production output bin.
* Bin capacity and weight restrictions (for directed put-away and pick only).
* Bin rating (for directed put-away and pick only).

## Typical warehouse workflow

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|In a basic flow on an order-by-order basis, use an inventory put-away to record the receipt of items at locations, including any over-receipt. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the receipt, use a warehouse receipt.|[Inbound flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md)|

## Terminology related to warehouse management

### Complexity levels

We use the terms "basic" and "advanced" to differentiate between levels of complexity. This simple differentiation covers several levels of complexity in location setups, each supported by different warehouse documents. The most advanced level of warehousing is referred to as "Directed put-away and pick." To use directed put-away and pick for a location, turn on the **directed put-away and pick** toggle on the **Location Card** page.

### Warehouse flows

* Inbound flow - Move items into the warehouse location and make them available, such as purchases and inbound transfers.
* Outbound flow - Pick and ship items to customers or other locations.
* Internal flow - Handle items within a location. For example, move components to production or count physical inventory.

### Basic documents  

The following documents are used in basic warehouse flows.

* Inventory Put-away
* Inventory Pick
* Inventory Movement
* Item Journal
* Item Reclassification Journal

### Advanced documents  

The following documents are used in advanced warehouse flows.

* Warehouse Receipt
* Put-away Worksheet
* Warehouse Put-away
* Pick Worksheet
* Warehouse Pick
* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Movement
* Internal Warehouse Pick
* Internal Warehouse Put-away
* Bin Creation Worksheet
* Bin Content Creation Worksheet
* Warehouse Item Journal
* Warehouse Item Reclassification Journal

### Pages and settings

This section describes the concepts behind the key pages and settings for warehousing.

#### Bins and bin content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It's the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as *bin contents*. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

Bin contents can be **Fixed**, **Dedicated**, or **Default** to define how to use the bin content. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as *floating* bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code. The fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin is emptied, the bin content doesn't disappear. You can select the bin again as soon as its contents are replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource that uses the bin. For example, a machine center. Other non-pick content, such as outbound quantities on a shipment posting, can be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **Default** bin property to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At locations that use directed put-away and pick, the default bin property isn't used. At locations where bins are required, the property specifies where to place items in inbound flows. In outbound flows, the property specifies where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If outbound items are placed in several bins, items are taken from the non-default bins first, to empty that bin content, and the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

You can have one default bin per item per location.  

#### Bin type

Locations that use directed put-away and pick can use bin types. Bin types control the activities that you allow for a bin. 

The following types of bins are available:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items that are received but aren't put away.|  
|SHIP|Items that are picked for warehouse shipment lines but aren't posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to store in large units of measure but that you don't want to access for picking purposes. These bins aren't used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, so their use might be limited. This type of bin is useful when you purchase a large quantity of items. The bins should always have a low bin-ranking, so that items with higher-ranking PUTPICK bins are put away first. Regularly replenish this type of bin so that their items are available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. You can only use movements to replenishment of these bins, not put-aways.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both put-aways and picks. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. Set up your bulk storage bins with lower bin rankings than ordinary pick bins or bins in your forward picking area.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling checkboxes selected by default. Content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

You can operate your warehouse with all of the eight possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.
With the exceptions of the PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY types of bins, the bin type defines the activity allowed for a bin. For example, you can only use a RECEIVE type of bin to receive items or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use movements to move items to RECEIVE and QC bins. Similarly, use movements to move items from SHIP and QC bins.  

#### Bin ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how to collect items in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins. Items are suggested for picks and put-aways based on the bin ranks.

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Pick processes suggest items with the highest bin ranking from bin content first. Bin replenishment suggests lower-ranking bins before higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking and bin contents are the basic properties that guide warehouse employees in the warehouse.  

#### Bin setup

In advanced warehousing, you can specify the following capacity values to control how, and in which, bins you store items:

* Quantity
* Total cubage
* Weight  

You can assign a base unit of measure (UOM) to items. A base UOM might be pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also create larger UOMs based on your base UOM. For example, if pieces are your base UOM, a pallet might equal 16 pieces.  

If an item has more than one UOM, set the maximum quantity for every UOM on the item card. If you handle an item in pieces and pallets, the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin isn't calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item are set up on the item.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use multiple UOMs at locations that use directed put-away and pick. In all other configurations, you can only use bin contents in the base UOM. In transactions with a UOM that's larger than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

#### Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed for locations.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or more bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone are assigned to the bins that are created for the zone.  

#### Warehouse class

In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to the following entities: 

* Items
* Bins
* Zones

Warehouse classes control where to store items. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, you might store items in the receiving zone as frozen, hazardous, or another class.

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually choose the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code doesn't match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins aren't assigned, then the quantity can't be received.  

#### Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant. Inventory is often organized in bins and zones.

#### First expired first out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** checkbox on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the **Location Card** page, item-tracked items are picked at the location according to their expiration date. Items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items have serial or lot numbers assigned. If some, but not all, of the quantity on the line has serial or lot numbers assigned, the remaining quantity is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to the temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

Learn more at [Enable Picking Items by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).

#### Put-away template

Put-away templates specify a set of prioritized rules that apply when you create put-aways. For example, a put-away template can require you to place items in a bin with bin content that has the same UOM. If a similar bin with enough capacity can't be found, the item must be placed in an empty bin. You assign a put-away template to an item and a location.

# Design Details: Cost Adjustment

The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients, according to an item’s costing method, to provide correct inventory valuation.  

An item can be sales invoiced before it has been purchase invoiced, so that the recorded inventory value of the sale does not match the actual purchase cost. Cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold (COGS) for historic sales entries to ensure that they match the costs of the inbound transactions to which they are applied. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

The following are secondary purposes, or functions, of cost adjustment:  

* Invoice finished production orders:  

  * Change the status of value entries from **Expected** to **Actual**.  
  * Clear WIP accounts. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).  
  * Post variance. For more information, see [Design Details: Variance](design-details-variance.md).  
  * Update the unit cost on the item card.  

Inventory costs must be adjusted before the related value entries can be reconciled with the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Detecting the Adjustment

The task of detecting if cost adjustment should occur is primarily performed by the Item Jnl.-Post Line routine, while the task of calculating and generating cost adjustment entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

To be able to forward costs, the detection mechanism determines which sources have changed in costs and to which destination these costs should be forwarded. The following three detection functions exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Item Application Entry  
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point  
* Order Level  

### Item Application Entry

This detection function is used for items that use FIFO, LIFO, Standard, and Specific costing methods and for fixed applications scenarios. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as *Applied Entry to Adjust* whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded according to the cost chains that are recorded in the **Item Application Entry** table.  

### Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point

This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking a record in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table whenever a value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date.  

### Order Level

This detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting. The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure:  

![Flow of entries in cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Flow of entries in cost adjustment")  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment

Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways:  

* Manually, by running the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can run this batch job either for all items or for only certain items or item categories. This batch job runs a cost adjustment for the items in inventory for which an inbound transaction has been made, such as a purchase. For items that use the average costing method, the batch job also makes an adjustment if any outbound transactions are created.  
* Automatically, by adjusting costs every time that you post an inventory transaction, and when you finish a production order. The cost adjustment is only run for the specific item or items affected by the posting. This is set up when you select the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page.  

It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate. The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often.  

Because it is important to keep the unit cost of an item up to date, it is recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job as often as possible, during nonworking hours. Alternatively, use automatic cost adjustment. This ensures that the unit cost is updated for items daily.  

Regardless if you run the cost adjustment manually or automatically, the adjustment process and its consequences are the same. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value of the inbound transaction and forwards that cost to any outbound transactions, such as sales or consumptions, which have been applied to the inbound transaction. The cost adjustment creates value entries that contain adjustment amounts and amounts that compensate for rounding.  

The new adjustment and rounding value entries have the posting date of the related invoice. Exceptions are if the value entries fall in a closed accounting period or inventory period or if the posting date is earlier than the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. If this occurs, the batch job assigns the posting date as the first date of the next open period.  

## Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you have the option to run the batch job for all items or for only certain items or categories.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job, or to fix the cost of a certain item.  

### Example

The following example shows if you post a purchased item as received and invoiced on 01-01-20. You later post the sold item as shipped and invoiced on 01-15-20. Then, you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** and **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch jobs. The following entries are created.  

#### Value Entries (1) 

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|10.00|10.00|1|1|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-10.00|-10.00|-1|2|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (1)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  

#### General Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-10.00|2|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-10.00|3|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|10.00|4|  

Later, you post a related purchase item charge for 2.00 LCY invoiced on 02-10-20. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job and then run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. The cost adjustment batch job adjusts the cost of the sale by -2.00 LCY accordingly, and the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job posts the new value entries to the general ledger. The result is as follows.  

#### Value Entries (2)  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Adjustment|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|  
|02-10-20|Purchase|2.00|2.00|0|No|3|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-2.00|-2.00|0|Yes|4|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (2)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|5|3|2|  
|6|3|2|  
|7|4|2|  
|8|4|2|  

#### General Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|02-10-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|2.00|5|  
|02-10-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-2.00|6|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-2.00|7|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|2.00|8|  

## Automatic Cost Adjustment

To set up cost adjustment to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, use the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. This field enables you to select how far back in time from the current work date that you want automatic cost adjustment to be performed. The following options exist.  

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Never|Costs are not adjusted when you post.|  
|Day|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date.|  
|Week|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date.|  
|Month|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date.|  
|Quarter|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date.|  
|Year|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date.|  
|Always|Costs are always adjusted when you post, regardless of the posting date.|  

The selection that you make in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field is important for performance and the accuracy of your costs. Shorter time periods, such as **Day** or **Week**, affect system performance less, because they provide the stricter requirement that only costs posted in the last day or week can be automatically adjusted. This means that the automatic cost adjustment does not run as frequently and therefore affects system performance less. However, it also means that unit costs may be less accurate.  

### Example

The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario:  

* On January 10, you post a purchased item as received and invoiced.  
* On January 15, you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced.
* On February 5, you receive an invoice for a freight charge on the original purchase. You post this freight charge, applying it to the original purchase invoice, which increases the cost of the original purchase.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a day or a week from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment does not run, and the cost of the purchase is not forwarded to the sale until you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

# Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook

You can set up contact synchronization so that your contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have the same information as your contacts in Microsoft Outlook. For example, if you're a sales person, you might work in Outlook and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the same time. If the contacts are the same in both places, your work is more straightforward.  

By default, the contacts you're syncing are kept in a **Business Central** folder in your Favorites on the Folder Pane in Outlook. The Business Central folder can make it easier to identify which contacts you're syncing. You can set filters to sync only specific contacts from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Outlook. After you've set up synchronization, you can synchronize manually or automate the process to synchronize on a scheduled basis.  

## Prerequisites

- You user profile in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must specify your Microsoft 365 email account.

  You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of your user profile in the **Users** list.
- With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you've set up contact synchronization as described in [Set Up Contact Synchronization with Outlook for Business Central On-premises](admin-contact-sync-setup-onprem.md)

## Set Up Synchronization

You set up how you want to synchronize contacts with Outlook on the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

On the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can validate that the connection to Exchange is working and then set up contact synchronization. From the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can open the **Contact Sync. Setup** page and start the synchronization. Optionally, set a filter to specify which contacts to synchronize. For example, you can filter on name, type, company, and so on. You can also change the default name of the folder in Outlook that the contacts will synchronize to.  

Each of your coworkers can also set up their own Exchange synchronization and set their own filters on which contacts to synchronize.  

After you set up synchronization, you can sync changes to the contact manually, or you can automate the process by setting up a job queue entry. For more information about automation, see the next section in this article.

### Automate synchronization

You can create a job queue entry that will synchronize contacts according to a schedule that you define. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

The following table lists the settings on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page that are for synchronizing contacts:

|Field|Setting for Contact Sync|
|-----|-----|
|Object Type to Run|Codeunit|
|Object ID to Run|6700|

## Synchronize Contacts

If you're used to working with contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you'll find it easy to sync manually from the **Contacts** list whenever it suits you. You can synchronize contacts in two ways:

* **Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all changes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Microsoft 365 that were made after the last synchronization, based on the last modified date. Also, new contacts from Microsoft 365 will be synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Typically, this action is faster than a full sync. 

* **Full Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all contacts in both directions, regardless of the last sync date and last modified date.  

In both cases, contacts are only synchronized from Outlook if they have the required fields filled in. The required fields to synchronize to Microsoft 365 are **Name**, **Email address** and the contact must be of the type **Person**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is the source of the contact information, so the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact information will be saved if there are duplicates.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a contact in Outlook, but keep it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact will be recreated in Outlook the next time you sync.

# Creating cost budgets

Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  

A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base. For more information, see [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

You use the following pages to create and analyze cost budgets. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to find a page, and then read the tooltip for each.

# Building [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data available as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] and build powerful reports about the state of your business.

This article describes how to start using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] to create reports that display [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data. After you create reports, you can publish them to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] or share them with all users in your organization. When the reports are in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], users with access can view the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)].

## Get ready

- Sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

  If you aren't signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

- Download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

  [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] is a free application you install on your local computer. Learn more at [Quickstart: Connect to data in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data).

- Make sure the data you want in the report is available as an API (recommended) or published as a web service. Learn more in [Expose data through API pages or OData web services](admin-powerbi-setup.md#exposedata).

<!--- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multi-tenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A username and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you'll need a username and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization may have a specific account for this purpose.-->

- Download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional).

  Learn more in [Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme](#theme) in this article.

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)]. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, do one of the following steps:

    - To connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
    <!--- To connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.-->

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

    If you aren't signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], you're prompted to sign in.

    - For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Sign in**, and then choose the relevant account. Use the same account that you use to sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When done, select **Connect**.

    <!--- For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, first enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then select **OK**. When prompted, enter the username and password of the account to use for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. When done, select **Connect**.-->

    > [!NOTE]  
    > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you won't be prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

6. When connected, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] contacts the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. The **Navigator** window displays the data sources that are available for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and show the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all APIs and web services that are published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], grouped by environments and companies. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, **Navigator** has the following structure:

    - **Environment name**
      - **Company name**
        - **Advanced APIs**

          This folder lists advanced APIs published by Microsoft, like the [Business Central automation APIs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/itpro-introduction-to-automation-apis) and APIs published by other organizations (these APIs are called Custom APIs). Custom APIs are further grouped in folders according to the [APIPublisher](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apipublisher-property)/[APIGroup](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apigroup-property) properties of the API source code.

        - **Standard APIs v2.0**

          This folder lists the data APIs exposed in the [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). You use these APIs to read data from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, such as master data (customer, vendor, item, and so on), transactions (general ledger entries, customer entries, and so on), or setup data (dimensions, payment methods, unit of measure, and so on).

        - **Web services \(legacy)**

          This folder lists pages, codeunits, and queries that are published as web services in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using this legacy method to read data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is discouraged. We suggest using APIs instead.

    <!--
    > [!NOTE]
    > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.-->

7. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
8. If later you want to add more Business Central data, you can repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, you can see it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, and you can begin building your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report.  

> [!TIP]
> For more information about using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], go to [Get started with Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-getting-started).

## Creating accessible reports

It's important to make your reports usable for as many people as possible. Try to design reports so that they don't require any special adaptation to meet the specific needs of different users. Make sure the design lets users take advantage of assistive technologies, like screen readers. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] includes various accessibility features, tools, and guidelines to help. To learn more, go to [Design Power BI reports for accessibility](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports) in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] documentation.

## Creating reports to display data associated with a list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can create reports that display in a FactBox on a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list page, and change when different rows are selected in the list. Creating these reports is similar to other reports, except there are a few things to do to make sure the reports display as expected. To learn more, go to [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

## <a name="theme"></a>Using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional)

Before building your report, we recommend that you download and import the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file. The theme file creates a color palette so you can build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps, without requiring you to define custom colors for each visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is optional. You can always create your reports and then download and apply the style template later.

### Download the theme

The theme file is available as a json file on Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery. To download the theme file, do the following steps:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Business-Central/m-p/385875).
2. Select the download attachment **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.json**.

### Import the theme on a report

After you download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme, you can import it to your reports. To import the theme, Select the **View** > **Themes** > **Browse for themes**. Learn more in [Power BI Desktop - Import custom report themes](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#import-custom-report-theme-files).

## Publish reports

After you create or modify a report, you can publish the report to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] and also share it with others in your organization. After you publish a report, it's available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The report also becomes available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To publish a report, select **Publish** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon or from the **File** menu. If you're signed into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], the report is published to this service. Otherwise, you're prompted to sign in. 

## Distribute or share a report

There are a couple of ways to share reports:

- Share a report from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] (recommended)

    If you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license or use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)], you can share the report directly from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI - Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

- Distribute reports as .pbix files.

    Reports are stored on your computer as .pbix files. You can distribute the .pbix file to users, like any other file. Then, the people you shared the file with can upload it to their [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upload reports from files](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Distributing reports in this way means that refreshing data for reports is done individually by each user. This situation might impact [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performance.

## How to develop cross-company or cross-environment [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API endpoints all have the prefix `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<environment_name>/api/v2.0` followed by `/companies({company_id})/accounts({id})` (here we use the `accounts` API as an illustration). You can use this structure to create PowerQuery queries that load data for multiple companies or multiple environments if the user who is reading data can access them.

To set up a query to load data for multiple companies, follow these steps:

1. Take the PowerQuery query that loads data for a single company. Convert it to a custom Power Query function that takes the company ID (or maybe the environment name) as parameters. To learn more, go to [Using custom Power Query functions](/power-query/custom-function).
1. Now use the new custom function in a PowerQuery query, where you map the function over a list of companies and then merge the datasets using the [Table.Combine](/powerquery-m/table-combine) Power Query function.

## <a name="advancedopts"></a>Advanced: Customize language, timeout, database replica, or page size for your Business Central data source

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-connector-name](includes/powerbi-connector-name.md)] supports several advanced properties for connecting to a Business Central data source that you can set in your Power Query queries. The following table describes the parameters.

|Parameter|Description|Default|Learn more at|
|-|-|-|-|
|AcceptLanguage|This parameter allows you to specify preferred languages for responses, ensuring users receive messages and translatable strings in their desired language. It sets the language in which the Business Central API session runs. It influences the language of error messages, formatted values in AL, and other values that depend on language or culture.<br><br>Setting this parameter improves user satisfaction and makes the data more accessible and relevant.|*not specified*|[Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale#load-a-report-in-power-bi).|
|ODataMaxPageSize|This parameter limits the number of entities per results page, which allows for more flexibility when connecting to large datasets or using complex queries. It sets the maximum number of records to return for each page when calling an API. For example, if your table **Customers** has 13,000 records and ODataMaxPageSize is set to 5000, Power BI makes 3 API calls to get your customers. The first call gets 5,000 records, the next one gets 5000 more, and the last call gets the remaining 3000. This option can't be higher than the maximum page size enforced by Business Central, which is 20000.<br><br>Setting this parameter ensures efficient and responsive data retrieval, leading to faster insights and decision-making. You can't exceed the maximum page size defined on the service.|5000|[ODataPreferenceHeader.MaxPageSize Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.odatapreferenceheader.maxpagesize)|
|Timeout|This parameter defines the maximum duration for a request before cancellation. It sets the timeout for each single API call to Business Central. Its value can't exceed the timeout enforced on the Business Central service, which is currentæy 10 minutes (00:10:00).<br><br>Setting this parameter helps manage system resources effectively and prevents long-running queries from impacting overall system performance. Users experience minimal delays and interruptions, ensuring a smoother workflow. |00:08:00|[OData.Feed](/powerquery-m/odata-feed)|
|UseReadOnlyReplica|This parameter determines whether requests target the primary database or a read-only replica. Offloading read operations from the primary database can significantly boost performance.<br><br> Setting this property leads to faster data retrieval and improved system stability, especially during peak usage times.|true||

### Configure the advanced parameters

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
2. Complete the step that suits your scenario:

   # [Edit existing report](#tab/existing)

   1. Select **File** > **Open**.
   1. Browse for and select the report (.pbix). 
   1. In the ribbon, select **Transform Data** to open the **Power Query Editor**.

   # [Create new report](#tab/new)

   1. In the ribbon, select **Get Data**. If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
   1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services** > **Dynamics 365 Business Central** > **Connect**.
   1. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
   1. Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do. This step opens **Power Query Editor**.

   ---

3. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
4. In **Advanced Editor**, locate the line that starts with `Source =`:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

5. In the line, replace the fourth parameter of `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions` with a comma separated list of properties and values you want to set, for example:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = true, Timeout = Duration.From("00:07:00"), ODataMaxPageSize = 10000, AcceptLanguage = "it-it"])
   ```

6. Select **Done** to close **Advanced Editor**.
7. Select **Close & Apply** to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

## Fixing problems

### "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist." error when specifying a Business Central environment

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

When you connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], or when you install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] app from Microsoft AppSource that uses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, you might be prompted to input the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you want to connect to.

If you get an error similar to "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist.", follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're using the right credentials to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These credentials might not be the same credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)
2. If your environment is an embedded ISV environment, you need to specify the embedded ISV name in parenthesis as part of the environment name. For example, if you want to connect to an environment named Production from the embedded ISV named Fabrikam, you must specify "PRODUCTION (fabrikam)" as environment name.

### "Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." error connecting to custom API page

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online

By default, reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data connect to a read-only replica of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. In rare cases, depending on the API design, you might get an error when you try to connect to and get data from the API. The error looks like this:

`Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".`

If you're using a custom API, we recommend you rework the AL code to make sure it doesn't make database modifications when it's just reading data. But in case your scenario requires it, you can [configure the connector to use a read-write connection instead](#advancedopts).

title: Create Bin Contents
description: After you have set up your bins, you can specify the items that you want to store in them, and set up rules that control how often bins are refilled.

# Create Bin Contents

After you have set up your bins, you can set up the bin contents. In other words, you can set up the items you want to store in any given bin and set the rules that govern filling the bin with a particular item. You can do this manually on the **Bin Contents** page or automatically with the **Create Bin Content Worksheet** page.

## To create bin content manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to set up bin contents,  and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the bin where you want to set up contents, and then choose the **Contents** action.  
4. For each item that you want to store in the bin, fill in a line on the **Bin Contents** page with the appropriate information. Some of the fields are filled in already with information about the bin.  
5. First fill in the **Item No.** field, and then, if you are using directed put-away and pick, fill in the other fields such as the **Unit of Measure Code**, **Max. Qty.**, and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

Select the **Fixed** field if necessary. If the bin is to be used as the default bin for the item, select the **Default Bin** field.  

If you are using directed put-away and pick, and if you have entered the correct dimensional information on the item card about each item's units of measure, the maximum quantity that you enter on the **Bin Contents** page is verified against the physical capabilities of the bin. The minimum and maximum quantities are used when calculating bin replenishment and suggested put-aways.  

If you select the **Fixed** field, you are fixing the item to the bin, meaning that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will try to put this item in the bin if there is space for it, and it will preserve the record fixing the item to the bin even when the quantity in the bin is 0. Other items can be put into the bin, even though a particular item has been fixed to the bin.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set up several bin contents at the same time on the **Bin Content Creation Worksheet** page.  

## To create bin content with a worksheet

When you have created your bins, you can create the bin content that you want for each bin in the bin content creation worksheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the worksheet header, in the **Name** field, select the worksheet of the location where you want to create bin contents.  
3. In the **Bin Code** field, select the code of the bin for which you want to define bin content.  

    If you are using directed put-away and pick in this location, the fields relating to that particular bin, such as **Bin Type**, **Warehouse Class Code**, and **Bin Ranking**, will be filled in automatically. This is information that you need to consider as you define the bin content.  
4. Select the item that you want to assign to the bin, and fill in the fields related to the bin content. If you are using directed put-away and pick, and you want to use the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** function, fill in the **Max. Qty.** and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

    To set this bin as the preferred bin for the item even if the bin quantity is **0** and all other put-away criteria equal, select the **Fixed** field.  
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each item you want to assign to a bin.  
6. Choose the **Print** action to preview and print the bin content you have entered in the worksheet. Continue to revise the bin content until you are satisfied.  
7. When you are ready, choose the **Create Bin Content** action.  

In this worksheet, you can work with a number of bin content lines for a number of bins and thereby obtain a good overview of what you are putting into various bins in a given zone, aisle, or rack.

# Set up item tracking with serial, lot, and package numbers

Keep track of inventory items, even in complex warehouse configurations, by assigning numbers that are specific to each item. You can use numbers for individual objects, lots, or packages. With item tracking, you can trace items across internal warehouse movements, and outbound and inbound documents.

Items with serial and lot numbers can be traced both backwards and forward in the supply chain. Tracing is useful for general quality assurance and for product recalls. For more information, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md).  

## Numbers and item tracking

As part of your warehouse processes, you can bundle your stock in packages, boxes, containers, and so on. But in order to keep track of the items, you assign unique numbers as identification. For example, you manufacture and sell a chair that has the item number *1900-S*. Each chair has a serial number, *1001*, but you also bundle four chairs into a lot, *LOT0001*. You also ship the chairs in a container with the package number *CONTAINER010* that also includes *LOT0100* with side tables, and *LOT200* with lamps.  

Depending on your configuration, you use these different numbers to keep track of inventory in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the various stages of purchasing, sales, warehouse operations, and so on.

## To set up item tracking codes

An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, and the **Package Tracking** FastTabs, define policies of item tracking by serial, lot, and package numbers respectively.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to track specific items or specific lots throughout their lifetime, you must choose the **SN Specific Tracking**, **Lot Specific Tracking**, and **Package Specific Tracking** fields, respectively. As a result, when you handle an outbound unit of an item with this item tracking code, you must always specify which serial number or lot number to handle. This means that when you sell a unit of the item, it must be applied against a specific pool of serial numbers or lot numbers. In other words, the serial, lot, or package number assigned to the item when it enters inventory must follow the item when it leaves inventory.

Because these setup fields cover all possible transactions with the item, the individual inbound/outbound fields are selected. However, the individual inbound/outbound fields have nothing to do with application across inventory. They merely define your company's work flow concerning when to assign item tracking numbers.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To assign item tracking numbers in warehouse activities, the **SN Warehouse Tracking** and **Lot Warehouse Tracking** fields must be selected on the item's item tracking code card.  

## To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, select the following fields:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Strict Expiration Posting**|Specifies that the expiration date for the item tracking number when it entered inventory is respected when it exits inventory.|  
    |**Require Expiration Date Entry**|Specifies that you must enter an expiration date on the item tracking line.|  
    |**Use Expiration Dates**|Specifies that you want to calculate expiration dates. |  

## To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory expire.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, fill in the **Warranty Date Formula** field, and then select the fields as follows:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Warranty Date Formula**|Specifies the last day of warranty for the item.|  
    |**Require Warranty Date Entry**|Specifies that you must manually enter a warranty date on the item tracking line.|  

## To set up items for tracking with the correct item tracking codes

To enable item tracking, you first have to assign the item tracking codes to an item. There are two ways to add item tracking codes, by selecting the code from a predefined list or by assigning a new unique code. Hover over the fields to read a short description.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item from the list, and open the **Item Card** page.  
3. On the **Item Tracking** FastTab, assign the appropriate item tracking codes and choose the **Item Tracking Code**, the **Serial Nos.**, and the **Lot Nos.**.
    1. Alternatively you can also create a new item tracking code by selecting the **New** action.

## To specify opening balances for the items, you track

You can create opening balances for the items you track. Because you can choose different warehouse configurations, there are two options:

* Enable specific batches on the **Item Journal** page to let people enter serial, lot, and package data directly on journal lines.
* For locations where the **Directed Put-away and Pick** toggle is turned on, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page to make all item tracking fields available. The fields that are available include the **Warranty Date** and **Expiration Date** fields.

### Item journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To open a list of item journal batches, choose the **Name** field.
3. Choose **New** to create a new batch, and then turn on the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.
4. Choose **OK** to select the batch you created.
5. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
    1. Alternatively choose the **Edit in Excel** action. Using Excel lets you quickly fill in columns, including **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, **Package No.**, **Expiration Date**, and **Warranty Date**. When you're done, choose **Publish** to send changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose the **Post** action to adjust inventory.

> [!NOTE] 
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does a few minor validations when you enter or import data. A more comprehensive check happens when you post or transfer data from journal lines to the **Item Tracking** page. The latter happens automatically when you open the **Item Tracking** page from the item journal line or if you choose the **Update Item Tracking Lines** action.

### Warehouse physical inventory journal for locations where directed pick and put-away is turned on  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
3. Choose the **Register** action to make the inventory adjustments. Remember to synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries. To learn more, go to [synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

For bulk imports, use configuration packages to import data to the journals.

# Manage project supplies

You should manage project supplies of items, services, and expenses as an integral part of all projects. You can use inventory quantities or make project-specific purchases through purchase orders or purchase invoices. For example, when service on a computer requires a new disk, you create a purchase invoice to buy a new disk and record the project that uses it.

If the purchase process doesn't require you to record the physical transaction separately, you can process a purchase on the **Project G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [To post a project-related expense](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md#to-post-a-project-related-expense).

## Manual or semi-automated replenishment

If you already know which supplies you need to replenish for a project, you can create a purchase order. To learn more, go to [Manual or semi-automated replenishment](#manual-or-semi-automated-replenishment).

However, if you aren't sure what you're missing, you can use a semi-automated process where you create a purchase order directly from a project. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps by listing all items and shows whether they're available or unavailable. You can adjust the quantities to replenish on the lines.  

The semi-automated process creates a purchase order for each vendor from which you purchase the items, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page. You can continue to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines.

Later, you can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action. To learn more, go to [Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project](#use-a-semi-automated-replenishment-process-for-a-project).

> [!NOTE]
> As in other cases that involve advanced inventory processes, such as reservation, warehousing, and assemble-to-order, the project's status must be **Open** and the **Apply Usage Link** toggle must be turned on.

### Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a project that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.
4. The **Create Purchase Orders** page shows a line for each item on the project. Lines for both fully available quantities and unavailable quantities show by default. To show only unavailable quantities, choose the **Show Unavailable** action.
5. The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable quantity. To purchase a different quantity, edit the value in the field.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on unavailable lines, even though they represent fully available quantities.

6. You can also turn on the **Reserve** toggle if you want to reserve the quantity on the purchase line against a demand instead of filling out the **Project No.** and **Project Task NO.** fields on the purchase line. By default, the **Reserve** toggle is hidden on the page. You can personalize the page to add the toggle. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
7. Select **OK**.

You can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action.

### Replenish a project manually

The following procedure shows how to use a purchase invoice to purchase products for a project. The same steps apply when using a purchase order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action and fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. In the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields, select the information of the project that you want to purchase items or services for. Use the personalization tools if a field isn't visible. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    The value that you select in the **Project Line Type** field defines whether a planning line is created when you post the usage of the item. If the field contains **Billable**, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. To learn more, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md).

### How posting purchases affects inventory and WIP

When you post a receipt, the inventory is received and immediately written-off by an item ledger entry of the type **Negative Adjustment**. To avoid affecting WIP calculation, the project ledger entries don't include purchase order lines that aren't of the type **G/L Account**.

Project ledger entries are created as follows:

* From a purchase order, when you choose the **Post** action and choose **Invoice**.
* From a purchase invoice, when you choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action on the **Lines** FastTab, and then the **Post** action.

### To view the value of purchases for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.

    On the **Tasks** FastTab, the **Outstanding Orders** field shows the total outstanding amount, in local currency, of inventory items and services on purchase documents for the project task line.  

    The **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced** field shows the value of items delivered on purchase documents but not invoiced.  
3. Choose either of the fields to open the **Purchase Lines** page where you can review information about the related purchase document lines, including which items or services are received.

## To post a project-related expense

If you incur extraordinary or one-time project expenses, you can use the **Project G/L Journal** page to post them directly to the relevant project account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line and enter information about the expense, including information in the **Project No.** and **Project Task No** fields.  
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

## Receive items for projects with warehouse receipts or put-aways

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers advanced warehouse handling for purchase orders that are linked to projects. Save some time by using warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways to directly receive and register usage of items for projects.

Use the following methods to receive items:

- Post receipt and consumption from the order line.
- Post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document.
- Post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document.

### To post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document

When your location is set up to require processing put-aways but not receipts, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your purchase orders.

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:

- Create the inventory put-away directly from the purchase order by choosing the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
- Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement** batch job.
- Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the purchase orders to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document on the **Inventory Put-away** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If bins are mandatory for the location, make sure that the **Bin Code** is filled in the purchase order lines.

### To post the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.
1. Enter the quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.
1. After you put away the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines that were put away. There are two item ledger entries for each line. One entry for receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project. There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice. If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

### To post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document

You must get the lines from the released purchase order that the receipt is for. You can create warehouse receipts in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action on the **Purchase Order** page to create warehouse receipt for a source document.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action on the **Purchase Order** page to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a warehouse receipt for one or more released source documents.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use bins, the default bin is suggested. You can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in.

### To post the warehouse receipt

1. On the **Warehouse Receipts** page, open the warehouse receipt.
1. The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed.
1. After you received the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines. There are two item ledger entries for each receipt line. One entry for the receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project.

There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice.

If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Warehouse put-away documents aren't created, even if your warehouse processes require both receipt and warehouse put-away.

### Good to know

- Return orders aren't supported for locations with directed put-away and pick. You need to undo consumption via a project journal, and then create return order for items in inventory.
- If purchase documents were created before the update, you can post them directly. If you want to use warehouse handling, reopen and release the purchase orders again.
- You can't edit the **No.**, **Variant Code**, **Project No.**, and **Project Task No.** fields on purchase lines if warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways exist.

# Searching for Customers, Vendors, and Other Contacts from Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]. Introduced in 2021 release wave 1.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a comprehensive business contact management system that is essential for users in sales, operations, or other departmental roles. If you're a user in one of these roles, you'll often need to look up, meet, or start a conversation with your vendors, customers, and other contacts. With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can do these tasks directly from Teams, without having to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From within Teams, you can:

- Look up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts from the Teams command box or from the message compose area. Contacts can include prospects, vendors, customers, or other business relationships.
- Share a contact as a card in a Teams conversation.
- View details about the contact, interaction history, and other insights like outstanding payments or open documents.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)
- You've got a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account with access to contacts in at least one company.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you searching from the command box or message compose box, you may be asked to sign in or set up the app the first time. This step is necessary to search for contacts in the right Business Central company. Learn more about setting up the app to choose your company in [Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams](across-teams-settings.md).

## Look up contacts from the command box

The command box is at the top of every screen in Teams. It lets you search, take quick actions, or launch apps, like the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. Searching from the command box is great for quickly looking up contacts and their related data for your own use. For example, suppose you want to look up an email address of a vendor to set up a calendar meeting. Or maybe you want to look up interaction history during a meeting with a customer.

1. In the command box, type **/Business Central**, then select the Business Central app from the results.

    ![Open Business Central app  to search for contacts from command box.](media/teams-contacts-command-1b.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search Business Central contacts from command box in Teams.](media/teams-contacts-command-3.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears beneath the command box.

4. If you want to add the contact card into a conversation, go to the upper right corner of the card, select **... (More options)** > **Copy**. Then, paste the copy in the message compose box of a conversation.  

Learn more about the Teams command box at [Teams - Use the command box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-command-box-13c4e429-7324-4886-b377-5dbed539193b).

## Look up contacts from the message compose box

The advantage of using the message compose box is that you can add a contact card directly to a conversation, for others to see.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+** and then select **Business Central** from the list to launch the app.

    ![Open Business Central app to search for contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-message-box-2.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search for Business Central contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-6.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears in the message compose box.

> [!NOTE]
> The contact card isn't sent to the conversation right away for others to see. You have the opportunity to review the contents of the card, and add text before or after it as you like. Then, send your message to the chat when ready.

## Viewing contact card details

The contact card in Teams gives you a quick overview of the customer, vendor, or contact. The card is interactive&mdash;meaning you can view more information or even modify a contact by using the **Details** or **Pop-out** buttons.

The **Details** button opens a window within Teams that displays more information about the contact, but not as much as you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To see all the information about a contact in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Pop-out**.

The contact card works just like cards for records, like items, customers, or sales orders. Learn more in [View card details](across-working-with-teams.md#view-card-details).

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central contact that you submit to a conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

# Import payroll transactions

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger. To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping.

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this functionality, an extension for payroll import must be installed and enabled. The Ceridian Payroll and the Quickbooks Payroll File Import extensions are pre-installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## To import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action. An assisted setup guide opens.
3. Follow the steps on the **Import Payroll Transactions** page.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   In the step about mapping the external payroll records to your G/L accounts, the mappings that you make will be remembered next time the same records are imported. This will save you time as you do not have to manually fill in the **Account No.** field in the general journal every time you have imported recurring payroll transactions.   

    When you choose the **OK** button in the assisted setup guide, the **General Journal** page is filled with lines representing the transactions that the payroll file contains and with the relevant accounts prefilled in the **G/L Account** fields according to mappings you made in the guide.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).

title: Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time
description: Learn how to select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate or scheduled batch posting in Business Central.

# Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time

Instead of posting individual documents one by one, you can select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate posting or for batch posting according to a schedule, such as at the end of the day. This may be useful if only a supervisor can post documents created by other users or to avoid system performance issues from posting during work hours.

## To post multiple purchase orders immediately

The following procedure explains how to post multiple purchase orders immediately. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post** action.
6. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

## To batch post multiple purchase orders

The following procedure explains how to batch post purchase orders. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents where the **Batch Post** action is available.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post Batch** action.
6. On the **Batch Post Purchase Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **OK** button.
8. To view potential issues that occurred during batch posting of documents, open the **Error Message Register** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Posting of multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To set up background posting with job queues
Job queues are an effective tool to schedule the running of business processes in the background, such as when multiple users are trying to post sales orders, but only one order can be processed at a time.  

The following procedure explains how to set up background posting of sales orders. The steps are similar for purchasing.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the **Post with Job Queue** check box.
3. Choose the **Job Queue Category Code** field, and then specify the **SALESPOST** code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some jobs change the same data and should not run at the same time because that can cause conflicts. For example, background jobs for sales documents will try to modify the same data at the same time. Job queue categories help prevent these kinds of conflicts by ensuring that when one job is running, another job that belongs to the same job queue category will not run until it finishes. For example, a job that belongs to a Sales job queue category will wait until all other sales related jobs are done. You specify a job queue category on the **Background Posting** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
    >
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides job queue categories for sales, purchase, and general ledger posting. We recommend that one of these, or one that you create, is always specified. If you experience failures due to conflicts, consider setting up a category for all sales, purchase, and general ledger background posting.

    If you also want sales documents to be printed when they are posted, select the **Post & Print with Job Queue** check box on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  
    If you select **PDF** in the **Report Output Type** field, successfully posted purchase orders will be available in the **Report Inbox** part on your Role Center.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you set up a job that will post and print documents, and the printer displays a dialog box, such as a request for credentials or a warning about low printer ink, your document is posted but not printed. The corresponding job queue entry eventually times out and the **Status** field is set to **Error**. Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use a printer setup that requires interaction with the display of printer dialog boxes in conjunction with background posting.

    Next time that you post sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a job queue entry for each document and run the jobs in the background, one by one.

4. To verify that the job queue is working as expected, post a sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
    The sales order will now be added to a dedicated job queue entry, which defines when the documents are posted. 

### To view status from a sales or purchase document
If the job queue cannot post the sales order, the status is changed to **Error** and the sales order is added to the list of sales orders that the user must handle manually.
1. From the document that you have tried to post with background posting, choose the **Job Queue Status** field, which will contain **Error**.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

Alternatively, you can review on the **Job Queue Log Entries** page if the sales order was posted successfully. For more information, see the [Monitor the job queue](#monitor-the-job-queue) section.

## To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders

Alternatively, you can postpone postings for when it is convenient for your organization. For example, in your business it might make sense to run certain routines when most of the data entry for the day has concluded. You can achieve this by setting the job queue up to run various batch-posting reports, such as the **Batch Post Sales Orders**, **Batch Post Sales Invoices**, and similar reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports background posting for all sales, purchasing, and service documents.

The following procedure shows how to set the **Batch Post Sales Orders** report up to automatically post sales orders at 4 PM on weekdays.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select 296, **Batch Post Sales Orders**.

   You can also use following reports:
  
   * 900 **Batch Post Assembly Orders**
   * 497 **Batch Post Purchase Invoices**
   * 496 **Batch Post Purchase Orders**
   * 498 **Batch Post Purch. Credit Memos**
   * 6665 **Batch Post Purch. Ret. Orders**
   * 298 **Batch Post Sales Credit Memos**
   * 297 **Batch Post Sales Invoices**
   * 296 **Batch Post Sales Orders**
   * 6655 **Batch Post Sales Return Orders**
   * 6005 **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos**
   * 6004 **Batch Post Service Invoices**
   * 6001 **Batch Post Service Orders**

5. Select the **Report Request Page** check box.
6. In the **Batch Post Sales Orders** request page, define what is included during automatic posting of sales orders, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to set strict filters; otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they are not ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value *Released*, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value *..today*. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
7. Select all check boxes from **Run on Mondays** through **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter 4 PM.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Sales orders that are within defined filters will now be posted every weekday at 4 PM.

## Monitor the job queue

If you set up background posting with job queues, make it a regular task to monitor the job queue to catch any issues. You can track the status in the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

As an administrator, you can use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that you can use to identify problems. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) in the developer and administration content.

# Set Up Finance Charge Terms

When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos. But first, you must set up a code that represents each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the Fin. Charge Terms Code field on customer cards.  

## Finance charge terms

You must set up finance charge terms for each finance charge calculation, and then assign the terms to the customer in the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** field on the **Customer** page.

Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance or the balance due methods.

* Average daily balance  
  
  The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:  
  *Average Daily Balance method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Days Overdue / Interest Period)* x *(Interest Rate/100)*

* Balance due  
  
  The finance charge is a percentage of the overdue amount:  
  *Balance Due method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Interest Rate / 100)*

Additionally, each term in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to include on the finance charge memo.

### To set up finance charge terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To use more than one combination of finance charge terms, set up a code for each one.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify individual conditions that can include additional fees in both LCY and in foreign currency. You can define additional fees in foreign currencies for each term on the **Finance Charge Terms** page.
4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Fin. Chrg. Terms** page, define for each term a currency code and an additional fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create finance charges in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create finance charge memos. If there are no foreign currency finance charge conditions set up, the LCY finance charge conditions specified on the **Finance Charge Terms** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the finance charge memo.  
6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill on the **Finance Charge Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the resulting finance charge text, enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.

|Placeholder|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
|%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%7|The total amount of the reminder|

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# The Service Declaration Extension

In some EU countries/regions, authorities require that businesses report the export of services to other EU countries/regions. The **Service Declaration** extension lets you collect information about service trade in the EU and report it to the authorities. Although its name is **Service Declaration**, you can also use it as **Intrastat for Services**. This extension is available for all EU countries/regions as a W1 version, and it can be used as-is in Belgium. For other countries/regions, an extension based on the country/region is required. If a country/region only needs a different format, you can use the report configuration in the **Data Exchange Framework** to change the format.

## Enable the Service Declaration extension

After you install the extension in your environment, you need to enable it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set up an IRS 1096 feature**, and then choose the related link.
2. Follow steps in the assisted setup guide. The most of fields are configured by default.
3. Add only **Service Transaction Types** in the second step by choosing the **Open the service transaction types page to specify the list of codes** option.
4. Before you start, check the **Total number of codes** to understand how many service transaction types are already specified.
5. Choose **Finish** in the last step to finish the configuration.

## Set up the Service Declaration extension

You can set up the extension manually, or by using a reporting file on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page.

### To set up Service Declaration manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.

Only documents where these two codes are different are included in the service declaration.<br><br>* **Bill-To.**: Use the country code from the **Bill-to Customer** <br<br>* **Sell-To.**: Use the country code from the **Sell-to Customer**.        |
    |**Buy-From/Pay-To Vendor No.**  | Specifies which vendor to use to compare their country code with the country code from the **Company Information** page. Only documents where these two codes are different are included in the service declaration.<br><br> * **Buy-From.**: Use the country code from the **Buy-From Vendor**. <br><br> * **Pay-To.**: Use the country code from the **Pay-To Vendor**.         |
    |**Data Exch. Def. Code**  | Specifies the data exchange definition code used to generate the exported file for the service declaration.        |
    |**Enable Tax Registration No.**     |  Specifies whether the **Tax Registration No.** is enabled for the service declaration.       |

3. In the **Service Transaction Type Code** field, specify the code for a **Service transaction type**.
4. If you don’t want to include this item charge in service declarations, select the **Exclude From Service Declaration** field.

## Create new service declaration

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declarations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Config. Code** field, specify the configuration code that is used to suggest lines and create files. You need to choose one as a **Service Declaration**.
    2. In the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, specify the start and end dates of the period to include in the service declaration.
4. Choose the **Suggest lines** action to start a batch job that collects lines from documents and fills in the service declaration lines.

The batch job retrieves all entries from applicable purchase and sales documents in the required period and adds them on the service declaration lines. Hover over fields in lines to read a short description.

## Modify a service declaration

If needed, you can modify the lines or add new ones.

1. On the **Service Declaration** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. In the **Document Type** field, choose the option related to the document you want to use.
3. Based on the **Document Type**, fill in the **Document No.** field.
4. Fill in the remaining fields.

## Overview the service declaration lines

After you create a service declaration, use the **Overview** action to get an overview of the service declaration lines. You can group and summarize the lines in the same way as the exported file. You can also open the lines in Excel.

## Report Service Declaration in a file

You can submit the service declaration as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declarations**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service declaration you want to report as a file.
3. Fill in the service declaration manually, or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The service declaration file is saved in the required format.

## Other considerations

When you're using the **Service Declaration** extension, there are a few more things to consider. For example, it's important that your groups match requirements from authorities. It's also important that services are included correctly on sales and purchase documents.

### Grouping lines

On service declaration lines, there's no grouping by any field. All entries are copied from the original document as a source.

Grouping required by authorities is provided in the exported file. You must configure the groups in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Using services in document lines

When you create a purchase, sales, or service  invoice, there are two fields related to service declarations on their lines. Both fields are filled in with the default values from your item, resource, or item charge set ups.

- **Service Transaction Type Code** - Specifies the code for a service transaction type.
- **Applicable For Service Declaration** - Specifies whether an item or resource is applicable for a service declaration.

You can change the values in these fields, but if you select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you must specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field. If you don't, you can't post the document.

If you specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field but don’t select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you can post the document, but the line isn't calculated.

# Analyze cash flow in your company
The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insights that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

| To answer questions like these | Use this chart |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? |Cash Cycle |
| When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? |Cash Flow |
| Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? |Income & Expense |
| When might a cash surplus or deficit happens?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? |Cash Flow Forecasts |

On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  

* See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
* View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what is displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.  

## To view a cash flow worksheet

1. Search for **Cash Flow Forecasts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.

# Track packages
Most shipping agents provide a web service that lets you track the status of your packages while they're en route. That information can be useful in many business processes, for example, when providing customer service. If you use one or more shipping agents, you can enter some basic information about them, and then use their package tracking service directly from the Posted Sales Shipments, Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages. For more information, see [Set Up Shipping Agents](sales-how-to-set-up-shipping-agents.md). 

The following procedure shows how to track a package from a posted sales shipment, but the same steps apply to enable package tracking from the Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, and Posted Return Receipt pages.  

## To track a package

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure uses the Posted Sales Shipment page as an example. The steps to track a package are the same on the Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the shipment you want to track, and then choose the **Update Document** action.
3. In the **Package Tracking No.** field, enter the package number you received from the shipping agent. 
4. Make sure that the correct shipping agent and the level of service are correct, and then close the page.
5. Choose the **Track Package** action to open the shipping agent's package tracking service.

# Set Up Salespeople

Many companies want to follow an individual employee's performance as a basis for calculating the sales commission or bonus. See, for example, the **Salesperson Commissions** report. A company may also want to assign a salesperson to each of their contacts.

When you have set up a salesperson on the **Salespeople** page, you can select it in the **Salesperson Code** field on all relevant records, such as G/L account, customer, vendor, contacts, and campaign cards. Then, when you post or set up invoices, credit memos, journal lines, finance charge activities, and so on, the salesperson code is carried to the resulting ledger entries.
<br><br>

## To set up a salesperson code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Salespeople** page, choose the **New** action.

You can use salespeople in various relationship management and marketing work. For example, you can assign tasks to salespeople, so that the tasks are incorporated in sales opportunities that the salesperson are assigned to.

# Period-Over-Period (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period** report provides valuable insights into your purchasing performance over time. This report compares purchasing amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, so you can identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the purchasing amount in October 2023 to the purchasing amount in October 2022. If the scope is fiscal years, the report compares the purchasing amount in fiscal year 2023 to the purchasing amount in 2022.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-period-over-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Period-Over-Period Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-period-over-period.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs can get insights into your organization's purchase spending over time. By comparing purchase amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify purchasing trends and growth.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the growth amount and growth percentage, and evaluate spending over the current fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust purchasing plans and allocate budgets effectively.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Period-Over-Period* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)  
- [**Previous Period**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-pp-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-pop-fiscal)  
- [**Period-over-Period Growth %**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-pop--fiscal)

# Set up time sheets

Time sheets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handle time registration in weekly increments of seven days. You can use them to track the time used on projects, and you can use them to record simple resource time registration. Before you use time sheets, you must specify which users will submit time sheets and how you want to configure time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> The people who use time sheets are *resources*. For example, that lets you use time sheets to track the work of non-employees. To track the work of employees, or to use time sheets to track employee absence, you must associate employees with resources. There's an assisted setup guide that can help you do that. To learn about the guide, go to [Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide](#set-up-time-sheets-with-the-assisted-setup-guide).  

Optionally, specify whether and how time sheets are approved. Depending on the needs of your organization, you can designate:

* One or more users as the time sheet administrator and approver for all time sheets.
* A time sheet approver for each resource.

When you have set up time sheets, you can create time sheets for resources, and the resources can post time sheet lines. Optionally, assign time sheets to project planning lines. To learn more, go to [Use Time Sheets](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md).  

## Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide

An assisted setup guide can help you set up time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> If you're a version earlier than 2023 release wave 1 (v22), you must enable the **Feature Update: New time sheet experience** feature in the [Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610) page to use this capability.
>
> This setting also lets you use time sheets on mobile devices.

Open the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide from the [Assisted Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801) page.

The assisted setup guide takes you through the following steps:

1. Set up the participants in the time sheet processes.

    The first page in the guide shows you the number of users in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It also shows other required and optional information.  
2. Specify the first day of a work week in this organization.

    The first day of a work week is the default first day for all time sheets.
3. Specify the person who administers time sheets.

    This person can edit and delete all time sheets. Optionally, add the same role to other people in the **User Setup** page.
4. Set up the resources who will use time sheets, and the people who will approve time sheets.

At the end of the setup guide, you can choose to let [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] create time sheets based on your configuration. View the new time sheets in the **Time Sheets** page, which you can open [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=951). Alternatively, run the assisted setup guide again, or complete the setup manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, you must manually turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option for the time sheet setup, as described in the next procedure.

## Set up time sheets manually

The following sections describe how to set up time sheets if you don't use the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide.  

### Set up general information for time sheets manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option.
1. For the **Time Sheet by Job Approval** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Never** |The user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |
| **Always** |The user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. |
| **Machine Only** |If the machine time sheet is linked with a job, then the user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. If the machine time sheet is linked with a resource, then the user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |

### Assign a time sheet administrator manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the user who will be the time sheet administrator, and then select the **Time Sheet Admin.** checkbox.  

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you designate only one user as the time sheet administrator for a company. In the following procedure, you set up a time sheet owner and approver where the time sheet approver is assigned for each resource.  

### Assign a time sheets owner and approver manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for which you want to set up the ability to use time sheets, and then select the **Use Time Sheet** checkbox.  
3. In the **Time Sheet Owner User ID** field, enter the ID of the owner of the time sheet. The owner can enter time usage on a time sheet and submit it for approval. Typically, when the resource is a person, that person is also the owner.  
4. In the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field, enter the ID of the approver of the time sheet. The approver can approve, reject, or reopen a time sheet.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't change the ID of the time sheet approver if there are time sheets that haven't been processed and have the status of **Submitted** or **Open**.

# Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages

Before you start using sales opportunities, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. A sales cycle is made up of a series of stages that go from the initial contact to the closing of a sale. For each stage, you define any requirements that must be met, such as requiring a sales quote, before an opportunity can go to the next stage. You can also specify whether a stage can be skipped. You can set up as many sales cycles as you need. You can set up as many sales cycle stages as necessary within a sales cycle.

To use opportunity sales cycles, you must set up the sales cycle, define the different stages of the cycle, and then assign the cycle to opportunities. Assigning the relevant activity or tasks to the opportunity may also be part of setting up a sales cycle.

This article also describes how to set up tasks and activities, and how to assign tasks to activities. For more information, see [To set up activities with tasks](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md#to-set-up-activities-with-tasks).

## To set up opportunity sales cycle codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Cycles**, and then choose the related link. The **Sales Cycles** page opens, and lists all the existing sales cycles.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Repeat these steps to set up as many sales cycles as you want. After you have set up opportunity sales cycles, you may want to set up the different stages within each cycle.

## To define opportunity sales cycle stages

1. On the **Sales Cycles** page, select the opportunity sales cycle for which you want to set up stages, and then choose the **Stages** action. The **Sales Cycle Stages** page opens.
2. Choose the **New** action to enter a new stage in the sales cycle.

Repeat these steps to set up as many stages as you want within the sales cycle.

## To assign stage cycles to opportunities

After you add the opportunities stage cycle, you can start to add sales opportunities, and then assign the stage cycle to opportunities by setting the **Sales Cycle Code** field. For more information, see [Create Sales Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md).

## To set up activities with tasks

You can combine multiple tasks, such as tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. You can assign activities to opportunities, salespeople, or contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Activities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define one or more tasks in the activity.

## To assign tasks or activities of tasks to opportunities

When you have set up a task, you can assign it to a sales opportunity and thereby assign the activity that the task belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create tasks of type *Meeting* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. The capability requires access to an on-premises deployment.

The following procedure describes how to assign activity tasks to opportunities. The steps are similar when you assign tasks to salespeople and contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an opportunity, and then choose the **Tasks** action.
3. On the **Task List** page, choose the **Create Task** action.
4. The **Create Task** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > As you can see in the **Opportunity** field, the task is automatically assigned to the relevant opportunity.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. On the **Task List** page, select the new task, and then choose the **Assign Activities** action.
7. On the **Assign Activity** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Payment practices report  

Authorities in some country/regions require large companies to report their payment practices and performance regarding how quickly they pay their vendors. For example, each year Swedish companies with 250 or more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office the payment times they have for purchases from smaller companies. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The legislation is intended to protect smaller businesses from bearing financial burdens that late payments cause.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries currently require this type of reporting. Because the requirements are largely the same, this is a global feature that all countries/regions can use.  

You can base the report on different sources, and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms. Companies can provide reports for vendors for the following information, as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.
- The percentage of invoices they paid within the agreed payment period.

You can select the period for which to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries.

## Generate the report

To run the **Payment Practices** report, use the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that op the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Practices**, and then select the related link. 
2. Select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter values in the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|-----------------------------------|
   | No. | Specify the number of the entry or record for the report. |
   | Aggregation Type | Specify how data is aggregated. If you choose **Period**, the report is covers the period defined in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. If you choose **Company Size**, the report is based on the number of employees in the vendor company. **Note:** To use the **Company Size** option, you must first create sizes in the **Company Sizes** page and assign them to the relevant vendors in the **Company Size Code** field on the **Vendor Card** page.  |
   | Header Type | Specifies the source for entries in the payment practice, and you can choose Vendors, Customers or both. |
   | Starting Date | Specifies the starting date of the payment practice. |
   | Ending Date | Specifies the ending date of the payment practice. |

4. After you fill in the fields in the header, use the **Generate** action to generate the report data.

When you generate the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Generated On** and **Generated By** fields with the date and time it was generated and by whom, respectively.

## Edit the results

Based on the selection in the **Aggregation Type** field, you get different lines. You can change the values on the lines. If you do, the report is marked as **Modified Manually**.

## Review the calculations

To explore the calculations behind the values on the **Statistics** FastTab, choose the value in the field to open the **Payment Practice Data List** page.

## Print the report

To print the document, choose the **Print** action.

# Sales by Item (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Item** report gives a clear picture of your organization's item sales. It showcases key metrics for each item or item category. For example, the sales amount, quantities, and the cost amounts. You can break down the information further by the specific customers that buy the items.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Item Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify which items aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Category
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in advanced warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depend on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In an advanced warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, use the following settings:

- Production, in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Assembly, in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Project management, in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

When the location is set up to require warehouse pick processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the usage or consumption of components.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where a person who is processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** page. Select the lines to pick and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you release **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** to warehouse making the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

To pick or move components for source documents in a pull fashion, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|Change the order status to Released or create a released production order right away.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status to Released.|
|Projects | Change status to Open or create project with status Open right away.|  

## Production

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins to move items to open shop floor bins, you can use the following methods:

- For a location that uses directed put-away and pick, follow the steps in the [Move Items in advanced warehouse configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md) article.
- For other locations, follow the steps in the [Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md) article.

### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

## Assembly  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).

## Project management  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields in a purchase order together with locations where the **Directed Put-Away and Pick** toggle is turned on. You must post receipts and consumption separately with the fully directed warehouse flow.

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list shows the released production, projects, and assembly orders that have been forwarded to the pick function. The orders include those for which pick instructions are already created. Documents with pick lines that have been picked and registered aren't shown on this list.  
3. Select the orders for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a document that already has instructions for all its lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] informs you that there is nothing to handle. To combine the already created warehouse pick instructions into one pick instruction, delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines the way you prefer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting tools are available, along with bin ranking. You can easily recreate the order of the lines you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or by sorting in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-dock bins, which is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.

6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can also delete some of the lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items are picked with the other items on the source document, and the cross-dock bins have space for more incoming items.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The lines are only deleted from this worksheet, not from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick.  

    Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Creates separate pick documents for each customer (project)|
    |Per Item|Creates separate pick documents for each item in the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Creates separate pick documents for each zone that you take the items from.|
    |Per Bin|Creates separate pick documents for each bin that you take the items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Creates separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Use the following options to specify how to create the pick documents.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that cover up to the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and picked.|
    |Don't Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the **Qty. to Handle** field empty on the created pick lines.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they're created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To pick items for a production order, assembly order, or project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    Operation areas such as production shop floors might have a default bin for the components they require. If so, the default bin code is added to the warehouse pick document to indicate where to put the items. For more information, see the tooltips for the **To-Production Bin Code**, the **To-Assembly Bin Code**, the **To-Project Bin Code** fields.

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, the bin rankings are used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    - The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    - The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

      You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    - If the take and place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    - If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the production, assembly or project area or bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    You can now bring the items to the respective area and post the usage or consumption of the picked components by posting consumption journal, assembly order, or project journal. The following articles provide more information:

    - [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
    - [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
    - [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Flushing production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the selected flushing method, you can pick components for production om the following ways:

* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward** flushing method. Consumption of the components happens automatically either when you change the status of the production order or by starting or ending an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stop for that component.
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Forward** or **Backward** flushing method. Components are automatically consumed either when you change of status of the production order or start or end an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stops for that component. Learn more at [Move Items](warehouse-move-items.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the Manual flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal. Other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps describe the actions that different people take and the related response:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Warehouse Pick** action on the production order. A warehouse pick document is created pick for items with **Manual**, **Pick + Backward**, and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods. These items are placed in the To-Production bin.  
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks to a warehouse employee.  
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the warehouse pick. The bin might be a work center or machine center bin.
5. The warehouse employee registers the pick. The quantity is transferred from the pick bin to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the quantity picked can be consumed.  
6. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.
7. The shop floor supervisor uses the consumption journal or production journal to post the consumption of component items that use either **Manual** flushing method.
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.  

:::image type="content" source="media/binflow.png" alt-text="Overview of when and how the Bin Code field is filled in.":::

## Make-to-Order (MTO) production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

In scenarios where a produced item consists of raw materials and semi-finished items with the manufacturing policy set to **Make-to-order**, the warehouse pick for those semi-finished components is added to the same production order with the **Planning Level Code** field filled in. It's expected that the semi-finished items are available for consumption immediately and won't require pick so they aren't included in the warehouse pick document. The created warehouse picks only include raw materials for produced item and for semi-finished items.

However, if semi-finished items are available on stock, the planning system suggests that you consume those instead of producing the whole quantity. For example, a produced item requires five semi-finished components, but three are already in stock. In this case, five semi-finished items are listed in the production order components, but only two are produced in the same production order as a separate production order line.
Such a setup isn't compatible with warehouse picks and, depending on frequency, you must either change the manufacturing policy for such semi-finished items to **Make-to-stock** or manually split the production order component line when you need to pick the semi-finished items produced earlier.

# Work with carbon credits  

When you can't reduce your emissions for some reason, you can purchase carbon credits to offset them. By buying carbon credits, you can still emit the equivalent amount of gases but remain carbon neutral. You can purchase carbon credits from specialized providers.  

In general, carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or other greenhouse gases (GHGs). One carbon credit typically represents the right to emit one metric ton of CO₂ or an equivalent amount of another GHG, so it's important for some organizations to enable this option.  

## Set up carbon credits

You set up carbon credits in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as items. A credit can be an inventory, service, or non-inventory type of item.

To set up an item as a carbon credit, follow these steps:
  
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new item. To learn more about how to create an item, go to [Register new items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, turn on the **GHG Credit** toggle.
4. In the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field, enter the value of the carbon credit.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field represents the amount of CO₂ in the unit of measure configured in the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page. The total value of carbon credit is the amount of credited CO₂ per one **Base Unit of Measure** of the item.

## Purchase carbon credits

### Purchase documents

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow the steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   1. Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   2. Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab. To learn more, go to [How to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the item configured as a carbon credit in the **No.** field on a line. Then fill in the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields.
4. In the **Sustainability Account No.** field, choose the account to use for decreasing your carbon dioxide (CO₂) value. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Emission CO2** field based on the value you configured in the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field on the **Item** card.
5. Post the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Although carbon credits decrease the value of entries, the **Emission CO2** field shows a positive amount. After you post the document, on the **Sustainability Ledger Entry** page, the entries have negative values and the **Document Type** field shows **GHG Credit**.  

### Sustainability journals

To work with sustainability journals, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you intend to post in the same batch.  
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **GHG Credit**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only nonblocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory. Choose the account to which you post carbon credits.
5. Select the **Manual Input** checkbox, and then enter the value you want to post as a carbon credit to the **Emission CO2** field.  
6. Post the journal.

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Invoicing prepayments

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order, or you can distribute the prepayment across each line on the order. You can also send additional prepayment invoices if, for example, additional items are added to the order. You can increase quantities or add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete a line for which a prepayment has already been invoiced, you must issue a prepayment credit memo before you can delete the line.

# Set up contact sync with Outlook for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In this article, you learn how to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to synchronize contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with contacts in Outlook. For more information the feature, go to [Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook](admin-synchronize-outlook-contacts.md).

## Introduction

Contact synchronization requires using the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with Exchange Online. Previously, basic authentication was also supported, but it's been deprecated and no longer supported with Exchange Online. You can read more about the deprecation at [Deprecation of Basic authentication in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online). This change means that contact synchronization in Business Central may have stopped working on your on-premises environment. This article will explain how to get it working again.

## Prerequisites

- Exchange Online, either a standalone version or through Microsoft 365 plan  
- Access to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Exchange Online
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users have a Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online email account, which is assigned to their accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of user profile in the **Users** list. 

## Set up contact sync

Complete the following steps to set up contact sync. If you're running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (v.14), you'll have to do an extra step that either modifies application code or sets up a connection to Power BI.

1. <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app for Exchange Online API in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

   In this step, you add a registered app in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, Exchange Online requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and Exchange Online.

   Follow the detailed instructions in the developer and IT pro help at [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory). As you go through the instructions, remember the following points:

   - If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set up the app with the Office 365 Exchange Online permissions described in the next bullet.

   - Configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the Office 365 Exchange Online API:

     - Contacts.ReadWrite
     - EWS.AccessAsUser.All

2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 14, do one of the following tasks:

   - Modify page 6700 by changing `FALSE` to `TRUE` in the following line of code in the `OnPageOpen` trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Create new page with the following code on the OnPageOpen trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Set up Power BI by following the instructions at [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](across-working-with-business-central-in-powerbi.md).

   After the solution you choose is in place, ask users to either run the new/modified page or [connect to Power BI](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect). They'll only need to do this step once.

# Set up digital vouchers

Administrators can use digital voucher functionality to require that documents are attached to specific transactions when they're posted. Therefore, this functionality allows for a source-driven approach and provides a better audit trail. Different types of enforcement can be configured for this purpose, depending on the documents or journal types.

The term *digital voucher* refers to a digital or electronic form of a traditional voucher in accounting. A voucher is a document that's used to support and authorize financial transactions. For accountants, vouchers typically serve as evidence of an expenditure or a receipt of funds. The voucher might include details such as the date of the transaction, a description, the amount, and any authorization signatures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some countries and regions might have legal requirements for specific setups, which might restrict you from configuring some options. If you encounter these restrictions, look for a detailed explanation on the documentation page for your country or region.

## Enable digital vouchers

Follow these steps to enable digital voucher functionality.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Set up digital vouchers

You can use different setups for the documents and journals described in the following table.

| Entry type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Sales Document | Specifies postings that are completed from sales documents. |
| Purchase Document | Specifies postings that are completed from purchase documents. |
| General Journal | Specifies postings that are completed from the general journal for all account types, except types related to customers and vendors. If you select one of those account types, you change control of the posting process. If you select **Customer** as the account type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup for sales journals. If you select **Vendor** as the account type, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your setup for purchase journals. |
| Sales Journal | Specifies the postings that are completed from the sales journal and the general journal where **Customer** is selected as the account type. |
| Purchase Journal | Specifies the postings that are completed from the purchase journal and the general journal where **Vendor** is selected as the account type. |

Follow these steps to define how your organization uses enforced digital vouchers.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Digital Voucher Entry Setup**, and then select the related link. Alternatively, on the **Digital Voucher Setup** page, select **Entry Setup**.
2. In the **Entry Type** column, select an option.
3. In the **Check Type** column, select an enforcement option. If you select **None**, you can post the selected type of entry without a digital voucher. If you select **Attachment**, the entry must include an attachment. If you select **Attachment or Note**, you can include an attachment or a note for the entry. 
4. Select the **Generate Automatically** checkbox to generate the digital voucher automatically. For example, if you don't want to manually add a sales invoice to your transaction, select this checkbox. Then, you just have to post the document. The system automatically creates the document, based on your report layout, and attaches it to the transaction.
5. Select the **Skip If Manually Added** checkbox if you don't want to add an automatically generated digital voucher if the user already added a manual attachment.

### Use source codes for setup

To use enforcement for journals, but not for all transaction types, connect the specific source code to identify the entry type in the general journal, sales journal, or purchase journal.

Follow these steps to set up specific source codes for digital vouchers.

1. On the **Digital Voucher Entry Setup** page, select **Source Codes**.
2. On the **Voucher Entry Source Codes** page, select the source codes that you want to configure.
3. Close the page.

## Use the functionality

Open a purchase or sales document, and enter information in the required fields. Before you post the document, you must follow these steps to attach a digital voucher.

1. In the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox, select **Attach File**.
2. Drag a file directly onto the **Insert File** page, or browse to the file from this page.

The document is attached to the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox. For each line, you can find the document name and type.

If you accidentally attach the wrong voucher, follow these steps to delete it before you post the document.

1. In the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox from the document line, select **Incoming Document**.
2. On the **Incoming document** page, select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> If attachment of a digital voucher is configured as mandatory, and you try to post documents or journals without attaching a voucher, the system prevents you from posting. You receive the following error message: "Not possible to post without attaching the digital voucher."

### Find attached vouchers in transactions

You can find the attached voucher from the posted document or from the **General Ledger Entries** page by looking in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

You can't delete an attached document after posting is completed. However, you can add more attachments after posting is completed.

### Use digital vouchers with recurring journals

To use enforced digital vouchers with general recurring journals, follow these steps to ensure that your setup works as you expect.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then select the related link.  
2. To remove the link between the incoming document and the journal when you post the journal, select the **Unlink Incoming Documents On Posting** checkbox for the template. If you don't select this checkbox, digital vouchers stay linked to journal lines after you post them.

# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Sustainability certificates

In today’s business landscape, sustainability is more than a trend - it’s a necessity. As companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and meet growing consumer demand for responsible practices, sustainability certificates are now an essential tool for validating these efforts. These certificates serve as an independent verification that a company or its products meet specific environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, fostering trust and transparency in the marketplace.  

Sustainability certificates offer a clear and measurable way to assess the environmental and ethical credentials of both companies and their products. By prioritizing vendors who hold recognized sustainability certifications, businesses can enhance their supply chain integrity, reduce risks, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Sustainability certificates for companies cover a wide range of criteria, including resource efficiency, waste management, emissions reduction, and social responsibility. Similarly for products, these certifications ensure that items meet stringent environmental standards, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal. 

## Sustainability certificate area 

The *sustainability certificate area* refers to the specific area covered by a particular certificate. Generally, this method is used to categorize similar certificates based on distinct characteristics. To create new sustainability certificate area, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Areas**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Areas** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate area. 
3. Close the page.   

## Sustainability certificate standards

The *Sustainability certificate standard* refers to the specific standard for a particular certificate.

# Manage attachments, links, and notes on cards and documents

On most list pages, cards, and documents, you can attach files, add links, and write notes on the **Attachments** tab of the **FactBox** pane. The number in the tab title indicates how many attached files, links, or notes exist for the card or document.

On the **Lines** FastTab, you can also use the **Attachments** action to attach documents to a specific line. For example, you might want to attach design specifications to an item on a purchase invoice.

Attachments, links, and notes stay attached to the card or document while it's processed into other states. For example, from an ongoing sales order to a posted sales invoice. However, none of the attachment types are output from the system, for example, when printing or when saving to a file.

You can also add attachments to the emails you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you send an email directly from a document, such as a sales quote, the **Add file from source document** action lets you choose files that are attached to it. You can only choose files that are attached to the document. You can't choose files that are attached to lines.

> [!NOTE]
> When you partially ship and invoice a sales or purchase order, the attachment will only be attached to the final invoice of the order. Similarly, when you invoice deferrals, the attachment is attached to the G/L entries for the document but not for the deferral entries.
>
> If you delete an order before it is invoiced, the attachment is also removed.
>
> When you use the **Get Receipt Lines** action on a purchase invoice, the attachment on the related purchase order is added to the purchase invoice.

## Attach a file to a purchase invoice

You can attach any type of file, such as text, image, or video files, to a card, document, or a line on a document. This is useful, for example, when you want to store a vendor's invoice as a PDF file on the related purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached with the Incoming Documents feature aren't included on the **Attachments** tab. Learn more in [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md). The same is true for files that are attached to lines on documents.

The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your attachment is specific to a line on a document, you can attach it to the line. Select the line, and then choose the **Attachments** action.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to.
1. On the **FactBox** pane, choose the **Attachments** tab.
1. Do one of the following steps:

   - Select **Documents**, and then select **Upload files**. 
   - Select **Documents**, select **Show details**, and then select **Attach files**.
1. On the **Select files** dialog box, do one of the following steps to attach a file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The file is now attached to the purchase invoice.

## View an attached file

1. On the FactBox, select the **Attachments** tab.
1. Under **Documents**, select the attachment you want to view.

   If you select a PDF file, it opens in your browser. Other files download to your device, where you can open them.

## Save a document as a PDF attachment

Whenever you need to save a document as a file, you can use the **Attach as PDF** action to capture the current document content as a PDF file attached to the FactBox of the document. This is useful, for example, when documents follow multiple steps in a process, such as a sales process or an approval workflow, and you want to refer to a printout of the previous step.

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all supported documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a sales order, and then choose the **Attach as PDF** action.

A PDF file with the current content of the sales order is added to the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.

## To add a link from an item card

You can add a link from a card or document to any URL. This is useful, for example, when you want to link an item card with the supplier's item catalog.

The following procedure is based on an item card. The steps are similar for all other supported cards and documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item that you want to add a link from, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Links**, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Link Address** field, enter the link.

    The link must be a valid internet or intranet URL.

5. In the **Description** field, enter any information about the link.  
6. Select the **OK** button.

The link is now attached to the item card.  

## Write a note on a sales order

You can write a note on a document or card, for example, to communicate special instructions to other users of the document or card. You can include file links and URLs in notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on the **Attachments** tab aren't related to internal notes functionality, which is mainly used to communicate between workflow users. Learn more in [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to write a note on, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Notes** section, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Note** field, write any text, such as "This is an urgent order."
5. Select the **OK** button.

The note is now attached to the sales order.

# Transfer bank funds

You might sometimes need to transfer an amount from one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to another. To do this, you must post the transaction on the **General Journals** page. The task varies depending on whether the bank accounts use the same currency or different currencies.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with the same currency code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On a journal line, fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. In the **Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be transferred.

    Next, you must specify the balancing account. If you can't see the relevant fields, then choose the **Show More Columns** action to view all available fields.
6. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. Post the journal.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with different currency codes

To transfer funds between bank accounts that use different currencies, you must post two general journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create two journal lines, and fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. On the first journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some companies prefer to transfer between accounts on separate journal lines. Other companies prefer to post everything on one journal line by using a balancing account. Check with your local expert if you're not sure what to do.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a balancing account, then set the **Bal. Account Type** field to **Bank Account**, and set the **Bal. Account No.** field to the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds. Then proceed to step 9 or 10.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a separate journal line, then move on to the next step.
6. On the second journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
9. If the exchange rates used in the journal are different than the exchange rates on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, enter a new journal line for the exchange rate gain or loss.  

    1. Enter **G/L Account** in the **Account Type** field.  

    2. Enter the G/L account number for exchange rate gain or loss in the **Account No.** field.  

    3. Enter the exchange rate gain or loss in the **Amount** field with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
10. Post the journal.

# Convert Existing Locations to Warehouse Locations
You can enable an existing inventory location to use zones and bins and to operate as a warehouse location.  

The batch job to enable a location for warehouse operation creates initial warehouse entries for the warehouse adjustment bin for all items that have inventory in the location. These initial entries will be balanced when warehouse physical inventory entries are entered after the batch job is run.  

You can create zones and bins either before or after the conversion. The only bin that you must create before the conversion is the one that is to be used as the future adjustment bin.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To clear all negative inventory and any open warehouse documents before you convert the location for warehouse handling, run a report to identify the items with negative inventory and open warehouse documents for the location. For more information, see Check on Negative Inventory.  

## To enable an existing location to operate as a warehouse location  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Warehouse Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Code** field, specify the location that you want to enable for warehouse processing.  
3.  In the **Adjustment Bin Code** field, specify the bin at the location where unsynchronized warehouse entries are stored. For more information, see the [To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).  

    Using the open item ledger entries for the specified location, warehouse journal lines are created that sum up every combination of Item No., Variant Code, Unit of Measure Code, and, if necessary, Lot No. and Serial No. in the item ledger entries. The warehouse journal lines are then posted. This posting creates warehouse entries that place the inventory in the warehouse adjustment bin. The **Adjustment Bin Code** on the location card is also set.  

4.  To see which items were added to the adjustment bin during the batch job, run the **Warehouse Adjustment Bin** report.  
5.  When the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job has completed, perform and post a warehouse physical inventory. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  It is recommended that you run the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job at a time when it will not impact the daily work in the system. This job processes each entry in the **Item Ledger Entry** table, and if there are a large number of item ledger entries, the job can last several hours.  

 For those locations that did not use warehouse management documents before the conversion, you must re-open and release any source documents that were partially received or partially shipped before the conversion.

# Manage master data synchronization

After you set up master data synchronization, when you synchronize for the first time [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

- Couples records in the selected tables.
- Creates a recurring job queue entry for each table.

The job queue entries automatically synchronize data in the subsidiary companies when someone makes a change in the source company. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> For the automatic synchronization to work, the user who makes the change in the source company must have:
>
> - A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
> - Permission sets that allow them to reschedule a background task in the subsidiary company. To learn more about the required license and permissions, go to [Before you start](admin-set-up-data-sync.md#before-you-start).
>
> Otherwise, the change happens in the next unconditional synchronization run. The unconditional synchronization is controlled by the **Inactivity Timeout Period** field on the job queue entry.

However, sometimes things go wrong, and there might be situations that you need to manage or investigate. For example, if people change the same record in both the source company and a subsidiary, synchronization fails so that you can specify the change that's correct. Or, the source company might install an extension that changes the schema of one of the tables you're synchronizing by adding a field or two. If you want to synchronize the new fields in the subsidiaries, install the same extensions and update the table schemas in their setup.

This article describes the tools you can use to keep synchronization running smoothly.

## Overwrite local changes

You can use the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on the fields and tables you synchronize to allow data from the source company to overwrite data in the subsidiary company.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable the synchronization of a field and allow the subsidiary to write values in it independently from the source company. You must either disable synchronization for the field, or allow the source company to overwrite local changes.

## Update table schemas

If the source company changes a table, for example, by adding a field that you want to synchronize, subsidiaries must update their field mappings. On the **Synchronization Fields** page, use the **Update Fields** action.

## Enable or disable couplings between records

To start or stop coupling on specific records on a table, on the **Synchronization Fields** page, choose the fields, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

## Run a full synchronization

The **Run Full Synchronization** action schedules a synchronization for all of the table records in the source company, and resynchronizes all records unconditionally. For example, resynchronization is useful if you enable an extra field on a synchronization table, or add an extra field by using the **Update Fields** action. The action retroactively synchronizes the data in those fields.

## Synchronize modified records

If you change a setting for a table or field in a subsidiary, you must update the synchronization. To update the synchronization, use the **Synchronize Modified Records** action on the **Synchronization Tables** page.

The **Synchronize Modified Records** action schedules a synchronization of the following table records:

* Records that failed to synchronize in the last attempt.
* Records that were changed in the source company after the last scheduled synchronization. You can review the last scheduled synchronization time on the **Synchronization Tables** page in the **Synchronize Changes Since** field.

The action works in the same way as a scheduled synchronization, and you can use it as a way to synchronize outside the schedule. For example, if you select the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on a field to allow data from the source company to overwrite local changes, the action updates that data. You can also just wait until the next scheduled synchronization happens.

## Investigate the status of synchronization

There are two actions on the **Synchronization Tables** page that can help you monitor your synchronization:

* **Integration Synchronization Jobs**
* **Job Queue Entries**

The following table describes the actions.

|Page  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Integration Synchronization Jobs**     | Open the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page to investigate what happened each time a job queue entry ran. To dig deeper into the details about new records that were added, or explore why a record failed to synchronize, choose the numbers in the **Inserted** or **Failed** columns. You can also use this page to clean up older records that you might not need. To learn more about cleaning up, go to [Clean up old entries](#clean-up-old-entries).        |
|**Job Queue Entries**     | Access details about the job queue entry that synchronize data for a selected table. For example, use this page to manage the status of the job queue entry,    To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you find an error on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page that you can't resolve yourself, if you contact your partner or Microsoft for support, it's helpful to provide the error message and callstack information.

## Clean up old entries

Over time, the number of entries in the synchronization log will become large, so you might want to do a little housekeeping to remove unneeded entries. To make it easier to clean up old entries, the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page offers the following actions:

* **Delete Entries Older Than 7 Days**
* **Delete All Entries**

## Adding extensions

If the source company installs a new extension, the subsidiary must also install it if they want to synchronize data for it. The subsidiary can use the **Update Fields** action On the **Synchronization Fields** page to add the tables from the extension to the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Some tables get data from related tables. If you add an extension that doesn't include related tables, the fields on those tables aren't available. Verify that you added all related tables.

<!--
## Recreate a deleted job queue entry

If the recurring job queue entry is deleted for a table, you can quickly recreate it. On the **Synchronization Tables** page, choose the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action.
-->

# Restrict and allow usage of a record

If you want to restrict a record from being used in certain activities, for example, until the record has been approved, you can add two workflow responses in the workflow that controls the use of the record. One workflow response restricts usage of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. The other workflow response allows the use of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. Two responses exist in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for this purpose: **Add record restriction** and **Remove record restriction**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers support for restricting a record from being posted, from being exported as a payment, and from being printed as a check. To support other restrictions, a Microsoft partner must customize the application code.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The workflow functionality to restrict and allow records from being used is not related to the functionality to block item, customer, and vendor records from being posted.

The following procedure describes how to restrict purchase orders from being posted until they've been approved. The new workflow is based on the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

## Create a workflow step that restricts posting of unapproved purchase orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, choose the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

   Note that the first two workflow steps are about restricting and then allowing usage of purchase invoices. Change the event condition on the first step of the new workflow to specify that it applies to purchase orders.  
4. On the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, choose the **On Condition** field for the first step, then, for the **Document Type** filter, select **Order**.  
5. Proceed to edit, delete, or add other workflow steps to reflect a business process that begins by restricting unapproved purchase orders from being posted.

# Count and adjust inventory using documents

You can take a physical inventory of your items by using physical inventory order and physical inventory recording documents. The **Physical Inventory Order** page is used to organize the complete inventory counting project, for example one per location. Use the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page capture and communicate the actual count of items. You can create multiple recordings for one order, for example, to distribute groups of items to different employees.

You can print the **Physical Invt. Recording** report from each recording, and it contains empty quantity fields where you can enter the counted inventory. When you're done counting and the quantities are entered on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page, choose the **Finish** action. This action transfers the quantities to the related lines on the **Physical Inventory Order** page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]ensures that you can't record an item count twice.  

> [!NOTE]
> Using documents to perform a physical inventory count provides more control and supports distributing the counting to multiple employees. You can also use journals to perform the task, such as the **Phys. Inventory Journals** and **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journals** pages. To learn more, go to [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md). This article describes how to use documents to do a physical inventory count.
>
> If you're using zones in your warehouse, you can't use physical inventory orders. Instead, use the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page to count your warehouse entries before you synchronize them with item ledger entries.

Counting inventory by using documents consists of the following overall steps:

1. Create a physical inventory order with expected item quantities prefilled.
2. Generate one or more physical inventory recordings from the order.
3. Enter the counted item quantities on the recordings, as captured on print-outs, for example, and set it to **Finished**.
4. Complete and post the physical inventory order.

## To create a physical inventory order

A physical inventory order is a complete document that consists of a physical inventory order header and order lines. The information on a physical inventory header describes how to take the physical inventory. The order lines contain the information about the items and their locations.

To create the physical inventory order lines, you typically use the **Calculate Lines** action to add the current inventory as lines on the order. You can also use the **Copy from Document** action to fill in the lines with the content of another open or posted physical inventory order. The following procedure only describes how to use the **Calculate Lines** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the required fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Calculate Lines**.
5. Select options as necessary.
6. Set filters, for example, to only include a subset of items to count with the first recording.

    > [!TIP]
    > To plan for multiple employees to count the inventory, set different filters each time you use the **Calculate Lines** action to fill in the order with the subset of inventory items that a user will record. Then, as you generate multiple physical inventory recordings for multiple employees, you minimize the risk of counting items twice. To learn more, go to [To create a physical inventory recording](#to-create-a-physical-inventory-recording).

7. Choose the **OK** button.

A line for each item that exists on the chosen location and per the set filters and options is added to the order. For items that are set up for item tracking, the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected and information about the expected quantity of serial and lot numbers is available by choosing **Lines**, and then **Item Tracking Lines**. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).

You can now create one or more recordings, which are instructions to the employees who do the counting.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use package-specific tracking, you can also use documents to count and adjust inventory with package numbers. To start using this feature, you must turn on **Feature Update: Enable use of package tracking in physical inventory orders** on the **Feature Management** page. Existing physical inventory orders are updated, however, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't populate the **Package No.** field. You must recreate these lines using the **Calculate Lines** action on the **Physical Inventory Order** page.
>
> You can enter the package number for items where package tracking is needed on the **Phys. Inventory Recording Lines** page. Choose **Finish** to finalize recording.
>
> After you choose **Finish** on the **Physical Inventory Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates differences with respect to the package and other item tracking details, and makes positive or negative adjustments.

## To create a physical inventory recording

For each physical inventory order, you can create one or more physical inventory recording documents on which employees enter the counted quantities. Employees can enter quantities either manually, or with a scanning device.

By default, a recording is created for all the lines on the related physical inventory order. To avoid that two employees count the same items if you distribute counting, gradually fill in the physical inventory order by setting filters on the **Calculate Lines** batch job. Then create the physical inventory recording with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected. This setting ensures that each new recording contains different items than those on other recordings.

For manual counting, you can print the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report, which has an empty column where warehouse employees can write the counted quantities. When counting is complete, you enter the recorded quantities on the related lines on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page. Lastly, you transfer the recorded quantities to the related physical inventory order by setting the status to **Finished**.

1. On a **Physical Inventory Order** page that contains lines for the items to be counted in one recording, you need to choose the **Make New Recording** action.
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Make New Recording**.
1. Select options and set filters as necessary.
1. Choose the **OK** button.
1. For every set of items to be counted, load them on the related physical inventory order and repeat steps 1 through 3 with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to open the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page.
1. Open the relevant recording.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
1. For items that use item tracking, create an additional line for each lot number or serial number code by choosing the **Functions** action, and then the **Copy Line** action. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).  
1. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the physical document that employees can use to note the quantities they count.

## To finish a physical inventory recording

After employees count the quantities, record the quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. From the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page, select the physical inventory recording that you want to finish, and then choose the **Edit** action.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the actual counted quantity in the **Quantity** field for each line.
3. For items with serial or lot numbers (the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected), enter the counted quantities on the lines for the item's serial and lot numbers respectively. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).
4. Select the **Recorded** checkbox on each line.
5. When you have entered all data for a physical inventory recording, choose the **Finish** action. Note that all lines must have the **Recorded** checkbox selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you finish a physical inventory recording, each line is transferred to the line on the related physical inventory order that matches it exactly. To match, the values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields must be the same on the recording and the order lines.>
    > 
    > If a matching physical inventory order line doesn't exist, and if the **Allow Recording Without Order** checkbox is selected, a new line is added and the **Recorded Without Order** checkbox on the related physical inventory order line is selected. Otherwise, an error message displays and the process is canceled.>
    > If more than one physical inventory recording lines match a physical inventory order line, then a message displays and the process is canceled. If, for some reason, two identical physical inventory lines end up on the physical inventory order, you can use a action to resolve it. To learn more, go to [To find duplicate physical inventory order lines](#to-find-duplicate-physical-inventory-order-lines).

## To complete a physical inventory order

After you finish a physical inventory recording, the **Qty. Recorder (Base)** field on the related physical inventory order is updated with the counted (recorded) values, and the **On Recording Lines** checkbox is selected. If a counted quantity differs from the expected quantity, the **Pos Qty. (Base)** and **Neg Qty. (Base)** fields show the difference.

To access the expected quantities and any recorded differences for items with item tracking, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose **Item Tracking Lines** to select various views for the serial and lot numbers in the physical inventory count.

You can also choose the **Phys. Inventory Order Diff.** action to view any differences between the expected quantity and the counted quantity.

### To find duplicate physical inventory order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the physical inventory order to view duplicate lines for.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Other**, and then choose **Show Duplicate Lines**.

Duplicate physical inventory order lines display so that you can delete them and keep only one line with a unique set of values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields.

### To post a physical inventory order

After you complete a physical inventory order and change its status to **Finished**, you can post it. You can only set the status of a physical inventory order to **Finished** under the following conditions:

- All related physical inventory recordings have a status of **Finished**.
- Each physical inventory order line is counted by at least one inventory recording line.
- The **In Recording Lines** and the **Qty. Exp. Calculated** checkboxes are selected for all physical inventory order lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the physical inventory order that you want to complete, and then choose the **Edit** action.

    On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the quantity recorded shows in the **Qty. Recorded (Base)** field.
3. Choose the **Finish** action.

    The value in the **Status** field is **Finished**. You can now only change the order by choosing the **Reopen** action.
4. To post the order, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The item ledger entries are updated along with any related item tracking entries.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

### To view posted physical inventory orders

After posting, the physical inventory order is deleted and you can view and evaluate the document as a posted physical inventory order. The posted order includes its physical inventory recordings and any comments made.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders** page, select the posted inventory order to view, and then choose the **View** action.
3. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to view a list of related physical inventory recordings.  

## Handle item tracking when counting inventory

Item tracking relates to the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to items. When you count an item that's stored in inventory as, for example, 10 different lot numbers, employee must be able to record which and how many units of each lot number are on inventory. To learn more, go to [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

The **Use Item Tracking** checkbox on physical inventory order lines is automatically selected if an item tracking code is set up for the item. You can select or clear the checkbox manually.

### Example - Prepare a physical inventory recording for an item-tracked item

Consider a physical inventory for Item A, which is stored in inventory as ten different serial numbers.

1. On the recording line for the item, select the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox.
2. Choose the **Serial No.** field, select the first serial number that exists in inventory for the item, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Copy the line for the first item-tracked item to insert additional lines that correspond to the number of serial numbers that are stored in inventory.

3. Choose the **Functions** action, and then choose **Copy Line**.
4. On the **Copy Phys. Invt. Rec. Line** page, enter **9** in the **No. of Copies** field, and then choose the **OK** button.
5. On the first line, in the **Serial No.** field, select the next serial number for the item.
6. Repeat step 5 for the remaining eight serial numbers. Be sure you don't select the same number twice.
7. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the print-out that employees use to write down the counted items and serial/lot numbers.

Notice that the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report contains ten lines for Item A, one for each serial number.

### Example - Record and post counted lot number differences

A lot-tracked item is stored in inventory with the "LOT" number series.

**Expected Inventory**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT1003|30|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|120|

**Recorded Quantities**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT0002|12|
|LOT1003|20|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|112|

**Quantities to Post**:

|Lot No.|Expected Quantity|Recorded Quantity|Quantity to Post|
|-|-|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|80|0|
|LOT1002|0|12|+12|
|LOT1003|30|20|-10|
|LOT1006|10|0|-10|
|Total|120|112|-8|

On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the **Neg. Qty. (Base)** field contains **8**. For the order line, the **Phys. Invt. Item Track. List** page shows the positive or negative quantities for each lot number.

## Inventory documents

The following types of documents are useful for managing your warehouse:

* Use **inventory receipts** to register positive adjustments of items based on the quality, quantity, and cost.
* Use **inventory shipments** to write off missing or damaged goods.

You can print these documents at any stage, release, and reopen them, and assign common values such as dimensions in the header. To reprint the documents after they're posted, use the **Posted Inventory Receipt** and **Posted Inventory Shipment** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use these documents, you must specify a number series to create their identifiers. To learn more, go to [To set up numbering for inventory documents](#to-set-up-numbering-for-inventory-documents).

title: How to post service orders
description: When you have created a service order, filled in all the necessary information and made any modifications, you can post the service order.

# Post service orders and credit memos

After you create a service order, when you're ready you can post it. The order must contain at least one service item line and one service line. If the order has more than one service line, all lines post at the same time.  

If you have a large number of service orders, you can save time by using a batch job to post them. You can run the batch job from any service order.

> [!Tip]
> Before you post a service document, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to to check for errors or missing information. If there are errors, you must correct the problem. You can print a new test report to verify the fix, and then post the document.

## To post a service order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order.  
3. On the **Service Order** page, choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Result**|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**Test Report** | Checks all parts of the document and presents the result in a report. If the report indicates any errors or a lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.|  
    |**Post** | Posts the order without printing a shipment or an invoice.|  
    |**Post and Print** | Posts the order and prints a shipment (if you ship the order without invoicing it) or an invoice (if you invoice the order).|  
    |**Post Batch** | Posts multiple service orders at one time once.|  

4. For the **Post** action, there are several options that control what happens.  

    |**Posting Option**|**Result**|  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    |**Ship** | Posts shipment of the items.|  
    |**Invoice** | Invoices items that have already been shipped.|  
    |**Ship and Invoice** | Invoices and ships the items.|  
    |**Ship and Consume** | Posts shipment and consumption on the order. It updates the relevant quantities on the service lines of the order and on the previously posted service shipment document.|  

You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that shipped but isn't invoiced or consumed.  

When you post the order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents and updates the service order.  

## To batch post service orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Post Batch** action.  
3. You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
4. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

## To post a service credit memo  

After you create a service credit memo, you can post it when you're ready. If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting, an error message displays and stops the process.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the necessary fields.  
4. Choose the **Post** action. If you want to print the credit memo at the same time as your post, choose the **Post and Print** action instead.  
5. To test credit memos before you post them, choose **Test Report**. When you run the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the posting dates in the document.  
6. To post several service credit memos at the same time, run the **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos** batch job. Using the batch job is helpful when you have to post a lot of credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to enter all the necessary information on the credit memos before you batch post them. Otherwise, it is possible that they will not be posted. When the batch job finishes, a message shows how many of the service credit memos it posted.  

## To post consumption from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to post the items, resource hours, and costs used for a specific service operation for which you won't charge your customer. You can post consumed items, hours, or costs only for a posted shipment that has no posted invoices or consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to post consumption for.  
3. Choose the service item. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and specify the quantities for which you'll post consumption in the **Qty. to Consume** field. The quantity can't be larger than the quantity already shipped and the quantity remaining but not invoiced after partial invoicing of this shipment.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To register consumption for a project, fill in the **Project No.**, **Project Task No.**, and the **Project Line Type** fields on the service line.  

5. Choose the lines to post, and then choose the **Post** action. On the page that opens, select **Ship and Consume**.  

The service is posted as either partially or fully consumed, depending on the value in the **Qty. to Consume** field, and the relevant ledger entries are created. Also, previously posted service shipment documents are updated chronologically with the consumed quantities. The relevant quantities are updated on the service lines of the order.  

## To post shipments from service orders  

After you specify the details of a service, you can adjust and post the quantities of items used, time spent, and costs incurred. As a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes the necessary changes to reflect the new state of your inventory and current status of the specific order processing.  

The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that aren't set up to require warehouse handling.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the **Service Lines** page, find the required entries and then specify the quantity to post in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The quantity to ship value depends on whether you want to fully or partially post the shipment. If you choose to ship fully, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field must be equal to the value in the **Quantity** field. When you post a partial shipment, you must specify the quantity you want to ship initially. If you already shipped part of the service on the order, make a note of the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field. The maximum quantity you can enter in the **Quantity to Ship** field is the number of units that haven't shipped.  

4. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Ship**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates ledger entries (in the warranty ledger, item ledger, service ledger, or G/L), produces the posted service shipment document, and updates the relevant fields on the service lines of the service order.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, shipping and moving service line items works in the same way as they do for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, and therefore require two different release functions. To learn more about shipping service line items in advanced warehouse configurations, go to [Picking Items for Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).  

## Combine shipments from multiple service orders into a single service invoice

If needed, you can gather posted shipments that you haven't invoiced in a single invoice. For example, combining shipments can reduce the overall number of invoices to process, which can lower administrative costs and save time for your bookkeeping team. To learn more, go to [Combine shipments on a single invoice](sales-how-to-combine-shipments-on-a-single-invoice.md).

## To undo posted consumption  

You can cancel the consumption on the service orders. For example, because it was posted by mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted.  
3. Choose the **Service Shipment Lines** action.  
4. Choose the lines that contain the incorrect consumption, and then choose the **Undo Consumption** action.  

 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can't undo service consumption if:  

> * The service order has been closed.  
> * It was posted to a project, so there are project ledger entries linked to it.  

## To post service lines  

If you have to work on a service order for a considerable time without posting it, you might want to post some of the service lines linked to it as a way, for example, of keeping your inventory updated. You can post by specifying the relevant quantities on the lines to be posted. You might choose to post the lines one by one or by selecting several lines at a time.  

The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up. If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document, depending on the location setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the lines you're going to post, fill in the **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume** fields, depending on how you post the lines.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.

# Managing payables

A large part of managing accounts payable is paying your vendors, or reimbursing your employees for expenses. You can use functions to add payments lines for purchase invoices that are due on the **Payment Journal** page. To send transactions to your bank, you can export multiple payment journal lines to a file, and then upload the file to your bank. You can also make payments by check, including transmitting checks as electronic payments.

Another typical task is to apply outgoing payments to their related vendor or employee ledger entries in order to close purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, or employee accounts as paid. You can do this on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file to register the payments. The payments are applied to open vendor, customer, or employee ledger entries by matching payment text and entry information. There are various ways to review and change the matches before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

Alternatively, you can apply outgoing payments manually on the **Payment Journal** page or from the related vendor or employee ledger entries.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks within accounts payable, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis)

## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Emission overview (sum by category)](#example-emission-overview-sum-by-category) | Analyze your emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Average emissions by category](#example-average-emissions-by-category) | Analyze your average emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Emissions by scope](#example-emissions-by-scope) | Analyze your emissions by scope. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Emission Scope**, **Account Category**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|

## Example: Emission overview (sum by category)

To analyze your emissions by category, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) page and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Account Category** and **Account Name** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the fields **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O** to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Emission overview (sum)** or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# Plan for New Demand Order by Order

This planning task can be performed on the **Order Planning** page, which displays all new demand along with availability information and suggestions for supply. It provides the visibility and tools needed to effectively plan demand from sales lines and component lines and then create different types of supply orders directly.  

You can enter the **Order Planning** page in two ways depending on your focus: From an order that you want to plan for specifically or in batch mode because you want to plan for all and any new demand.  


## To plan for new production order demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. (You can perform these steps for planned, firm planned, or released production orders).
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

The page displays planning lines according to the view filter **Production Demand**, meaning unfulfilled component lines of all existing production orders. Demand for only the one production order is not shown because it is necessary to plan for one production order with an overview of demand for potentially earlier components lines. Planning lines for the production order in context are expanded.  

## To plan for any new demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.
3. Choose the **Expand (+)** button in front of the date in the **Demand Date** field to see the underlying planning lines that represent demand lines with insufficient availability.  
4. For each expanded planning line, that is, demand line, you can see values in information fields at the bottom of the page.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Qty. on Other Locations**|Shows if the item exists on another location. You can then look up and select it.|  
    |**Substitutes Exist**|Shows if a substitute item is created for the item. You can then look up and select it. Note that this feature only applies to components, that is, from demand lines of type **Production**.|  
    |**Quantity Available**|Shows the total availability of the item, that is, the Projected Available Balance.|  
    |**Earliest Date Available**|Shows the arrival date of an inbound supply order that can cover the needed quantity on a date later than the demand date.|  

5. In the **Replenishment System** field, select which type of supply order to create.  

    The default value is that of the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of three options:  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchase**|Creates a purchase order.|  
    |**Transfer**|Creates a transfer order.|  
    |**Prod. Order**|Creates a production order.|  

    In the **Supply From** field you must select a value according to the selected replenishment system.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the field is not filled in, the system will display an error message when you use the **Make Supply Order** function, and no supply order will be created for the planning line in question. This, however, is not the case if the replenishment system is **Prod. Order**.  

6. From the **Supply From** field, you can look up in the relevant list and select where the supply should come from:  

    - If replenishment system is **Purchase**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page.  
    - If replenishment system is **Transfer**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Location List** page.  

    In case the item exists in another location, the **Qty. on Other Location** field at the bottom shows a value and you can then look up and select the location from which the item should be supplied when you make the transfer order.  

    If a substitute exists for the demanded item, the **Substitute Exists** field is set to **Yes**, and you can then look up to the **Item Substitution Entries** page and select the substitute.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

7. Select the **Reserve** check box if you want to make a reservation between the supply order you are creating and the demand line that it is created for. It is empty by default.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only select this check box if the item has **Optional** or **Always** in the **Reserve** field on its item card.  

8. In the **Qty. to Order** field, you can enter the quantity that will go on the supply order you are creating.   
    The default value is the same quantity as that in the **Needed Quantity** field. But you may decide to order more or less than this quantity based on your knowledge of the demand situation. If, for example, you see on the **Order Planning** page that several unrelated demand lines are for the same purchased item, and they are due around the same date, you can consolidate these by entering the total needed quantity in the **Qty. to Order** field of one line, and then delete the other, obsolete planning lines for that item.  

9. In the **Due Date** and **Order Date** fields, you can enter the dates that should apply to the created supply orders.  

    These two fields are interrelated according to the **Default Safety Lead Time** field, which can be found on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. By default, the due date is the same as the demand date, but you can change this as you like.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you enter a date later than the demand date, you will receive a warning message.  

## To make supply orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. You can perform these steps for a planned, firm planned, or released production order.  
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. Place the cursor on a relevant planning line, and then choose the **Make Orders** action.  
4. On the **Make Supply Orders** page, on the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, select one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**The Active Line**|Make a supply order only for the line where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**The Active Order**|Make supply orders for all lines in the order where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**All Lines**|Make supply orders for all lines on the **Order Planning** page.|  

5. On the **Options** FastTab, define what kind of supply orders, or requisition worksheet lines, should be made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The settings you last made on the **Make Supply Orders** page will be saved under your user ID so that they are the same the next time you use the page.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to make the suggested supply orders or requisition worksheet lines.  

You have now planned for the unfulfilled demand by making respective supply orders. Details about specific work flows when using the **Order Planning** page would depend on a company’s internal policies.  

When you have finished your planning work on the **Order Planning** page, for example defined an alternative way to supply the quantity, you can proceed to create supply orders for one or more of the planning lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The supply orders you create may introduce new dependent demand, for example for underlying production orders, and you should therefore choose **Calculate Plan** again to find and resolve this before moving down the list.

# Sharing Business Data from Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data, like a list of records, specific records, or documents. <!--, with others&mdash;even those people who don't have a Business Central license in some cases.-->

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions of Business Central.

## Copying a link

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and distribute it in other forms of media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser's address box.

When you paste the URL into a rich text editor like Word, Outlook, or Teams, instead of displaying the full URL, the link is given a more readable name that clearly indicates context of the target. The name and pattern vary depending on what page you're linking to. Consider the following examples:

|Pattern|Page example|Link name|
|-|-|-|
|List pages|**Items** list page | **Items**|
|List view|	**Open** filtered view on **Sales Orders** list|**Sales Orders - Open**|
| Single record|Item card showing single record|"Item Card - 1896 ∙ ATHENS Desk"|
|Draft records|	New customer card|**New - Customer card**|
|Company that uses badge|**Items** list page for company with badge **CRONUS**| **Items (CRONUS)**|

> [!TIP]
> A similar naming convention is used on browser tabs.

### Share data analysis
If you're viewing a page or query in the data analysis mode, you can share a specific analysis tab by selecting the down arrowhead on the tab, and then selecting **Copy link**. [Learn more about data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). 

### Modify the page link

After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what shows when the page opens. You can, for example, add filters or specify a different company.

[Learn more about the web client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

### About filtered lists

Using the filter pane on list pages, you can apply filters to narrow-down the records shown in the list. If you use the **Copy Link** action or copy the URL from the browser, the page link won't include your filter changes. Users that open the link see the full collection. The way to keep the filtering on a collection page link is to save the filtered page as a **View** first. Then, open the view and copy the link from there.

[Learn more about sorting, searching, and filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## Sharing to Teams

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Not Supported](media/x-icon.png) Business Central On-premises

Directly from most collection pages and details pages, you can send a link to the page to people, group chats or channels. For example, share a link to a filtered view of your records. If you've installed the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, the link will automatically expand into a compact card for you to include with your message. Recipients then select the link or card to open the page in Business Central.

[Learn more about sharing records and page links in Teams](across-working-with-teams.md).

## Sharing Through OneDrive

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Share** opens a page the let's you select who you want to share the file with. Recipients get a notification email to access the file from your OneDrive.

[Learn more about sharing files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).

## Opening in Excel

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

For list pages and lists embedded on a page, you can use the **Open in Excel** action. This action exports the list of records to an Excel workbook (.xlsx file), which you can share with others. In the workbook, you can also use the Share feature that's part of Excel.

[Learn more about viewing and editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).

## Sharing rows or tables

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

You can share one or more records in a list. Just select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy to your clipboard. Then paste what you copied into another application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. For example, copying three sales orders and pasting that into an email will display the orders in a nicely formatted table.

# Sustainability value chain in sales

When you sell items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the **CO2e per Unit** field from the **Item** card for each sales line that contains emission values. It uses the average calculation method to calculate the value.  

When you post all sales documents, the posted documents keep the **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values for each line.

The result of posting shows as a new sustainability value entry for each line that has **Sale** as its **Item Ledger Entry Type**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values aren't used in default report layouts. However, if you want to show these details when you print reports, you can create a new document report to show this data.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Design

Item tracking in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] started with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The item tracking functionality is in a separate object structure with intricate links to posted documents and item ledger entries, and it is integrated with the reservation system, which handles reservation, order tracking, and action messaging. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md) in the Supply Planning design details.  

This design incorporates item tracking entries in total availability calculations throughout the system, including planning, manufacturing, and warehousing. Serial and lot numbers are applied on the item ledger entries to ensure simple access to historical data for item tracking purposes. With 2021 release wave 1, item tracking in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes package numbers.  

With the addition of serial, lot, and package numbers, the reservation system handles permanent item attributes while also handling intermittent links between supply and demand in the form of order tracking entries and reservation entries. Another different characteristic of serial or lot numbers compared to the conventional reservation data is the fact that they can be posted, either partially or fully. Therefore, the **Reservation Entry** table (T337) now works with a related table, the **Tracking Specification** table (T336), which manages and displays summing across active and posted item tracking quantities. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  

The following diagram outlines the design of item tracking functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

![Example of item tracking flow.](media/design_details_item_tracking_design.png "Example of item tracking flow")  

The central posting object is redesigned to handle the unique subclassification of a document line in the form of serial or lot numbers, and special relation tables are added to create the one-to-many relations between posted documents and their split item ledger entries and value ledger entries.  

Codeunit 22, **Item Jnl. – Post Line**, now splits the posting according to the item tracking numbers that are specified on the document line. Each unique item tracking number on the line creates its own item ledger entry for the item. This means that the link from the posted document line to the associated item ledger entries is now a one-to-many relation. This relation is handled by the following item tracking relation tables.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Item Entry Relation** (T6507)|Relates shipped or received lines to item ledger entries|  
|**Value Entry Relation** (T6508)|Relates invoiced lines to value entries|

# Update currency exchange rates

If you trade in different currencies, you need to keep track of the changes in currency exchange rates. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you manage and update the exchange rates manually or automatically and set up a currency exchange rate service.

## Currencies

> [!TIP]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find real-time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates under the term currency. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-def](includes/finance-currencies-def.md)]

You can specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code. For more information, see [Currencies](finance-set-up-currencies.md#curr)

### Example of a receivable currency transaction

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-example](includes/finance-currencies-example.md)]

## Exchange rates

The exchange rates are the tool to calculate the local currency value (LCY) of each currency transaction. The **Currency Exchange Rates** page includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Starting Date**|The date when the currency rate was effective.|  
|**Currency Code**|The currency code related to this exchange rate.|  
|**Relational Currency Code**|If this currency is part of a triangular currency calculation, then you can set up the related currency code here.|  
|**Exchange Rate Amount**|The exchange rate amount is the rate for the currency code selected on the line. Normally 1 or 100.|  
|**Relational Exch. Rate Amount**|The relational exchange rate amount relates to the rate to use for the relational currency code.|  
|**Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Fix Exchange Rate Amount**|Specifies if the currency's exchange rate can be changed on invoices and journal lines.|  

In general, the values of the **Exchange Rate Amount** and **Relational Exchange Rate Amount** fields are used as the default currency rate on all new receivables and payables documents that are created going forward. The document is assigned the currency rate according to the current working date.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:

> `Currency Amount = Amount / Exchange Rate Amount * Relational Exch. Rate Amount`

The adjustment exchange rate amount, or the relational adjustment exchange rate amount, updates all open bank, receivables, or payables transactions.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount * Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt`

## Adjust exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, you need to adjust other currency equivalents periodically. If you don't, amounts you converted from foreign (or other) currencies and posted to the general ledger in local currency can be incorrect. Also, you need to update daily entries posted before you enter a daily exchange rate.

You can use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job to manually adjust the exchange rates for posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. The batch job can also update other reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use a service to update exchange rates automatically. For more information, see [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service). However, this doesn't adjust exchange rates on already posted transactions. To update exchange rates on posted entries, use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.

You can also specify how the adjustment handles dimensions for unrealized gains and losses postings by choosing one of the following options in the **Dimension Posting** field:  

* **Source Entry Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values for G/L entries for unrealized gains and losses from the entry you're adjusting.  
* **No Dimensions**: Don't transfer dimension values for unrealized gains and losses to G/L entries. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still uses default dimension settings, for example, **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**. If the source transaction entries have dimension values, the adjustment creates entries without dimension values.  
* **G/L Account Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values from the unrealized gains and losses G/L account's dimension settings source entry to G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the preview capability, you need to turn on the **Feature Update: Enable use of new extensible exchange rate adjustment, including posting review** feature on the **[Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610)** page.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available in the Swiss version right now, but it's coming soon. We're working on it.

## Preview the effect of an adjustment

You can preview the effect that an exchange rate adjustment has on posting before you actually post by choosing the **Preview Posting** action on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report (Report 596) request page. On the request page, you can specify what to include in the preview:

* Get a detailed posting to the general ledger by entry.
* Get a summarized posting by currency. Just pick the **Adjust per entry** field on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report.

### Effect on customers and vendors

For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job uses the exchange rate that was valid on the posting date specified for the batch job to adjust the currency. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealized Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there's an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry. The new entry reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### Dimensions on customer and vendor ledger entries

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the dimensions from the customer or vendor ledger entries to the adjustment entries, and posts adjustments for each combination of dimension values.

### Effect on bank accounts

For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realized Gains Acc.** field or the **Realized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### Dimensions on bank account entries

The adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and the gain/loss account are assigned the bank account's default dimensions.

### Effect on G/L accounts

If you post in another reporting currency, the batch job can create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between the local currency and the other reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry. It adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

#### Dimensions on G/L account entries

The adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they're posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, you need to enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=e871f958-fe42-4cf3-bb8a-e97f4c7658de]

## Set up a currency exchange rate service

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> Most exchange rate services provide data that is compatible with the import process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, sometimes the data is formatted differently and you need to customize your import process. You can use the data exchange framework to do that by adding your own codeunit. You'll probably need some help from a developer to do that. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **New** action.
3. On the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Map the fields from the XML file to the currency exchange rates table in the source field.
5. Apply any necessary transformation rules.
6. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to enable the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The following video shows how you can connect to a currency exchange rate service, using the European Central Bank as an example. In the segment that describes how to set up field mappings, the setting in the **Source** column for the **Parent Node for Currency Code**  only returns the first currency found. The setting should be `/gesmes:Envelope/Code/Code/Code`.

<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=76914b80-c36a-4d74-95fa-0cdf5c5c0bfa]

## Update currency exchange rates through a service

Follow the steps given to update the currency exchange rates through a service:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

## Correct mistakes

Every now and then you might need to correct a mistake in a payment transaction that's associated with adjustments to foreign currency gains and losses. You can use the **Reverse transaction** action on the **Bank Account Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages to unapply and reverse the payment transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> When you unapply and reverse a payment for an entry that had currency exchange rate adjustments associated with it, the reversal posts reversal entries for the adjustments. You might have to run the currency exchange rate adjustment again to get the correct current balance.

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Actual (Total Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-total-price)
- [**Billable (Invoiced Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#billable-invoiced-price)
- [**Realization %**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-)

# Specify when and how to receive workflow notifications

In workflows that require that someone approves changes, you must set up the approval users who approve or reject changes. For example, you might want someone to approve new records. An important part of the approval user setup is to specify how and when the user is notified of the change. For example, you can specify that an approval user immediately receives an email when someone creates a new customer. You can also schedule notifications to be delivered, for example, on a weekly or monthly basis.

People can also change their notification setup by choosing **Change Notification Settings** on any notification.  

> [!NOTE]
> Notifications are delivered according to the notification settings for the receiver, not the sender. That's an important distinction because it means that when someone requests an approval as part of a workflow, their request is not necessarily sent immediately. Instead, it's delivered according to the notification schedule specified in the approver's notification settings.

Before you can set up an approval user's notification preferences, you must set up the user as an approval user. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> To use email as the notification method, you must set email up for both the sender and the receiver in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

## Steps in workflows

Many approval workflow steps are about notifying users of an event they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a process with the approved record. For workflow steps involving approvals, each notification is tied to an approval entry. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## Specify when and how approval users receive notifications  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line for the user you want to set up notification preferences for, then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
3. On the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you open the **Workflow Notification Setup** page from the **Approval User Setup** page the notification setup is linked to the approval user. The approval user will always receive workflow notifications according to that notification setup. If you use the *Tell Me* feature to open the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, the notification setup applies to all users.

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**Notification Type**|Specify the type of event the notification is about.<br /><br /> Select one of the following options:<br /><br /> -   **New Record** specifies that the notification is about a new record, such as a document, that the user must act on.<br />-   **Approval** specifies that the notification is about one or more approval requests.<br />-   **Overdue** specifies that the notification is to remind users that they're late in acting on an event.|
   |**Notification Method**|Specify if the notification is an email or an internal note.|

   You can define the layout of email notifications by customizing Report 1320, Notification Email. Learn more at [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

   You specified how the user receives notifications. Now specify when the user receives notifications.  
4. Choose the **Notification Schedule** action.  
5. On the **Notification Schedule** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**Recurrence**|Specify the recurring pattern in which notifications are sent to the user.|
   |**Time**|Specify what time of day notifications are sent to the user when the value in the **Recurrence** field is anything other than **Instantly**.|
   |**Daily Frequency**|Specify on which type of days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Daily**.<br /><br /> Select **Weekday** to receive notifications every day of the work week. Select **Daily** to receive notifications every day of the week, including weekends.|
   |**Monday** through **Sunday**|Specify on which days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Weekly**.|
   |**Date of Month**|Specify if the user receives notifications on the first, last, or a specific date of the month.|
   |**Monthly Notification Date**|Specify the date of the month on which the user receives notifications when the value in the **Date of Month** field is **Custom**.|

## Change when and how you receive notifications

1. On one of the notifications you received, either as an email or a note, choose **Change Notification Settings**.  
2. On the **Workflow Notification Setup** page, change your notification preferences as described in steps 3-5 above.
   1. Confirm that the correct notification is chosen under the **Notification Type** field.
   2. Choose whether to receive an email or note notification under the  **Notification Method** field.
   3. Select the **Notification Schedule** to change the frequency and recurrence in which notifications are sent.

# Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data 

Copilot in Business Central uses AI from the Azure OpenAI Service, hosted and operated by Microsoft and built with enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance controls. This article explains the data that the service processes when you use Copilot.

## How Business Central communicates with Azure OpenAI Service

Each time you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any data needed for Copilot to perform the task, are sent to the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint.

- Each request to Copilot, such as a chat message or a request to match records, is converted to one or more service calls to the endpoint.
- Prompts, results, and data from any one call is never shared or accessible to other calls by other users of the service. Including business data with prompts improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from the Business Central database. Business Central selects this data and retrieves it using Business Central's standard mechanisms for data access, ensuring that Copilot can only access the same data as the user operating Copilot. Copilot has no way to circumvent Business Central’s security, privacy, and compliance controls.  
- User input and business data might include personal information, depending on the task.
- Prompt and output data might be stored for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but Microsoft only reviews the data if the automated systems flag it for review.
- Microsoft doesn't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models.

> [!NOTE]
> When administrators activate a Copilot feature or enable data movement to Azure OpenAI Service, the entire company database remains in its location:
>
> - It isn't transferred to the Azure OpenAI Service.
> - It isn't moved to another geographic region.
> - AI isn't trained on that data.  

## Example Copilot features and their data flow

For a high-level understanding of the data sent to Azure OpenAI Service, the following table provides three examples of how Business Central sends prompts and data to the service.

The table isn't an exhaustive list of features and doesn't provide a complete and accurate picture of every data point sent to the service.

|Copilot feature|Example of user interaction|Example of data sent to Azure OpenAI Service|
|-|-|-|
|Chat|User asks Copilot to "show customer Adatum" |<ul><li>System instructions to interpret and act on the user's message, including system-defined constraints and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of most likely table and page names, the list of available field names for those objects, along with descriptive information such as teaching tips and tooltips.</li></ul>| 
|Analysis assist|While viewing the Items list, the user asks Copilot to display "items by category" |<ul><li>System instructions to generate an analysis tab, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of column captions from the Items list, along with tooltips and similar descriptive information.</li><li>If the list includes option fields with predefined values, the possible values are included</li></ul>|
|Bank account reconciliation assist|User activates the **Reconcile** Copilot action on the details page |<ul><li>System instructions to compare records, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of bank statement lines (transaction descriptions, dates, and amounts) that the user requested Copilot to process. Additionally, the minimal list of bank account ledger entry records or G/L account names they're compared with.</li></ul>|

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Setup best practices: Reordering policies

The **Reordering Policy** field on item cards has planning methods that determine how the individual planning parameters interact.  

One best-practice foundation for selecting a reordering policy is the item’s ABC classification. When you use ABC classification, you manage items according to three classes. The class you use depends on the item's value and volume relative to the total stock. The following table shows the value-volume distribution of the three classes.

|Class|Percent of total stock volume|Percent of total stock value|
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|A|10-20|50-70|
|B|20|20|
|C|60-70|10-30|

The ABC classification states that effort and money can be saved by applying looser control to items of low value-volume than to items of high value-volume. The following illustration shows which reordering policy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is best suited for A, B, and C items respectively.

![ABC Classification.](media/abc_classification.png "abc_classification")

The following table provides best practices for selecting between the four policies.  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|**Order**|Use for A items.<br /><br /> Use for make-to-order items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for top-level items and for expensive components and subassemblies.<br /><br /> Use for items that are purchased as drop shipments and special orders.<br /><br /> Don't use if you don't accept automatic reservation.|A items, such as leather couches in a furniture store, are high-value items with low and irregular order velocity where inventory is unacceptable, or the required attributes vary.

# Design details: costing methods

The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Together with the posting date and sequence, the costing method also influences how the cost flow is recorded.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change an item's costing method if item ledger entries exist for the item. For more information, see [Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

The following methods are supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

| Costing method | Description | When to use |
|--|--|--|
| FIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. | In business environments where product cost is stable.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.)<br /><br /> For items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date. |
| LIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. | Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates.) |
| Average | An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that all inventories are sold simultaneously. | In business environments where product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> When inventories are piled or mixed together and can't be differentiated, such as chemicals. |
| Specific | An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. | In production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> For items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> For items with serial numbers. |
| Standard | An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values. | Where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> In repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Where there's discipline and staff to maintain standards. |

The following image shows how costs flow through the inventory for each costing method.  

![Costing methods visualized.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_7_costing_methods.png "Costing methods visualized")  

Costing methods differ in the way that they value inventory decreases and if they use actual cost or standard cost as the valuation base. The following table explains the different characteristics. (The LIFO method is excluded, as it's similar to the FIFO method.)

## Example

This section gives examples of how different costing methods affect inventory value.  

The following table shows the inventory increases and decreases that the examples are based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|1|1|  
|01-01-20|1|2|  
|01-01-20|1|3|  
|02-01-20|-1|4|  
|03-01-20|-1|5|  
|04-01-20|-1|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting quantity in inventory is zero. Consequently, the inventory value must also be zero, regardless of the costing method.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Increases  

For items with costing methods that use actual cost as the valuation base (**FIFO**, **LIFO**, **Average**, or **Specific**), inventory increases are valued at the item's acquisition cost.  

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

#### Standard  

For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Decreases

- **FIFO**  

    For items using the **FIFO** costing method, items that were purchased first are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the first inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the first inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **FIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|6|  

- **LIFO**  

    For items using the **LIFO** costing method, items that were purchased most recently are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the last inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the most recent inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **LIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------|--------|--------------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-30.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|  

- **Average**  

    For items using the **Average** costing method, inventory decreases are valued by calculating a weighted average of the remaining inventory on the last day of the average cost period in which the inventory decrease was posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md).  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Average** costing method.  

    | Posting Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | 02-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 4 |
    | 03-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 5 |
    | 04-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 6 |

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory decreases are valued similar to the **FIFO** costing method, except valuation is based on a standard cost, not on the actual cost.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Standard** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-15.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-15.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-15.00|6|  

- **Specific**  

    Costing methods make an assumption about how cost flows from an inventory increase to an inventory decrease. However, if more accurate information about the cost flow exists, then you can override this assumption by creating a fixed application between entries. A fixed application creates a link between an inventory decrease and a specific inventory increase and directs the cost flow accordingly.  

    For items that use the **Specific** costing method, inventory decreases are valued according to the inventory increase that the fixed application links it to.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Specific** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Applies-to Entry|Entry No.|
    |------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-20.00|**2**|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-10.00|**1**|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|**3**|6|

# Set up rules for automatic application of payments

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you set up rules to govern how payment text (on a bank transaction) is automatically matched with text on related open (unpaid) invoices, credit memos, or other entries when you use the **Apply Automatically** function on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. For more information, see [Reconcile payments using automatic application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

You set up new payment application rules by choosing which types of data on a payment reconciliation journal line must match with data on one or more open entries before the related payment is automatically applied to the open entries. The quality of each automatic application is shown as a value of **Low** to **High** in the **Match Confidence** field on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page according to the payment application rule that was used.

Each row on the **Payment Application Rules** page represents a payment application rule. Rules are applied in the order specified by the **Sorting Order** field. If multiple rules are used simultaneously, then the match confidence of the highest sorted rule is used.

The automatic application function is based on prioritized matching criteria. First the function tries, in prioritized order, to match text in the five **Related-Party** fields on a journal line with text in the bank account, name, or address of customers or vendors with unpaid documents representing open entries. Then, the function tries to match text in the **Transaction Text** and **Additional Transaction Info** fields on a journal line with text in the **External Document No.** and **Document No.** fields on open entries. Last, the function tries to match the amount in the **Statement Amount** field on a journal line with the amount on open entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Text matching is only possible for text longer than four characters.

In addition to the matching criteria, the following applies concerning the sign of the payment amount:

- For negative amounts, a match is made first against open entries representing customer invoices and then against vendor credit memos.
- For positive amounts, a match is made first against open entries representing vendor invoices and then against customer credit memos.

## To set up a payment application rule
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Application Rules**, and then choose the related link.
2. Define a new or edited payment application rule by filling the fields on a line as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|**Match Confidence**|Specifies your confidence in the application rule that you define on the line. <br /></br>A value that you specify in this field is shown in the **Match Confidence** field on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page according to the quality of the automatic payment application on the journal line.|
|**Priority**|Specifies the priority of the application rule relative to other application rules that are defined as lines on the **Payment Application Rules** page. 1 represents the highest priority.|
|**Related Party Matched**|Specifies how much information about the customer or vendor, such as address, city name, and bank account number, on the payment reconciliation journal line must match with information about the open entry before the application rule will be used to automatically apply the payment to the open entry.|
|**Document No./Ext. Document No. Matched**|Specifies whether text on the payment reconciliation journal line must match with the value in the **Document No.** field or the **External Document No.** field on the open entry before the application rule will be used to automatically apply the payment to the open entry.|
|**Number of Entries Within Amount Tolerance Found**|Specifies how many entries for a customer or vendor must match the amount including payment tolerance before the application rule will be used to automatically apply a payment to the open entry.|
|**Review Required**|Specifies whether the automatic payment application is recommended for manual review by the user before posting. Choosing the **Lines to Review** field on the **Payment Application Journal** page starts a guided experience where you can easily review multiple applications in a sequence on the **Payment Application Review** page.|

The following table describes the standard payment application rules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Important]
> The payment application rules may be different in your implementation of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
